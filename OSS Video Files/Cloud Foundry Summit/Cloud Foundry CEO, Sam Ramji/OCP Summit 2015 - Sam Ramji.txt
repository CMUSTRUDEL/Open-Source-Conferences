please welcome to the stage CEO of

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:28,189
global foundry IV cloud foundry Sam

00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:29,990
ramji good morning good to see all of

00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,629
you has the coffee working kicking in

00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,940
this is always sort of the slow laws

00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:36,710
you've been sitting isolated in your

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,809
chairs trying to figure out what the

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,900
next thing is going to be and marshaling

00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:43,280
your attention I'm going to talk about

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,600
linux and open source beyond the tipping

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,739
point and pick up on some of the themes

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,719
you've heard this morning I thought

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:50,390
Aaron did an outstanding job raising our

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,160
sites to developers and development I am

00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,710
the CEO of Cloud Foundry foundation it

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,660
is a new foundation and an existing open

00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,070
source project most importantly it's

00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,719
part of the Linux Foundation it is a

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,329
Linux Foundation collaborative project

00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,949
so we get to have a voice in a range of

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,869
different open source projects it's

00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:07,220
important because this has been an age

00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:09,229
of open source for at least a decade

00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,460
open source itself has been around for

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:12,740
at least two decades or more depending

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,560
on how you count it but where it's true

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,320
that we're in an age of foundations

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,810
every single graphic you see up here

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,150
every logo is represented by a

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,939
foundation to create large-scale

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,549
collaborative development some of these

00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,500
are brand new in the last 12 months the

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,560
node foundation drone code the.net

00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,400
foundation Cloud Foundry all

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,310
individually multi-million dollar

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,979
foundations governing hundreds of

00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,130
millions of dollars in development

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:44,689
supporting multi-billion dollar markets

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,460
so these are crucial and these lessons

00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,079
that we've learned across how do you do

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,600
good governance how do we have optimism

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,689
how do we have transparence how do we

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,860
have transparency how do we do

00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:56,479
management of competition as well as

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,659
collaboration at scale it's one of the

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,479
things that very few people touch co-op

00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:04,340
edition is real everyone who opens and

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,509
creates interoperability and thinks

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,709
they're giving something away also

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:11,090
wonders how do I keep my company going

00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:13,070
but you can keep companies going on this

00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,320
and in fact we now this year have our

00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,150
second Red Hat we've been asking for a

00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,700
while when we have another purely open

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,100
source publicly traded company

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,230
Hortonworks went public last fall with a

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,150
billion-dollar IPO right this is a great

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,090
hallmark of what's new and open source

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,790
not only is open source no longer repli

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,069
cating older technologies but completely

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:37,940
brand new problems are being solved such

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:40,750
as the Hadoop ecosystem Hadoop hive HDFS

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,620
solving for big data analytics at scale

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,180
hortonworks has built their business on

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,790
that has already gone public but it's

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,440
not just hortonworks Cloudera who many

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,879
of you have heard about have just

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,980
released their earnings for the first

00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,959
time as a privately held company this is

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,340
fairly unusual but the growth is so good

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,709
that they felt that it was important to

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,549
do this to show the commercial success

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,290
of open-source today in big data so one

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,670
hundred percent growth over a hundred

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,980
million dollars in annual revenue

00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,450
already nearly brand new company and

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,579
sixty percent of that revenue is

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,980
subscription revenue that's very very

00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:14,390
good numbers for those investors who are

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,040
looking at how do we build an

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,560
open-source business model how do we

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,390
enable commercialization of these types

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,410
of technologies at scale so there are

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:28,190
models and lessons here made available

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:30,650
in the late 2000s I had the privilege of

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,420
running open source for Microsoft now

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,549
clearly the companies come a long way

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,690
this is certainly a quote that would not

00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,730
have happened when I was working for

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,730
steve ballmer back in the day but such

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,049
an adela has clearly grasped the future

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,239
of computing and turned the company

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,310
toward it this quote that microsoft

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,319
loves linux is absolutely stunning now

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,209
clearly there well represented here as a

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,220
member of the Open Compute foundation

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,950
they're also part of node they're

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,480
working or the open source net which is

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,720
a huge change for them they've created

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,180
the dotnet foundation so if any last

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,280
bastion existed in the world of

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,069
believing that proprietary development

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,630
only was the way to go then this slide

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,120
if nothing else should convince you that

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,609
that time is gone Microsoft loves Linux

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,109
you can trust it it comes directly from

00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,109
the CEO he stated this last year

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,260
successful companies built on open

00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,970
source do so because they're able to

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,970
capture innovation and add their own

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,130
value faster so GoPro a hero brand

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,169
probably the preeminent social media

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,650
marketing brand that you've seen the

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:36,650
space jump the Red Bull advertisements

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,750
they built their entire system on top of

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,419
Linux because it was able to take their

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,920
core hardware and get them up to user

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:44,720
level experience as much faster

00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,250
they could have done any other way this

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,260
is sort of the key to open source

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,790
innovation and powering commercial

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,860
business models you have to add your

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,240
value but if you are thoughtful about

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,720
what's available for you and open source

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,810
you can get there much faster Tesla is a

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,180
great example of a state-of-the-art

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,250
dashboard and console again probably the

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,620
best in-dash digital console experience

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,840
of of any car company on the planet

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,820
right now almost entirely based on open

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,230
source and if you want to go and have

00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,480
that experience just drive a little ways

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,680
up the road to their facility at fremont

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,660
while you're here in the bay area and

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,130
you'll be able to get the tour and take

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,740
a look at this but it's not just Tesla

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,840
it's also Jaguar Land Rover it's Toyota

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,240
there's an entire open source project on

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,900
top of Linux called a GL automotive

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,430
grade Linux so the ability to share best

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,600
practices to be able to share the source

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,320
code that implements those best

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,370
practices enables each company to

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,190
differentiate themselves based on what

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,350
they're uniquely wonderful add so that's

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,270
the nature of open source contribution

00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,740
but none of you necessarily are in the

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,450
car business you're in the IT business

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,910
and IT infrastructure as you know has

00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,710
changed we're not running mainframes on

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,020
tape drives anymore we've moved to cloud

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,390
computing almost every single thing that

00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:00,260
you see in cloud computing is open

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:02,660
source when we think about what defines

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,580
the cloud we're looking at things like

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,900
core OS and docker right the open source

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,520
projects are actually defining the

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,680
market segments now what is

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,290
containerization it's a set of open

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,120
source projects built on Linux right the

00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,660
open the the operating system for cloud

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,770
workloads cloudstack and OpenStack

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,750
defining infrastructure as a Service

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,820
Cloud Foundry and openshift defining

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,860
platform-as-a-service networking with

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,100
open daylight and OPN Fe I'll come back

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,350
to all of these but the aliveness of the

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,080
innovation the active sharing and the

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,970
creation of new value is happening right

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,350
here right now in these stacks and we

00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,810
will continue to drive it forward

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:42,500
through foundations that can help you

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:45,710
govern them effectively one good example

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,900
is that the Linux Foundation is now

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,000
released numbers on contribution to the

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,560
Linux kernel we have more first-time

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,230
contributors than ever before in the

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,360
last 12 months over 4,000 developers

00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,610
contributed Linux nearly half of whom

00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,469
were

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,539
first time contributors that's an

00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:02,460
amazing statistic it tells you that

00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,319
Linux is far from salt because as we

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,939
keep building new hardware you need to

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,710
keep modifying the operating system

00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,659
extending and expanding it in a way that

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,500
is most efficiently done by open

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:15,090
platforms and open operating systems

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,330
companies are vying for the top spot

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,919
you'll see that this top 15 contrib

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,740
contributors list changes constantly

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,449
over time Intel in Red Hat constantly

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,669
swapping places you can see that this is

00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:28,379
a way to make your mark on the industry

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:31,439
to be able to make sure that you have

00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,300
control of your future and make sure

00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,770
that your commercial plans are coherent

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,870
with where the community is going so you

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,689
can reduce your own unnecessary

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,279
additional effort one thing that I call

00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,199
out here that's important for all open

00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,870
communities to pay attention to is we've

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,550
long underrepresented women so the Foss

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:53,009
outreach program for women identified 24

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,979
key potential contributors created

00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:59,039
sponsorships and fellowships starting

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:01,169
about 12 months ago just by the end of

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,719
the year this group of twenty four

00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:05,699
interns had already reached the top 15

00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:07,229
contributor slots because they were in

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,719
brate they were engaged they were

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:11,190
partnered up with mentors from the

00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,779
colonel community people who are already

00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,300
Colonel contributors and Colonel leaders

00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:17,129
with explicit goal of saying let's let's

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,690
provide some enablement here so I think

00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,400
it's fantastic it's a it's a terrific

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,129
outcome hopefully a pointer to where

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:29,330
other communities can go to be more open

00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:31,589
and heterogeneous bridges are valuable

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,130
open source projects are the roads and

00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:36,599
the bridges of the internet those of you

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,329
who are in the Bay Area or who have

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,469
driven here in the last week well know

00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:42,690
that there's a brand new bridge

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:45,209
stretching from San Francisco Oakland is

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,089
built for 6.5 billion dollars because

00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:49,470
bridges have value if you drive up to

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,930
Napa while you're here you across the

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,630
northbound i-680 build for 1.3 billion

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,640
dollars almost ten years ago so we can

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,899
claim open source now creates billions

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,250
of dollars of value and touches all of

00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,079
our lives there's no way that you live

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,310
through every day without using a

00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,470
tremendous amount of open source you

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,790
just don't even have to pay attention to

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,350
it much as erin was saying you're

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,080
sitting inside the cockpit of a car you

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:15,380
don't know it so we could claim we've

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,380
Golden Age of open source or have we

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:23,190
anybody recognize this logo somebody

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,350
said heartbleed okay so that's

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:29,400
interesting when a security exploit has

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:31,920
brand presence right you know that you

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:36,270
have a certain class of problems here

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,950
are a few other brand presences so the

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,100
entire core infrastructure of the

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,690
internet is based on open source but we

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,340
haven't been doing as good a job as we

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,890
need to to take care of it there was a

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:51,600
range of very serious vulnerabilities

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:54,350
that were identified tact solved for but

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,730
it created huge windows huge instability

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,260
it's not just an open source problem

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,120
clearly we've had these kinds of

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,340
zero-day vulnerabilities in proprietary

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,750
products for a long time but we need to

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,440
make sure that we're working together to

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,970
make open source secure so if Lina says

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,010
law is true that given enough eyeballs

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,730
all bugs are shallow why do we have all

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,380
these problems when we look at how we've

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,870
been building the internet does anybody

00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,310
know who this is this is harlan sten he

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,730
is the timekeeper of the internet

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,290
anybody know ntp right network Time

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,990
Protocol he was making less than 25

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,180
thousand dollars a year this was his

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,340
full-time job just scraping by right

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,570
imagine father time where it scraping by

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,620
on twenty five thousand dollars a year

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,930
this is how you make sure that all of

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,350
your clocks in sync so that you avoid an

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,810
entire class of security exploits you

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,370
have werner cook in germany canoe PG new

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,360
PG is not just for personal email

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,070
encryption but this is how we know

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,020
software packages are what they claim to

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:53,030
be they are signed with the correct

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:55,350
public key going broke the openssl team

00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,850
who became famous because of the

00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,650
heartbleed exploit they were getting

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,470
less than two thousand dollars a year in

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,270
donations unbelievable they meant for

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,610
for the first time on a linux foundation

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,980
sponsorship last year right getting

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,240
together in person to solve for some of

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,550
the architectural challenges they had

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,890
here's theatre rod openssh if you've

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,630
ever gone into a box and tried to

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,610
configure it securely you've been using

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,940
this code right working part time jobs

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,110
to make ends meet and chat ramey

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,490
maintainer of bash anybody who's using

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,410
modern shells

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:29,850
certainly using bash working nearly

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:32,010
alone so what are we doing about it this

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,270
is a very famous moment in American

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,130
history this bridge was the most

00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,520
traveled in Minnesota this is the i-35

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,440
West but august first 2007 it collapsed

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,990
killing 13 people is not something that

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,440
we're very happy about heartbleed was

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,529
the i-35 west of open source it allowed

00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,990
us to galvanize attention attract people

00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:53,250
to think about solving this problem it's

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,130
a hard problem because software's

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,839
complex secure code is hard to write and

00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,970
maintain one of the reasons Windows

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,770
Vista was late a decade ago was not

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,380
because it was badly engineered quite

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:06,060
the opposite every developer had to go

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,520
through security training a secure

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,620
development lifecycle led by an industry

00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,260
visionary Michael Howard he pointed out

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,990
to us all all of you developers you know

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,890
how to add features and do things so

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,010
that they run the way they're supposed

00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,959
to you don't know how to make them not

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,370
run the way they're not supposed to it's

00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,380
a completely different discipline of

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,640
software engineering and then finally

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,290
because we want to be able to fix

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,130
open-source market failures without

00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:34,140
screwing up what's made us work so we

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,690
can fix it because we share the same

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,070
software code we can leverage shared

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,360
testing environments so even if you're

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,000
not going to contribute to the code you

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,839
can certainly contribute defects

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,380
everybody is paying attention to these

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,630
large-scale CVEs registries abilities to

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,220
deliver this information we can share

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,290
best practices so it can be easier to

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,279
write secure code so we're attacking the

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,560
problem by creating the core

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,829
infrastructure initiative so what is the

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,990
CII CI is all about taking a pre-emptive

00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:03,810
approach to cybersecurity it does three

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,180
things first helps projects in need so

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,980
all those projects I described before

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,110
they are now receiving funding money

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,440
attention at a scale that would make you

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,370
not embarrassed that would that allows

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,060
you to know that you have the right

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:21,779
people unable to solve hard problems

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:23,370
second conducting a security census the

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,930
core infrastructure census is about

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,100
finding what are all the projects that

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,170
we're relying on that we've never even

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,550
taken a look at to understand their core

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,829
security vulnerabilities and getting

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,420
ahead of this problem the second time

00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:36,040
and then third establishing secure

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,660
development best practices

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,300
we have tremendous funding from industry

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,880
giants and challenge may be to ask

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,040
yourself how you can help so you can

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,870
point out projects that are in trouble

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
you can point out projects that haven't

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,380
been maintained that you're depending on

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,690
that you're concerned about you can take

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,160
hold of the core infrastructure census

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,630
and improve it what are the questions

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,639
that aren't asked it should be asked and

00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,019
finally you can get your company to join

00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,880
the core infrastructure initiative and

00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,470
be part of making the Internet and the

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,430
cloud that we're relying on secure from

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:10,209
end and so let me close on a different

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,920
note now that we've hopefully taken some

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:13,660
responsibility for each of our

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,940
contribution to the problem and the

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,970
solution for security let's ask the

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,440
question how far can open source go

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,690
clearly I picked this image because I

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,639
think it can go way over the horizon

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,319
farther than we can imagine we're still

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,500
in the 10 yard line for open source in

00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:32,230
this century taking just a subset of

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,910
projects here docker Cloud Foundry node

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,709
probably all of you have heard of these

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,870
projects and certainly no Open Compute

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,819
probably open daylight for

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,560
software-defined networking probably OPI

00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:43,630
NFV for a network function

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,630
virtualization and OpenStack of course

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,639
if we allow these to just sort of

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,019
evolved on their own we don't know

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,449
exactly where it's going to go but

00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,940
they'll certainly go somewhere great but

00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:56,529
if we seek harmony if we start asking

00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,170
ourselves what would a top-to-bottom

00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,660
Open Compute stack look like for the

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,940
global cloud how can we create an open

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,740
cloud computing platform for everybody

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,190
on the planet for the rest of the

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,730
century and beyond it might look

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:14,680
something like this so consider this a

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,790
call to action right if we start

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,170
thinking about our dependence on

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,910
hardware and opening hardware our

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,709
dependence on carrier networking which

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,620
is invisible too many people and make

00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:25,209
that open as we look at software-defined

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,579
networking so that we can make all these

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:29,620
different components work correctly as

00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:31,209
we can orchestrate them naturally data

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,910
center operating systems virtual

00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:35,230
machines that sit on top of that

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,970
operating systems like Linux long open

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,100
but how do we harmonize new things like

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,959
Cloud Foundry so that you can have an

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,029
application developer building apps that

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,449
naturally communicate with hints all

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:47,920
through the stack so this entire set of

00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:49,690
infrastructure can respond dynamically

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,220
and adapt to what you need

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,110
containers like docker and programming

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,480
frameworks like node these are just a

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,460
few examples of what the course dad

00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,430
could be but let's start raising this
