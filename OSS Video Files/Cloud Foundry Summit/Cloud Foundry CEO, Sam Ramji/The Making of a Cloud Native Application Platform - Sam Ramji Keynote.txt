Title: The Making of a Cloud Native Application Platform - Sam Ramji Keynote
Publication date: 2016-03-18
Playlist: Cloud Foundry CEO, Sam Ramji
Description: 
	From OSCON 2015: It wasn’t too long ago that artisans, bathed in the glow of molten metal, forged parts that would go on to make up bigger, more powerful machines. Today, we call those artisans developers. Instead of metal, they use bits and bytes in the cloud to forge a modern application architecture.

It’s an architecture built for velocity and choice. One that enables companies to build applications quickly and deploy them wherever they need to go, whether public, private, or hybrid environments. And it’s built on a growing, vibrant ecosystem of ecosystems.

In this talk, I’ll give you a look at the technologies driving this new level of speed and efficiency for application developers (such tech as containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenStack, and Cloud Foundry). And I’ll explain why many prominent members of the Fortune 500 are building their futures on this modern application architecture.
