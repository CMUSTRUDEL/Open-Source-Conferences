Description: 
	SOD Microservices - Daniel Jones, EngineerBetter

In the clamour to deploy all the things as microservices, the development community seems to have forgotten about Service-Oriented Design - an architectural code style that allows systems to start as monoliths, and be easily broken into microservices only when required. We’ll look at what exactly Service-Oriented Design is, how to apply Service-Oriented Design in Java Spring apps, and discuss how a forward-looking monolith-first approach can save engineering time and effort.
