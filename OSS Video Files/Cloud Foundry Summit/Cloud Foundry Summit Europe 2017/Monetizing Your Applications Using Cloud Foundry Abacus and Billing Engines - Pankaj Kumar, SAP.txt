	Monetizing Your Applications Using Cloud Foundry Abacus and Billing Engines - Pankaj Kumar, SAP

This session will demonstrate how CF Abacus is used for metering your applications. Based on this we can monetize on various attributes like API Calls, Resources consumed etc. This session will include an end to end scenario of enabling metering for an existing application. Followed by pushing the metered data into a rating and billing system there by triggering an invoice to the customer. The demo will use the knowledge and experience we have gathered at SAP in monetizing some of our cloud solutions using Cloud Foundry.
