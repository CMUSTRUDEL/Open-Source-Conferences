Description: 
	Highly Available Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes - Vlad Iovanov, SUSE

In this talk the presenters will present how SUSE Cloud Foundry is deployed and configured to run in a highly available fashion. We will show how we avoid SPOFs using Kubernetes features like stateful sets, readiness and liveness probes, etc. Furthermore, we will show how the end user of SCF can deploy applications without worrying about downtime. The presentation will include a demo of a disruptive agent simulating failures across the Kubernetes nodes and containers, while user applications are still live and healthy.
