	Advanced Vulnerability Management in Cloud Foundry - Molly Crowther & Stephen Levine, Pivotal

Forbes Insights reported in 2016 that 44% of all data breaches are caused by known software vulnerabilities.

This session will cover the CF security philosophy, background of security management for Cloud Foundry, and a demo of how the team has automated the process from data ingestion through to publicized fix information. Molly and Stephen will talk about how their unique team is changing how OSS projects secure against known vulnerabilities.
