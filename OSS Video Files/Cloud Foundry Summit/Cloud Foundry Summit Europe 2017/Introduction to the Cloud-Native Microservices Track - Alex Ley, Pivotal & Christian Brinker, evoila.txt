welcome to the cloud native

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,490
microservices track today he wills and

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,040
tomorrow you will see something about

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,200
how to make cloud native micro-services

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,719
and what's interesting about and we want

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,439
to show you some insights what you are

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,230
facing in the next two days yes so a

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,420
quick quick introduction we are the

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,830
track co-chairs so we've been putting

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,349
together the track finding some awesome

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,390
talks there was you know for almost like

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,099
a hundred submissions for this track we

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,739
had two will it down to no fifteen talks

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,809
so hopefully you'll be enjoying those my

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,520
name is Alex Lai I'm from pivotal I work

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,670
on Cloud Foundry and pivotal Cloud

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,640
Foundry and my name is Christian Britta

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,219
I work at a viola and as a senior

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,550
software developer working on and with

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:55,199
cloud foundry so what should you expect

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:58,199
to learn from this track most legacy

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,750
code is some monolithic application and

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,650
which has to be transformed in some way

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,880
to work with Cloud Foundry because you

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,880
want to have it more in the

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,670
microservices way what you will hear

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,619
today and tomorrow is how do you achieve

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,909
this by some key technologies in the

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:21,630
transformation which patterns you can

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:26,340
use to achieve that and like spring boot

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:29,400
nodejs or steel chair for dotnet and how

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,270
that can be used to transform your

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,420
applications but also this introduces

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,180
some complexity to your system because

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,729
many different applications in our

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,799
microservice system are interacting with

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,970
each other it's highly distributed and

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,860
you have to observe that state to

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,259
observer to debug it to the back of this

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,810
interaction and the Turks will show you

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:59,909
how you can you achieve this life and in

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:02,880
production great and so why is this

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,829
important to the industry as a whole so

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,689
we see companies being pushed by their

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,170
customers to move faster deliver more

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,129
value and they won't do this quickly

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,050
enterprises have startups hot on their

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,360
tails trying to disrupt them

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,040
and you know enterprise IT has been

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,810
plagued by these long-running software

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,040
projects the over-budget

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,520
they don't deliver the value they

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,140
expected and they take years and so we

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,180
see now as a time for these companies to

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,190
really transform how they develop their

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:35,580
software oh and also kind of by doing

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,080
this we see micro services as one part

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,330
of this solution and so this will allow

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,560
companies to change how they do charlie

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,790
build their software how they scale

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,830
their organisation scale their

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:48,150
development teams and ultimately deliver

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:50,640
more value for their customers and now

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,460
we want to highlight some sessions in

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,370
this track we think which show how this

00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:59,670
track is showing you the the interesting

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,430
parts there are all other tracks ours so

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,250
interesting but they're the the key ones

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,550
with we think about the first one is

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:13,230
from Johnny Evan here from IBM he will

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:16,800
show in his talk how they stood in front

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,610
of their bluemix UI and which was a

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,680
monolithic java application and they

00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,340
make several micro service out of it

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,730
with no GS base which sounds very

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,890
interesting to me and the next talk I

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:36,060
want to point out is later this evening

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,640
from Danny Jones who's want to show how

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,459
you can use service-oriented design to

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,230
start with a monolithic application your

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,709
development cycle and then shrink it

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,690
down to my pro services often you if you

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,870
talk about micro services people think

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,930
about I must make directly from the

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:59,790
start my micro services but starting

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:04,290
with a monolith can chief here time save

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,670
time and engineering effort yeah and

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,470
also just on this one I didn't know he

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,390
was here last year for the keynotes

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,580
in Frankfort for 1200 summit but Dan

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,510
Jones gave an excellent keynote there so

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,049
I'm quite looking forward to this talk

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,220
as well so coming up you know closing

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,080
the day out we're going to be learning

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,440
more about how to build resilient micro

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,510
services using.net core and Steel Toe so

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,430
steel shows an awesome new framework for

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,889
building micro services using

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,410
kind of inspired by the spring boot way

00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,360
of developing microservices that's gonna

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,330
be with Zac Brown and Matthew Horan from

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,669
pivotal and then tomorrow we've got :

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,410
Brian from Google and she's going to be

00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:43,930
talking about live debugging with cloud

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,000
foundry and stackdriver and so this is

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,300
really interesting because it's how you

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,650
do this in production and yeah it's

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,360
really like doing it live it's gonna be

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,210
really cool talk so definitely recommend

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,530
coming to that tomorrow and so you can

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,960
share your pictures and quotes from this

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,010
track hashtag CF summit you can come up

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,250
and talk to me in question we're gonna

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,660
be around today tomorrow so yeah hope

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,940
you enjoy the track we're just gonna do

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,940
