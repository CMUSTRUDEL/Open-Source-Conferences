all right I'm Jeff Tomer from

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:10,139
virtustream I'm on the cloud

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,500
architecture team and I'm here to

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:16,350
provide a lightning introduction to a

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,539
very new service offering for us and

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:23,210
that's a virtuous dream pivotal cloud

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:28,279
foundry service the premise is simple

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:35,100
first we understand that deploying and

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:37,770
maintaining a PCF platform is very

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,170
complex second we know that we can solve

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,590
that complexity through our

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,620
infrastructure expertise comprehensive

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,010
automation and tooling and managed

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,670
services from provisioning of the

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,610
network storage and compute components

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:59,730
to customer onboarding from bootstrap

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,250
through lifecycle management the

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,330
virtustream PCF service is designed with

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:15,630
security scale and availability as the

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:18,170
primary objectives but more simply our

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:24,240
intent is to be your trusted provider

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:25,710
providing proactive servicing management

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,810
through extensive monitoring and

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,840
resource capabilities and with timely

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:37,049
capacity management patching and

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:43,170
upgrades so we intend to provide to you

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:48,540
the the platform that's both hosted and

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:50,579
managed by virtuous stream also key to

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,200
the offering is our ability to extend

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:58,530
tea to extend your cloud native app to

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,079
consume your systems of record that are

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,119
either hosted at purchased stream and

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,970
the virtual storage entropy enterprise

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:12,190
cloud or on Prem and that enables you to

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:15,160
deploy your

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,840
application enterprise application

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:25,879
richer enterprise applications and

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:29,080
services so on it's our offering is

00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,879
designed to be appurtenant offering and

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,900
the intent there is that delivers the

00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:38,930
highest enterprise class security model

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,910
the offering also includes microwave vm

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,780
based metering so you can continue to

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:47,410
use the consumption based billing model

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,340
you're familiar with virtustream

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:57,160
initially we provide for backing

00:02:52,340 --> 00:03:00,230
services those are Redis rabbitmq

00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,980
supreme cloud services and my sequel of

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:06,319
course it's sized for very large

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:13,220
workloads with capacity up to hundreds

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:17,269
of custom large ai's and terabytes plus

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:22,790
of storage capacity per tenant initially

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:25,549
I also want to mention that expansion of

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:29,299
resource capacity to meet increased

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:35,660
demands is built into the design so you

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:38,780
need more will get you more also in

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,720
terms of sizing if you're when you're

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,180
interested in figuring out how much you

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,889
need to consume it's important to

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,650
mention that the pivotal sizing tool is

00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,780
a key resource and we'll work with you

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,720
and use it to determine specific

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,510
capacities and requirements to run your

00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:02,720
cloud native app on the virtustream PCF

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:06,169
service it's also key for us to be able

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,209
to onboard new customers in days and

00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:11,780
we're going to be able to achieve that

00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:15,919
and after onboarding you'll have the

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:20,229
ability to self-serve or use directed

00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,229
service for service requests

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:25,699
our goal ultimately is to enable you to

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,949
accelerate your transition to cloud

00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:30,620
native application delivery and to

00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:33,169
provide you with a rich set of tools and

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,629
an engagement model that enables you to

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,280
focus your efforts where they count most

00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:42,050
and that's of course differentiating

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,690
your business and to do it to get you

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,389
started all you need to bring to us are

your bring us registered wildcard

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:59,710
domains SSL certs for those domains the

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:04,280
list of backing services and possibly

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:07,849
any requirements for MPLS or VP on VPN

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:11,810
connections to access hosted or on-prem

00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:17,810
backing services that your cloud native

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:19,759
app will connect to for more details we

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,319
encourage you to introduce yourself to

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,289
