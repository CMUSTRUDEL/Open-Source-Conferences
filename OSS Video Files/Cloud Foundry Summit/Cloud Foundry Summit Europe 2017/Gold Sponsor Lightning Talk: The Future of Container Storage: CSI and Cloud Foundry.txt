	Gold Sponsor Lightning Talk: The Future of Container Storage: CSI and Cloud Foundry - Julian Hjortshoj, Dell EMC

In early 2017, representatives from Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, Mesos and Docker convened a working group to create a common Container Storage Interface.  The intent of this interface is to provide a standard API that will allow a storage provider to write a single plugin that can attach their storage to any of the major container orchestrators.

In this talk, we will cover the design and logical flow of the Container Storage Interface, discuss its integration into Cloud Foundry, and look at some initial examples of storage plugin implementations.
