	Making a Mesh: A Primer on Istio Running on KuBo - Ramiro Salas, Pivotal

The concept of a service mesh represents a paradigm shift on application connectivity for distributed systems, with wide implications for analytics, policy and extensibility. In this talk, we will explain what a service mesh is, the power it brings to microservices, and its impact on Cloud Foundry and K8s, both separately and together. We will also discuss the implications for the traditional network infrastructure, and the shifting of responsibilities from L3/4 to L7.
