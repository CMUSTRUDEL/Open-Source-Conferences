having me I wasn't expecting to be up on

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,900
stage

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:58,270
we had a slight last-minute change but I

00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,270
think you for representing sa P younger

00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,040
ki was funny to be here but had

00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,530
something come up so we're excited

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,180
though to have mark here because mark is

00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,400
able to talk about one of my favorite

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:13,540
topics ecosystem but first s AP you know

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,690
it's been a founding member of the Cloud

00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,970
Foundry foundation and recently

00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,280
announced earlier this year that the s

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,610
AP cloud platform runs on Cloud Foundry

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,899
is officially out and open for business

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,960
there's been an exciting amount of buzz

00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:30,759
and interest around that talk a little

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,840
bit about the launch and what it did and

00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,179
what it represents for s AP I mean it's

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,280
huge for us ap I mean our our strategy

00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:41,619
is very much about how do we help our

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,860
customers innovate how do they take

00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:48,220
advantage of digital transformation

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,020
themselves but our customers also have a

00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,679
very diverse set of requirements so

00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,580
multi clouds as as your survey showed is

00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:58,780
is is super important to our customers

00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,090
you know we need to provide them with

00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,069
choice they often have regulatory

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,619
requirements or geographical

00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:07,330
requirements in terms of where they want

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:10,030
their applications where they need their

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,620
workloads managed so Modi cloud helps us

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,590
with that so you know we were very

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,200
pleased to announce the fact that s AP

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,810
cloud platform is available in AWS it's

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,420
available in Asia it's available in GCP

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,819
we also see you run it on our own data

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,940
centers as well so you know that choice

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:31,420
that flexibility that that ability to

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,730
provide our customers with you know

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,990
applications and innovation in the areas

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,459
and locations they need is critical for

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,769
absolutely so you're changing both s AP

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,629
and your customers yeah absolutely I

00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:45,459
mean I'm customer first at the end of

00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:46,849
the day and you know we want to take

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,160
advantage

00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:50,900
you know of the hype scale vendors we

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,370
want to take advantage of you know

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,400
best-in-class scalability and

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,050
availability absolutely one of the

00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,569
things that's been so fascinating to me

00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,670
about sa PE and it wasn't something that

00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:02,959
was readily noticeable to me before

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,090
being part of the cloud foundry

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,000
community is sa p's investment in

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:11,360
open-source and actually learned a lot

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,830
this morning even more on that but sa P

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,450
as I said has been a founding member of

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,150
the cloud foundry foundation since the

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,739
beginning but recently announced last

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,420
week at Tech Ed that it's now also a

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,370
platinum member of the cloud native

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,049
computing foundation if you talked a

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,599
little bit about the importance of open

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:29,180
source to sa P and the direction that

00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,670
ICP is taking it absolutely I think I

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,410
think an open source is maybe s ap

00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,319
second best kept secret off the cloud

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,720
platform right you know we'd we as you

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,110
mentioned you know we were a founding

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,140
member of of cloud foundry foundation

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,840
you know we see open source as you know

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,000
differentiator for us because we want to

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,819
take advantage of that broad ecosystem

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,579
the diversity that you talked about in

00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,139
your keynote you know within Claire

00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:58,639
foundry we've worked on a number of

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,889
projects right where there's around bosh

00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,170
whether it's around OpenStack CPI

00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,760
service fabric so there's a lot of a lot

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,790
of energy that our developers are

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,540
looking to put back in but we also think

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,370
it enables us to produce better software

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,889
for our customers and helps us

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,109
differentiate by taking advantage of

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:22,190
that that diversity but also making sure

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:24,200
that we we put a lot back in another

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,340
area where we've been very focused we

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,430
were one of the founding members of

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,460
Eclipse project you know that was the

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,110
the fun fact for today so yeah and I

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,639
mean on the tool sides I mean obviously

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,010
the discussion before about the

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,110
importance of tools we see that we see

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,860
that as well as we want to enable our

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:46,039
developers in our ecosystem partners you

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,160
know we're also member in Apache o lingo

00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:50,660
looking to drive standards around o data

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,340
which is critical in terms of you know

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,940
sharing information exchanging

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,940
exchanging beta we're super excited by

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,110
the changing name around Kubo and

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,450
obviously the

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,550
to focus on container runtimes as you

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,720
mentioned we've we recently announced

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:12,500
two weeks ago in Las Vegas that we were

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,620
also sort of joining CN CF you know we

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,220
see that need to to offer a diversity of

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,840
workloads right so we see a common

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,430
ground or that ability to sort of move

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,630
towards a common ground in terms of the

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,060
great work we're doing with Cloud

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,820
Foundry but also aligning that with with

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,950
the kubernetes community to take

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,880
advantage of both so yeah open source is

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,210
critical

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,010
it helps us help our customers and you

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,720
know we've been doing it a long time an

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,420
open source is a differentiator for you

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,950
which I feel like is is a game-changing

00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,080
moment in the conversation around open

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:48,050
source yeah absolutely I mean you know

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,510
we shouldn't forget that you know as a

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,520
as an application provider you know

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,050
there's a lot of experience and domain

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,120
expertise we have there but you know the

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,820
community is the community is king at

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,910
the end of the day absolutely we firmly

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,620
believe that here as well so I couldn't

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,010
have you up on stage and not talk about

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,470
the power of ecosystem as ap is a world

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,810
renowned for your partner ecosystem and

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,310
the innovation you do with your partners

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,440
you want to talk a little bit about what

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,840
that means for you and what cloud

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,290
platform represents for you absolutely

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,570
you know I think on the last

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,930
presentation there was some talk about

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,750
business model and business model change

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,700
you know platform as a business model is

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,520
ecosystem driven you know there is no

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,460
value without innovation occurring on

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,500
the platform so you know our our

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,310
strategy and our approach is to take our

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,230
15 thousands partners that we have and

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,710
and really sort of help them as they

00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,600
make that journey to the clouds but also

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,720
taking advantage of platform based

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,570
business models so you know we have over

00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,580
700 ISVs that are that are building

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,640
applications building scenarios that

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,200
augment sa piece called product and

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,880
deliver additional value it could be

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,640
line of business use case could be

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,050
industry use cases could be taking

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,910
advantage of a lot of the innovation

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,240
that we're driving on the platform which

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,190
I may

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,849
is gonna be the is going to be the next

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,430
question but you know we've got I think

00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:20,990
over a thousand sis and consulting

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,569
partners that are driving digital

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,960
transformation projects for our

00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:29,030
customers you know we've got a bunch of

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,979
developers around AB app that we're now

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,910
sort of you know enabling to bring to

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,610
the cloud through some of the

00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:37,280
announcements that we've made about you

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,860
know making app up available on Cloud

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,630
Foundry or on STP cloud platform so for

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,039
those of you that aren't familiar with

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,979
AB app what is that again

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,630
how about some language that sa P sort

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,240
of has been using for 40 years and

00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,789
there's been using to drive you know

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,080
application portfolio so we've got a few

00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:56,870
we've got a few developers out there

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,060
that love to stay current and we're

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,039
making sure that they are well it's not

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,780
to be confused with a dad from Star Wars

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:08,539
know BBN you'd have to call me the Star

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:11,690
Trek not with the star goes yeah Star

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:14,270
Trek but um you know on the topic of

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,430
innovation and the future where do you

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,900
see this going for SI p i mean sa p

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,539
cloud platform is just getting started

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,880
where do you see the future oh we're

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:26,990
getting started with 7,000 customers but

00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,639
yeah no I mean innovation is critical I

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,460
sort of mentioned the importance of Modi

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,510
clouds so that we can abstract the

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,070
instructure layer make it as accessible

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:40,579
everywhere but then we need to innovate

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,890
on top and really what we're looking at

00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:44,690
and is is how do we innovate around sort

00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,850
of three specific types of service so

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,560
you know one bringing our own sort of

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,360
technology services to bear on the

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,899
platform so you know things like honor

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,760
as the the market leading in memory

00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:59,180
database bring that onto onto the

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,920
platform looking at how we take our 40

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,660
years of industry experience and

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,190
delivering that as micro services that

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,529
can be reused so our customers and

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,870
partners can innovate using that

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:11,149
industry best practice and then the

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:15,170
third is out-and-out innovation services

00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:19,160
so you know we we launched a branding

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,630
around Leonardo at-at sapphire early in

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,720
the year and there we're sort of

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,480
bringing

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,480
our innovation labs capabilities around

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,360
things like machine learning and IOT and

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,730
blockchain and turning it into sort of

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,089
you know tangible business benefit right

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,639
so in machine learning we've we've

00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,920
introduced capabilities that automates

00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,649
invoice matching so that you can drive

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,519
automation within the business we've

00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,990
applied it to the recruitment process so

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,480
that you can do CV matching and

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,310
hopefully get better employees into the

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,459
business understand the skills that you

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:59,519
require and match those to the workforce

00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:02,100
that is out there around IOT we saw the

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,690
discussion around the digital twin we're

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,079
looking at how do we capture the digital

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:10,139
twin again as a set of services where we

00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:13,290
can we can you know speed innovation

00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,480
around around IOT and blockchain which

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,120
is sometimes a little bit more nebulous

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,089
you know weird looking into new

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,649
industries like or healthcare and life

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:24,779
sciences and looking at how we can do

00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:27,949
next generation trap-and-trace using

00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:30,029
blockchain to ensure authenticity of

00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:32,850
prescription drugs that are in the

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,019
marketplace so a lot of innovation it's

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,000
how we want to differentiate the

00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,610
platform because that's how we help our

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,250
customers drive more business value it's

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,199
exciting as ap is investing a lot

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,110
absolutely it's gonna change the

00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:48,120
landscape I think well thank you so much

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,759
for joining us here it's cloud foundry

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,120
summit Basel we're glad you are up here

00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,439

free you know if you go to cloud

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,110
