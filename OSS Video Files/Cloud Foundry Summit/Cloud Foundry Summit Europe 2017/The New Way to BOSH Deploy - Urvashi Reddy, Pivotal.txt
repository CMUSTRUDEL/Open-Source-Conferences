	The New Way to BOSH Deploy - Urvashi Reddy, Pivotal

Before BOSH 2.0, curating deployments required a great deal of orchestration from experienced users of BOSH. Often this was in the form of complex and fragile manifest generation scripts. BOSH 2.0 introduced a simple yet powerful feature for deploying: operations files. In this talk, we will take a deep dive into how to use operations files effectively and utilize them to create a variety of BOSH deployments with ease. Attendees will gain insight on best practices for authoring ops-files, as well as how they fit into a typical deployment workflow.
