	An Introduction to Cloud Foundry Core Development - Jen Spinney & Luan Santos, SUSE

Welcome to the Cloud Foundry community! This talk is designed for people who are new to the Cloud Foundry community or existing community members who haven't come in contact with core developers and the development practices of Cloud Foundry.

Cloud Foundry is proudly open source, and our open source contribution model is a little different from most other open source projects. In this talk, you'll learn about how the Cloud Foundry teams are structured, how they operate, and what a day in the life of a Cloud Foundry core developer looks like. Even if you don't plan to get involved with core development yourself, this talk will help you understand the perspective and terminology of the developers and product managers you may be interacting with. If you do plan on getting involved with core development, this talk will serve as an overview and introduction of what to expect when joining a team or making a pull request.
