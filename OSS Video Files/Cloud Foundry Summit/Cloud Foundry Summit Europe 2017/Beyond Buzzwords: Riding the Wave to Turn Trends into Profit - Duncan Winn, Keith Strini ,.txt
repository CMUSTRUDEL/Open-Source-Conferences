	Beyond Buzzwords: Riding the Wave to Turn Trends into Profit - Duncan Winn, Keith Strini & Sean Keery, Pivotal

We the Cloud Foundry community have spent a considerable time understanding and unpacking buzzword terms like Agile, Devops, Microservices and Cloud Native. This presentation goes beyond simply unpacking trends and terminology. It will bring you tangible real world examples - from several industries - on how companies have embraced and adopted essential IT trends through leveraging Cloud Foundry to realise substantial increases in profits.

About Sean Keery
Sean Keery (Pivotal) began hacking obscure video game systems at the age of 13. Sean then developed interpersonal skills while teaching snowboarding. Nowadays we've got Cloud Foundry, choreography, containers and plenty of io. Cluster deployments, IaaS independence and his studies for a Masters in Data Science keep Sean occupied. The daily commute is filled with podcasts and chipmunk bunny hops. Some family time, spicy food, a good book and wrecking the latest toys keep Sean busy at home. @zgrinch
