Description: 
	Embracing OCI and CNI Open Container Standards Between Garden & Friends - George Lestaris & Gabriel Rosenhouse, Pivotal, & Konstantinos Karampogias, Swisscom

Cloud Foundry supports a rich ecosystem of plugins and extension points at various levels of the stack. This modularity enables rapid development and deployment of new features. Garden-runC, the Linux container engine used by Cloud Foundry, adopted this kind of modular philosophy by introducing new exciting forms of extensibility in its core.

In this talk, members of three core engineering teams (Garden, GrootFS, and Container Networking) will introduce the APIs that enable pluggable filesystems and networking stacks, including support for the industry-standard Open Container Initiative (OCI) image format and the Container Networking Interface (CNI) specification. With these extension points, Cloud Foundry users and operators gain access to a rapidly-growing ecosystem of 3rd party features which can enable new use cases for the platform.
