	Gold Sponsor Lightning Talk: Let a 1000 Flowers Bloom - Dr. Michael Maximilien, IBM

Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) has never been more relevant than it is today. The release of various alternative platforms such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are proof positive that users and enterprises want an operating system for the cloud that can help them manage their containers and cloud resources. Cloud Foundry (CF) was at the forefront of PaaS and is easily the most adopted cloud platform on the market. However, it faces the classic innovator's dilemma problems that a successful leader experiences, as alternative platforms become viable. To continue to maintain its lead, we believe CF must aggressively innovate, improve, extend and embrace, so that a 1000 cloud innovative "flowers" bloom. The CF-Extensions PMC and projects are aiming at exactly that. Come hear the latest status of this new PMC and also how you can contribute your own innovative ideas to this growing garden.

About Michael (aka dr.max) Maximilien
My name is Michael Maximilien, better known as max or dr.max, and I am a computer scientist with IBM. At IBM Research Triangle Park, I was a principal engineer for the worldwide industry point-of-sale standard: JavaPOS. At IBM Research, some highlights include pioneering research on semantic Web services, mashups, and cloud computing, and platform-as-a-service. I joined the IBM Cloud Labs in 2014 and work closely with Pivotal Inc., to help make the Cloud Found the best PaaS.

all right so I'm between you and drinks

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,330
so if you have to leave you after the if

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,690
I understand

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:13,679
I would leave too so let me try to

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:19,890
convince you to stay the talk is let a

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:22,800
thousand flowers bloom so we are here in

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,050
Switzerland and obviously you guys when

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,730
you landed if you landed directly right

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:44,489
these cows and it's an interesting thing

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:56,420
because it turns out but it's also

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:58,710
problem it's a problem when so we IBM

00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,660
yeah I won't move

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,789
we IBM for instance had had multiple

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,359
cash cows and different companies have

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,420
them too

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,500
but the challenge is that you wanna find

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,729
the next Cup cow or cash cow and keep

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,930
the one that you have because it's

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,610
generating money right so you're

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,720
protecting it but typically what happens

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,630
is that people create the other one and

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,659
you lose and that's called the

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,820
innovators the the innovators dilemma so

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,040
that's my twist on it but let me give

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,890
you some examples so you guys have seen

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,640
me with cameras around and you know that

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,250
company and I can tell you they

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,740
dominated for hundreds of years

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,090
pretty much photography right but they

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,340
did it with film and it turns out Kodak

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,520
if you go back to their history you will

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,159
see that they invented this thing which

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,170
everybody now has a modern version of

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,850
called an iPhone because the iPhone is

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,360
primarily a camera with other things

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,009
attached but more importantly is if you

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,469
go to the history of Kodak you will see

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,579
that they actually had digital camera

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,759
they invented that

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,450
and where is could act today I'm not

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,630
trying to beat on them they disappeared

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:17,300
so that's what happens when you when you

00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:20,930
don't pay attention to Dino videos

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,530
dilemma storage is also another very

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,590
good example we IBM invented storage

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,270
that was like a one megabyte storage

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,810
over time Seagate and other companies

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:35,150
created one gigabyte and then over time

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,010
these things like zip drives came about

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,450
right and then now all of them

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,970
disappeared because nobody cares

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,890
everybody does SSD so if you're a

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,230
company and you were banking on zip

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,860
drive and you did not try to do the next

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,190
one

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,500
guess what you're out of business so

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,950
this problem is a common problem and I'm

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,340
citing a very famous author called

00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,140
Clayton Christensen at Harvard Business

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,850
that what about this so if you never

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,500
would that book I've read that book I

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,560
would highly recommend it that should be

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,950
one of the business books that you read

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,230
and it's it's a great book but what am I

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,630
talking this in the context of car

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,359
foundry in open source well it's because

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,760
I believe that we also face a similar

00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:22,100
issue an open source and I call it the

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,480
open source dilemma and the reason I

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,280
call it that way and I think it's

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,900
important is because more and more I

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,810
work in cloud foundry and I love it and

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,850
I'm happy to be part of the team I see

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,630
that we have this issue which is that

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:37,310
how do we keep relevant when the rest of

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,709
the world is trying to play in our game

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,260
right I'm not gonna make a lot of people

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,940
happy I'm sure my colleague here Richard

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,390
will be ok with what I'm gonna say next

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,579
but some other people want for instance

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:53,239
kubernetes is kicking our ass and some

00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:55,010
parts of it right not all of it in terms

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,799
of cloud but there are some parts of it

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,299
so how do we make Cloud Foundry more

00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,280
relevant and better and so on now

00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,989
today's announcements were great because

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,600
it's making the two products work better

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:08,269
but I would argue that we could have

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,459
been there because we were there way

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,829
before them we have probably just as

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,470
much talent and we taught about similar

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:17,570
problems and I think part of the reason

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,180
we are not there and we have some issues

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,639
is because we have this

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,009
Sudama I think and it's not just and

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,870
container management orchestration piece

00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:27,550
it's in various places now obviously

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,740
there are places that we're ahead and

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,940
we're doing quite well but the point I'm

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,340
making is let's try to not let our cash

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,220
cow prevent us from innovating okay and

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,919
the solution for this well here are

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,030
other examples so Apache struts I don't

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,729
need to say anything about that right

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,610
like you remember that one all right

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,110
Tomcat unfortunately similarly right

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,360
have experienced similar problems

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,460
meaning they are open-source projects

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,380
that have not kept up now maybe it's a

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,120
good thing maybe it's fine but I don't

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,729
want this drop into cloud foundry and I

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,169
think you guys are right so how do we

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:03,820
solve this problem so here's one example

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,680
and I'm not saying it's the only

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,680
solution there are other ways to do it I

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,720
firmly think it's about let's and

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,880
flowers grow what I mean by this is

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,620
every single one of you and everybody

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,300
else that's interested in Coventry when

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,729
they have an idea to extend it to make

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,280
it better to change it to remove the

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:23,530
guts puts another one because Cornelius

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,630
here has a great engine that he built in

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,820
Germany we should listen to him and

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,590
accept his contribution and work with

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,449
them that's what I mean by a thousand

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,240
flowers and it's a very common solution

00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:38,310
to the innovators dilemma so let's make

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:42,280
that happen by embracing extending so

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,050
good thing is and again as I said this

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,970
is one way there are maybe other ways

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,320
and this also push might be a problem

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,639
because like when you have a thousand

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,840
flowers some of them are gonna be weeds

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,120
so you know how do you get rid of them

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,620
so so there is issues here so I'm not

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,620
saying it's perfect but it's a solution

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,570
so how do you participate and solve this

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,400
because we have a solution for it is we

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,610
created this thing called CF extensions

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,009
which is a process and a PMC for any one

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,870
of you to come to me and to the other

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,669
people in a PMC and say I have an

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,729
extension spoken found you have a way to

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:14,409
do things better and I wanna be at the

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:16,870
table I want other people to know about

00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:18,759
it and so on so that's the process and

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,539
we have a way for you to participate

00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:26,470
it's pretty easy we added a project

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:29,139
where if you tag basically a topic to

00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,289
your project or repo with CF extension

00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,939
it's in a community or

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,219
or Cloud Foundry projects then it will

00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,349
automatically be added there's a list of

00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:39,300
it I don't have time to show you but you

00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:41,189
can definitely look at that of course

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,599
you can ping me there's a slack channel

00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:46,889
for it and we have multi calls so

00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:50,360
where's the proof

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:52,770
Google that came out of that right now

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,369
evidently pivotal worked with Google

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:59,699
before name they came to me in it happen

00:06:55,369 --> 00:07:01,259
and to be fair they would have done it

00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,149
no matter what so it's not like because

00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,709
they came to me okay so let's be honest

00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:06,509
about that but they order project so

00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:08,639
like like ASAP

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,729
has the service fabric that they are

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,979
submitting a pivot or submitted PBR IBM

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,779
did their backers and we're looking for

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,379
more so I just listed some of the more

00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:22,499
famous ones but there are tons more so

00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:24,419
let's keep cloud foundry relevant let's

00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:26,189
of course not fragmented and things like

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:28,559
that so I'll be I'll try to do the best

00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:31,819
I can but let's make a thousand flowers

00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:31,819
