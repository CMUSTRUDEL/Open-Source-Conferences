	How to Facilitate the Cloud Foundry Adoption with Object Storage - Denis Jannot, Dell EMC

Cloud Foundry is accelerating the adoption of micro services architecture and is impacting the way the unstructured content is accessed. An instance of a service can be started anywhere and scaled on demand, so using traditional file shares is not the solution anymore. Object storage can be accessed from anywhere and is becoming a De Facto standard for cloud native applications. But object storage can also be used to simplify the modernization of existing applications. This session provides an in-depth discussion about why object storage vs file storage and what best practices should be followed to ensure the applications will scale easily. Scalability is crucial for applications targeting the consumer market and for IoT use cases. It will be ended by a demo of a web application developed following those best practices.
