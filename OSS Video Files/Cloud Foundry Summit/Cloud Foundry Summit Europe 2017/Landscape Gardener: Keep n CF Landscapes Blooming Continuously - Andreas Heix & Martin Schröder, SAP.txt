Description: 
	Landscape Gardener: Keep n CF Landscapes Blooming Continuously - Andreas Heix & Martin Schröder, SAP

It's not an easy task to keep one CF landscape up and updated all the time. Doing this with several landscapes with varying BOMs (bill of material) on different IaaS in parallel does not make it easier. In this session, Martin and Andreas will give an overview on how they organize as a multinational, 3-time-zone team of landscape gardeners trying to keep the landscapes blooming. They will share details on the collaboration with the development organizations. Judge for yourself where this fits your idea of "DevOps" or "SRE". A larger section will be dedicated to the alerting and monitoring approach which focus on the customers' scenarios as main health indicator. Not all flowers bloom and thrive all the time –Andreas and Martin will also share some of the challenges they have with their own stuff and also with the concepts of CloudFoundry.
