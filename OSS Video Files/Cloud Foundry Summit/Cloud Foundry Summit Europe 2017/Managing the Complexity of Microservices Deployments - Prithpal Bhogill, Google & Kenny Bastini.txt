	Managing the Complexity of Microservices Deployments - Prithpal Bhogill, Google & Kenny Bastini, Pivotal

The transition to microservices can be an exciting change of pace for many developers. But for organizations, the path to success with microservices is not without embracing a major cultural shift in the process of how companies build and deliver software.

To rapidly deliver microservices to production, organizations are turning to infrastructure automation provided by a cloud-native platform, like Cloud Foundry. With a platform in place, every microservice team will have what they need to create a CI/CD pipeline that safely delivers applications to a production environment. The final ingredient for success is knowing the right patterns for connecting microservices together over HTTP using REST APIs.

In this session, Kenny Bastani from Pivotal and Prithpal Bhogill from Apigee will dive into a reference architecture that demonstrates the patterns and practices for securely connecting microservices together.

This session will cover:

- The basics for building cloud-native applications as microservices on Pivotal Cloud Foundry using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Services
- The patterns and practices that are enabling small autonomous microservice teams to provision backing services for their applications
- How to securely expose microservices over HTTP using Apigee Edge for PCF
- How to ensure that APIs are readily and securely consumable by application developers
- How to get instant, end-to-end visibility into the performance and adoption of your API program
- How to thrive in the API economy by leveraging microservices and cloud-native application architectures
