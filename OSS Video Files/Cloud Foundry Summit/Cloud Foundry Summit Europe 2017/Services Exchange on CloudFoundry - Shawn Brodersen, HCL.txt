Description: 
	Services Exchange on CloudFoundry - Shawn Brodersen, HCL

HCL has built a Services Exchange allowing CIOs to manage their hybrid cloud environments (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS capabilities). This was initially built on IBM Bluemix and HCL has ported this so as also be deployed on SAP CP CF. Understand how the benefits of portability and the Open Service Broker API helps ecosystem members maximise ROI by leveraging multi-cloud characteristics.

okay time to get started a good

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,150
afternoon good morning everyone

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,900
just a show of hands so that I

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,890
understand the audience which is massive

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,400
by the way that have to work on the

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,800
abstract for this session I think how

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,369
many people come from an SI p background

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,930
and s AP enterprise okay good okay

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,859
all right and how many people know who

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:36,809
HCL technologies are okay all right

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:40,350
so HCL Technologies is is based in Noida

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:43,469
India we are a systems integrator and

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,960
for the ASAP landscape we provide full

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,120
stack services from infrastructure

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,969
through applications to business and

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,710
innovation support management my name is

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,730
Sean Rogerson I am responsible for

00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,579
architecture innovation and product

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,660
strategy for RS ap global practice on

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,360
the global CTO and today's discussion

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,790
was going to be focused around

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,890
multi-cloud innovation I have a great

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,180
team that I work with they can't be here

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,240
today but I wanted to give him a little

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,990
shout out so to Francois Matt and Elena

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,040
that that support me rather frequently

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,220
what we want to talk about a little bit

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,130
is how we are using s IP cloud platform

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,740
and cloud foundry to bring innovations

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,960
and a multi cloud environments to to our

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,369
customers so how many people saw Tech Ed

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:41,130
I got a couple of chuckles in the

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:45,360
audience okay good good so you know s IP

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:48,329
cloud platform is a maturing platform is

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,649
IP as you heard this morning cloud

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,920
foundry is a recent tree architecture

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,049
for s IP cloud platform and it really is

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,909
a game changer for s IP and the SI p

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,240
ecosystem and what customers can do with

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,640
it

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,640
so we're we're pretty excited about it

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:10,380
now for most SI p enterprises they would

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:14,880
be familiar with the core erp components

00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:17,100
some SAS applications but building cloud

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,190
native enterprise applications at scale

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,720
in a large enterprise which has been

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,540
traditionally say an SI p first

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,390
enterprise may be a new endeavor to them

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,240
right and so when we talk to customers

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,030
around what digital transformation looks

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,400
like what innovation is we try to

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,590
simplify it into a couple of these

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,050
layers and then map some of these sa P

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,030
technologies on top of it and we'll come

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,250
to the one which you're all here to hear

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,750
about which is Cloud Foundry so if you

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,970
start with your core business at the

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,660
center you're put your logo there put

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,890
your business units and ll B's around

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,620
that you drive integrated business

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,590
processes and the in the first ring

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,140
around that then you start to define who

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,930
you are and what your behavior is at the

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,900
core of your company but the way that

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,180
people experience your company is quite

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,590
different right and that's not they

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,510
don't experience your company through an

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:18,329
ERP system and whether that values that

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,910
user value chain is consumers and

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:23,760
customers or its partners suppliers and

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,380
regulators there is a human experience

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,340
lens that you can bring to the

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,560
conversation that human experience has

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,810
to come through some kind of front-end

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,380
which has to be connected to a platform

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,930
to surface your your innovations and

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,360
that experience which has to be

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,070
connected through to a digital thread to

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,100
bring all of the siloed pieces of

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:51,500
information and IT OT PT across an

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:55,320
organization into into the platform and

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:59,280
and ultimately then into your core so

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,190
what s IP offers is a cortege suite of

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,780
products and solutions that accommodate

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,120
this with the newest offering really

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,620
being cloud platform and the innovations

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,900
that are on that and how many people

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:15,670
have heard of Leonardo ok couple so

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,380
Leonardo is a brand

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,000
sits on top of cloud platform and that's

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,620
where the innovations from SAT around

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:30,310
MLA I blockchain and and others are

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:33,850
delivered so why is why is Cloud Foundry

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:36,250
a game-changer for s ap you heard from

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:41,590
mark Dale this morning around what s IP

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:45,490
strategy is for multi cloud for for open

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:48,400
source and for an ecosystem and this is

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,280
really a huge differentiator for us ap

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,729
versus its competitors and is a very

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:59,080
interesting conversation for large

00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:00,580
enterprises which ties nicely into this

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,260
morning's conversation around what

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,320
adoption looks like a large enterprise

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:08,650
small enterprise small business so s AP

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,690
cloud platform is available on Shore

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,750
it's available on IDs it's available on

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,780
GC P and then s AP offers it as well so

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,780
it is truly a multi cloud distribution

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,780
model

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,610
and the benefits of that model really is

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,039
that in addition to the obvious

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:37,490
technical capabilities in of cloud

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,800
foundry for an enterprise it means that

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,199
now you can take the worlds of Si P in

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,080
the worlds of non si P and create a a

00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:49,060
good bit of scale across your internal

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:53,030
IT departments so what do I mean by that

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:55,400
common platforms common runtimes common

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,280
languages common ways of working common

00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:02,080
tool chains viola intimate DevOps

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,460
together across both si si and non-si P

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,590
landscapes the ability to select the

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,520
best cloud for the best the best

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:13,310
workload these are all choices now that

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,870
we didn't have before and is terribly

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,630
exciting from an SI p perspective

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,080
driving forward to deliver innovations

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,940
in a cloud native enterprise application

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,680
its frequent that when we speak with our

00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,810
customers we're speaking to them not

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,340
only about a safety cloud platform but

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,319
about cloud foundry and then call it

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,590
foundry on any cloud rights whether that

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,949
is a distribution that sa p SC P

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:39,020
supports or it is a different commercial

00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,419
distribution could be pivotal could be

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,969
bluemix might be the native Azure

00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,500
distribution could be something on prem

00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:48,860
so whether it's multi cloud or hybrid

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,139
multi cloud its choice that customers

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,770
are asking for and choice that customers

00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:56,750
expect in the enterprise deployment so

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,090
we wouldn't say or suggest that SI p

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,219
cloud platform is the right platform to

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,169
develop and deliver every single

00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:05,900
application in enterprise but it is a

00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:08,180
platform that drives a lot of benefits

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,460
and a lot of value anytime that you're

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,380
connected into the enterprise core if

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,250
you're processing a business transaction

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:18,349
why because s IP is you know effectively

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,240
the world's best-known data dictionary

00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:22,219
it's the strongest transaction

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,740
processing engine in the world it's

00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:27,190
extremely extensible and has been for

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,990
years inside a core monolithic

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,699
application architecture and now SCP

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,699
allows you to abstract that and to

00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:37,089
create cloud native extensions and

00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,739
that's ultimately what we're all

00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,689
excited about and what we're all

00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:42,969
building towards is these these purple

00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:45,279
blocks on either side of the cloud

00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:48,399
building interference centric

00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,469
intelligent applications and extensions

00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,209
for the enterprise there's several

00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:54,419
different use cases that we apply this

00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:56,529
to when we're talking to enterprise

00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,929
customers is that they can understand

00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:01,629
well what does this mean in the world of

00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:04,779
s IP what does this mean to my heritage

00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:07,649
applications so this is a little bit of

00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:14,499
a busy diagram the next one's even worse

00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:18,669
but this describes several different use

00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:20,259
cases that we present as cp4 so if you

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:24,279
start in the bottom left with the blue

00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:26,019
box that says sa P then it goes up to

00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,149
another blue box and comes back right

00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:30,249
this is the you know with the

00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:32,019
announcement as an example of a bob as a

00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:33,610
build pack on called platform this is

00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:37,360
the ability to create a bob

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,339
extensibility to s ap score on cloud

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,139
platform delivering enhancements and

00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,610
minor applications that you otherwise

00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:44,709
would have traditionally built in the

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,410
core this helps facilitate a little bit

00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:49,629
more of a bimodal to speed IT both in

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,779
that you're simplifying the core as well

00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:54,490
as you know using new new build methods

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,370
out in the cloud platform

00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:00,730
if you move along the bottom row into

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:03,970
the fuchsia looking boxes there's a

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:06,160
couple of additional examples here okay

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,649
so the ones that are low lighted is the

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,569
opportunity to fully replay form and

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,269
refactor those applications and run them

00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:14,879
directly on s IP cloud platform for with

00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:18,759
the you know with the Cloud Foundry

00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,620
Edition and then once you have replay

00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,240
form and refactored those some of those

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,129
micro services which you may have

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,259
refactored them into obviously become

00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:29,110
extensible across the entire enterprise

00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:31,569
ecosystem so they can be repackaged and

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,649
reused as business services and consumed

00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:38,259
across many applications mobile or web

00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:42,009
for any business unit or any use case

00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:44,050
and moving further to the writes the

00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:47,079
same idea of extensibility around

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,720
heritage applications can be executed as

00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:50,280
well on cloud platform so take

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,770
functionality in making it available

00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,660
across many heritage applications or

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,750
heritage and s AP applications together

00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:01,020
and and delivering that through the same

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,360
mechanism and then obviously the ability

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,890
to create new out of the fresh

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,440
out-of-the-box cloud native enterprise

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:10,860
applications and deliver those connected

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,470
into sa P where SCP is facilitating not

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,270
only the the net new build but also the

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,890
orchestration integration is a key

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:23,100
component an SCP is more than just Cloud

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:28,010
Foundry as most commercial distributions

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:31,410
are it has its own set of services and

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:33,780
templates accelerators innovation PACs

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,970
etc and so this kind of gives you a view

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,730
of well how does those different use

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:42,750
cases fit into that broader ecosystem by

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,130
adopting SCP for for your experience

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,350
centric intelligent applications and

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,110
extensions so you can see here low

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,970
lighted in grey things like Leonardo IOT

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,990
for connecting the asset value chain

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:56,910
Leonardo MLI I for for bringing

00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,550
intelligence and cognitive capabilities

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:02,700
natural language processing etc and then

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,020
experience or services to address the

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,170
different constituents which an

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,950
enterprise needs to consider as well as

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:16,080
the key orchestration layer and

00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:18,540
analytics components what we found is

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,240
that in order for an organization to go

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,580
through any of this activity it's not

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,050
just it's not just about bringing a

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,610
technical discussion to them for the

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,290
platform it's about understanding and

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,810
explaining what the business benefit is

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,810
and that that requires a cultural change

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,730
for them so as much as s IP is known for

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,050
business transformations now with the

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,720
introduction of a platform like this

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,040
you're also looking at IT

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,860
transformations and I think you know one

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,160
of the one of the hottest trending now

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,500
topics today with SAV enterprises is you

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,510
know can I run DevOps in mysap shop can

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,640
I be agile what does that look like and

00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,450
how does something like a cloud platform

00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,450
and accelerate that

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,230
so one by head towards the the back half

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,140
of the presentation with examples of

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,320
what what does this mean to HCl so HCl

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:12,760
largely provides services to two

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,790
enterprises as was described earlier but

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:19,980
we also have a strategy for building

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:22,180
platforms and products and so for us the

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,810
the cloud foundry and the AP cloud

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,640
platform approach means portability it

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,130
means scale it means reduce complexity

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,620
for our IP so that we can deploy that

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,530
across commercial platforms as part of

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:38,230
that mode three strategy so we do work

00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:40,180
with bluemix and with pivotal as well as

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,180
SME cloud platform obviously SCPs

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,790
adoption of CF is relatively as

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,170
relatively new and so we have a

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,650
tremendous amount of experience with

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:52,270
bluemix and pivotal and what we wanted

00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,700
to do was take the products and the IP

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,380
that we had been working on in those

00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,600
platforms and be able to bring it to s

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:03,370
IP customers so I'll show you just two

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:06,760
examples of where we're doing that in

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,670
the next couple of slides so the first

00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:15,370
is our dry ice framework for autonomics

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:18,180
and product that's called xsm and what

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:22,750
this is is a service management suite

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,790
that allows you to create and facilitate

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,890
basically any service management process

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,590
so it started with the I with the notion

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:32,110
of basically a set of a set of micro

00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:35,290
services a set of micro services which

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:37,300
would facilitate in ITSM kind of process

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,130
but actually through the abstraction

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,990
process to create micro services what

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,700
you find out is that you know these

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,680
things apply to basically any service

00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,300
management case and when with our

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,130
customers and large enterprises looking

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,530
to you know transition to basically

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,060
anything as a service right these micro

00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,340
services has become relevance to

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,960
facilitating the net new build of

00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,930
applications to help them with those

00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,750
transitions task management assignment

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,630
management service level management

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,100
approvals notification management these

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,869
are all

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,579
abstracted business services that are

00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:11,929
applied to basically any service

00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:15,290
management case whether we're talking

00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:18,499
about field services depo scenario where

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,790
you return something or or in fact as it

00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:25,160
was originally intended

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:26,480
ITSM use cases so we've taken the these

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,160
micro services which were originally

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,920
built on bluemix and imported them to s

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,989
IP cloud platform as part of our as part

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,309
of our journey for this particular

00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:42,160
product the second example that i wanted

00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:44,809
to talk about a little bit was

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,699
blockchain applications and micro

00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:50,389
services that we built on a platform

00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:52,670
called HCL's code trust so in this

00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,929
illustration you can see and for those

00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,699
of you that were at Tech Ed you're

00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:57,049
familiar with si PS announcement around

00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:59,269
blockchain services and their

00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:02,689
availability again through s IP cloud

00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:06,499
platform what underlies that's today is

00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:08,110
is hyper ledger fabric and it's the long

00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:11,449
term intention obviously is to be

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,879
blockchain engine agnostic but today

00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:15,679
that's where they've started and on top

00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,059
of cloud platform s IP offers blockchain

00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,860
services and on top of that they will

00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:20,929
offer their own application services for

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,240
things like track and trace and industry

00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:25,339
specific extensions but you know in the

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,339
SAV ecosystem and for the SAV platform

00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:30,470
in general they're encouraging you know

00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:32,749
obviously strong ecosystem adoption and

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,899
partner investment and so HCl has been

00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:39,139
doing some work outside of cloud

00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:42,410
platform with as it turns out with

00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:44,089
bluemix and with us I be M's Harbor

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,160
ledger fabric as well and you can see

00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:48,679
that in the dotted line the non si Pico

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,990
trust architecture and services but

00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,499
because we built those using cloud

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,529
foundry

00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:56,540
and in common components we were able to

00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:59,059
quickly ports those same micro services

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,709
over to the s ap cloud platform to help

00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:03,350
enable rapid building of enterprise

00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:05,959
applications at scale for blockchain

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,179
based use cases and that's what the

00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,980
little blocks represent at that at the

00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:11,959
top again is these experience centric

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,209
intelligent applications which take

00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:17,609
advantage of the underlying services and

00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:20,339
and the ability to access those from the

00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:23,459
platform and here's an example of some

00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:25,019
of the different use cases that we're

00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:27,919
working on with customers and the way

00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:31,639
that that manifests itself on the

00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,639
application platform itself

00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:40,790
and so the last topic that I was asked

00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:44,360
to speak about today was you know what's

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,899
the impact of open service broker API to

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:51,199
our strategy as it relates to both

00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:54,050
customers as well as HCL's own IP and

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,360
for me it means cross-platform service

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,939
ecosystem a broad across platform

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,720
service echo system as sort of the Holy

00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:04,490
Grail so I'd like to sit in here and say

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,260
that's my team had no problem at all

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,329
porting micro services that were built

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,059
from bluemix to us ap cloud platform it

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:13,730
was you know seamless and happened in a

00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:16,699
matter of hours right the truth is is

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,919
that some went fairly smoothly and

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,839
others didn't go so smoothly at all

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,579
essentially we had to re-engineer the

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,100
entire micro service because the backing

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,799
services that were available or consumed

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,929
from IBM as an example were not

00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,000
available through s ap cloud platform

00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:34,190
nor were they available through a

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,750
service broker where we could go from

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,380
one cloud to consume another clouds

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:43,549
providing and provisioning services so

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:46,490
ultimately in order to achieve this

00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:48,440
vision of HCl building products and

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,260
having those products and services that

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,510
IP available across any platform and

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:59,059
delivered on any cloud that the customer

00:17:53,510 --> 00:18:01,240
chooses the open service the open

00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:04,700
service broker API really needs to

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,870
mature and see broad adoption and I

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,260
think that's where we're really looking

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:11,390
to generate strong community and an

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,760
ecosystem to drive adoption and scale

00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:20,059
across all of these platforms and

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:21,940
services and that is my brief

00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,809
presentation happy to take questions

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,929
finished a little bit faster than I

00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:29,110
thought I'd liked I usually talk quite a

00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:29,110
bit

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,490
awkward pause yes

00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,710
if the reason this is important is

00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,990
because customers have already started

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,180
their digital journey right I mean we

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,100
deal with a lot of you know large

00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,780
enterprises even small enterprises that

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,780
started to build applications or consume

00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,980
services from image or or an AWS or at

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,600
Google and they have their favorites

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:18,760
right and so the important component

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,930
here to have a conversation around us I

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,490
think cloud platform is to say well

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,170
that's not a limitation rights in a

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,090
multi cloud environment you can choose

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,860
in the my presentation we've been

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,780
probably perfect before the Microsoft

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,460
guy before me because he takes what I'm

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,290
talking about in a generic sense and

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:37,390
saying here's actually how that works

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:39,070
with Azure and SCP right and so that is

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,560
the that is the perfect use case if your

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:44,020
as your fan if you're a GC fan no

00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:47,050
problem you can you can have SCP in that

00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,640
is stack and using service broker you

00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,550
can access you know some of those

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,660
services that that you that you're

00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,030
interested in because that's why you

00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,350
selected the cloud platform in the first

00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,600
place and that particular cloud provider

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:02,110
so we don't see it as a limitation it's

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:06,160
a it's a big differentiator from from my

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:08,110
perspective that I can go into to any

00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,780
enterprise and basically have an answer

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:13,960
for them around deployment of SAV cloud

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,670
platform and then above that in terms of

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,460
what I you know what we provide which

00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:21,010
was you know this conversation here it's

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:24,580
the ability to deliver IP through micro

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:26,230
applications basically to any commercial

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,990
deployment and be able to consume

00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,360
innovation services when and where they

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,330
make sense right so I don't think any of

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,100
us believe that any one vendor in the

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,810
ecosystem has all the answers right

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,000
that's what the community is about but

00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:42,850
still everybody has a commercial

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,420
interest and and so how do you consume

00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:49,090
meter and and Bill for those innovation

00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:55,290
services that's where the broker API is

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:55,290
going to be critical that make sense

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,899
yes sir that's a that's a good question

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:23,580
so we do not in this model we don't run

00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:25,770
our own cloud we're using somebody

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,799
else's cloud so we're not we don't own

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,750
the data or hold the data and really it

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,360
depends on in terms of where the data is

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,210
stored it depends on which cloud you

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,590
have selected right so if I'm creating

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:42,179
persistent data in the cloud it's stored

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:43,799
on one of those IAS providers when it's

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,690
integrated back to an ERP there are

00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:49,470
cases where what we're building for

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,730
customers on Cloud Foundry is basically

00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,140
shuttling data in and out of an

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,480
application and there's really no

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,610
long-term data storage or persistence it

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,590
goes back into the ERP core in which

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:03,240
case the data is not stored there data

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:06,450
is always owned and I've not come across

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,490
a case yet where we have built a

00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,770
solution where the data is no longer

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:13,860
owned by our end customer right the

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:16,049
large enterprise it's the it's the

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,080
customers data and the product that we

00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:20,429
build for them is their product you know

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,960
there's there are services out there

00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:23,789
like if you look at like what GE

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,159
predicts is doing rights as an example

00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:27,870
where they provide which is freedoms

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,510
also a Cloud Foundry based solution

00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,799
where they have agreements that the data

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,720
which is captured and brought into the

00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:36,360
platform through you know devices and

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,789
machine data acquisition becomes GE data

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,049
and then you have to you know buy or

00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:42,480
lease it back and these kinds of things

00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:47,279
but that we're not we're not deploying

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,840
any of those models today I think the

00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,230
other challenge is obviously the the

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,929
building and the in the and the the use

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,909
the consumption monitoring so in any of

00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:59,220
the micro services that we build we've

00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:01,200
started to include abacus feature and

00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,940
each one of those so that we have the

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,980
opportunity to you know to monitor and

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:10,309
monetize consumption it was a good

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,309
question

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,240
good anyone else

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,289
all right well thanks for your time

00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:22,740
appreciate it you have a good day enjoy

00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:25,950
the show

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,950
