	An IoT App's Journey to the Cloud: From localhost to PCF Dev and Pivotal Cloud Foundry - Beibei Yang, Dell EMC

Modern factories have implemented a multitude of IoT devices generating streaming data with different formats and capacity.

We will discuss some of the challenges we ran into and how to address them.
