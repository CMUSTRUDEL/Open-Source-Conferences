got some people coming in guten Magan

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:15,049
Bonjour I had to use all of them

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:17,250
welcome to Cloud Foundry Basel edition

00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:20,039
thank each and every one of you for

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,170
being here we're so excited to be in

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:28,529
Switzerland this year and hang out with

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:30,150
all of you here so thank you before we

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,000
start today I have to give a shout out

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,780
to all of our amazing sponsors that make

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,780
this possible pivotal and s AP and

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,649
Swisscom thank you for allowing us to

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,899
have this event space the food and an

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:52,920
opportunity to bring everyone close

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:55,440
together today I'm going to talk about

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,160
Cloud Foundry the momentum in our

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,949
community and some big announcements we

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,589
have coming up but first I wanted to ask

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,589
each and every one of you to think big

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:15,659
in the 1800s Baron's had the idea to

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,820
fundamentally change logistics and

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,110
transportation in the Transcontinental

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,810
United States but it wasn't their idea

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,090
that made that happen

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,170
it was the thousands of creators the

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,340
engineers the architects that

00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,990
fundamentally changed the landscape of

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:40,500
the United States we're a little bit

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,070
later in the early 1900s when an

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,450
architect had the idea to build a bridge

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:49,170
connecting Marin County with San

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,420
Francisco and helping people that were

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,369
previously coming only by boat to be

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,390
able to drive and connecting those two

00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:00,149
cities while an architect had the idea

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:04,049
it was the thousands of creators

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,119
engineers architects that made that

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,479
possible

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,280
it was those creators that made the Bay

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,860
Bridge are the sorry the Golden Gate

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,190
Bridge one of the modern marvels

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:21,540
of the world it is today so you see

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:26,040
where I'm going with this mistake it's

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,290
been more recent past a 2007 the iPhone

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,210
came out and that was really cool and

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,740
really interesting and it was fun you

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,760
could take photos you could text but

00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,640
that's not what made it really

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,180
interesting it was 2008 when the App

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,010
Store came out and these applications

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,280
that were written by the thousands of

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,920
developers fundamentally changed the

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,239
role the smartphone played how many of

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:59,190
you here have a smartphone right

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,910
how many have two exactly today I would

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:05,580
rather lose my wallet than lose my phone

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:08,070
good with my phone I can check in for my

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,709
flight I can find the next bus the next

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,600
rain I can order food I can order

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,500
groceries I can do everything on that I

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,340
can pay bills

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,680
I do everything on my phone and that's

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,860
because of those developers to created

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,810
those apps those applications have

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,970
fundamentally turned the platform into

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,890
the invaluable technology that it is to

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:34,019
each and every one of us today so I'd

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,480
like to posit that developers are the

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,340
heroes of this story

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,630
it's the developers each and every one

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,560
of you that are fundamentally changing

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,000
the role technology plays it's fun

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,739
delete changing each and every one of

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,530
your organization's we often call it

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,450
digital transformation and I know that

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,570
we've used this word a lot and some of

00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,390
us are probably sick of hearing about it

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:03,420
but it doesn't change the fact each and

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:06,750
every organization are finding ways to

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:12,720
be more innovative be more responsive to

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:14,579
customers fail faster they're asking

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,579
their organizations to be more

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:21,870
innovative leveraging software to change

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,400
the entire business one of my favorite

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,950
examples that are representative of

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,560
digital transformation is the banking

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,570
industry

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,340
and I like this one because it is the

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,700
most tangible and it impacts each and

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,020
every one of us every day five years ago

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,639
if you told me I would be doing a

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,720
hundred percent of my banking on my

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,760
phone I would have laughed but yet here

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,110
we are I do all of my banking on my

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,150
phone I deposit checks transfer money

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:53,230
send money to friends pay bills I do all

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:56,290
of that on my phone and that's possible

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,070
because my bank wrote an app that sits

00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,000
on my phone

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:03,520
and that small application represents so

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,330
much more because it changes the way

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,950
that I engage with my bank and it

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,169
changes the way my bank thinks about

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,790
technology because that software

00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:16,810
represents a way for them to be

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:18,940
connected to me in new ways but it also

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,870
represents a fundamental change in that

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:25,360
Bank you don't just put an app on the

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,880
phone and let it sit you're just you're

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,290
not how often do we update them

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,810
sometimes every month sometimes every

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:35,340
week there's constant updates to

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:38,350
applications until that small app also

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,380
represents my bank investing in

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:44,830
continuous delivery practices agile

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,260
practices they're adding in a feedback

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,630
loop with me as a customer how do they

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,669
iterate on that application so that

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,430
small app represents a fundamental

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:58,080
change for my organization my bank's

00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:01,720
organization and many that are like that

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,630
for my bank it's an opportunity for them

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,720
to rethink how code is written deployed

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:12,570
and iterated and continuously changed

00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,950
over time but it also represents a way

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:19,570
for them to rethink how systems are

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:25,090
managed secured and then scaled as these

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:26,770
applications gain and usage each of

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,100
these organizations that are leveraging

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:33,190
software new ways want to give their

00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,419
developers that freedom to create to

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,000
give each and every one of you they

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,620
opportunity to get an idea and get it

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,710
out into the market as quickly as

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,710
possible

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:50,290
so earlier this year in June at the last

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,850
summit we announced that Kubo had been

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:55,510
formally donated to the Cloud Foundry

00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:58,000
foundation by Google and pivotal as a

00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:01,390
refresher Kubo is kubernetes on Bosch

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,850
and it combines those two amazing

00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:06,070
technologies to bring together the

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:10,240
opportunity to run your applications and

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:13,150
containerized workloads in new ways well

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:18,370
today I want to announce that we're

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:22,000
renaming that Kubo is now going to be

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,890
known as a container run time the

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,720
container run time offers you the

00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:29,530
opportunity to run those containerized

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:33,070
workloads within cloud foundry but more

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:37,240
importantly run them alongside what was

00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:39,520
formerly the elastic runtime and is now

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,530
going to be known as application run

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:47,940
time so running those two container run

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:50,890
time and application run time in tandem

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,830
supported by Bosh as part of the open

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:56,650
source cloud foundry this allows you to

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,510
leverage Cloud Foundry but still have

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,680
the opportunity to have the right tool

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,680
for the right job

00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:07,840
so as we think about giving developers

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,580
that freedom to create and giving

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,370
developers the opportunity to take an

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,460
idea and get that to market as quickly

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:18,100
as possible that's where we come up with

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,500
run time and now you have the

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:25,320
opportunity to use the right tool for

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,320
the right job all within cloud foundry

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:32,620
but the coolest thing about cloud

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,469
foundry is that it's open source we're

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,750
here at an open source conference and

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,210
what does that mean open source means

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,010
that we're able to bring together

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:48,150
diverse people from diverse

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:48,150
organizations to drive real innovation

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,740
and I want to take a minute to step back

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:58,360
and really talk about what that means

00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,160
me diversity is important diversity and

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,500
inclusivity are important in an

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,500
open-source community because it's

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,600
important to hear every voice from

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,860
everyone in the community but more

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,880
importantly that's where the innovation

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,279
happens we cannot innovate and truly

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,020
Drive the best of breed technology

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,200
without having every voice around the

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,000
table so as we think about the potential

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,279
we have both as an open-source

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,100
technology but as the Cloud Foundry

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:30,700
community we have the potential to allow

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,440
many voices to be heard to really make

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:38,740
sure that Cloud Foundry is the Best of

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:41,890
Breed technology so we bring together

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,899
the runtime the container runtime the

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,450
application runtime to allow the

00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:48,000
developers to take an idea to market as

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,860
quickly as possible

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,630
combine that with open source the

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:57,970
opportunity to bring together diverse

00:09:52,630 --> 00:10:03,040
minds to drive real innovation together

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:05,290
we get Cloud Foundry I'm a transition

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,610
here for a little bit to talk about our

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:12,310
users we just completed a user survey a

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:16,260
few weeks ago and I'm so thrilled to say

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:19,300
that we had nearly 800 users respond and

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,589
that survey represents more than just an

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,839
opportunity to talk about all the

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,970
amazing work you're doing as users but

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,690
it also gives us as a community insight

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,670
into what people use Cloud Foundry for

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,079
what's valuable what are the importance

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:38,680
of it and what are we gonna do with it

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:40,060
next so I grabbed a few snaps of some of

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,670
those results and I wanted to share them

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,670
with you today who uses Cloud Foundry

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,920
well

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:53,620
49% are large enterprises which is not

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,839
surprising but what was also exciting

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,529
was to see that 39% of users are small

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,070
and medium businesses so there's power

00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:04,839
and Cloud Foundry to hit every

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:07,120
organization and enabling every

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:12,550
organization to have that

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:15,520
platform for developers we've also seen

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:20,320
a significant change in the community

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:22,980
this year and we've seen a lot of new

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,320
users come in a lot of new use cases

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,960
we've also seen based on the survey that

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,089
45% of users that responded to the

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,650
survey have only been using Cloud

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:36,970
Foundry in the last year so this is

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,370
exciting because it really represents

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,380
that not only do we have so many new

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,570
users and so many new people that are

00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,930
participating in this community we have

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:53,970
so much more potential and the future is

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:55,870
looking really bright one of the last

00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,630
data points that I thought were really

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,700
interesting where what I as is people

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,110
were running Cloud Foundry on what

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,890
infrastructure did they use to take

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:09,960
advantage of the power of cloud foundry

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:13,330
what we found over half our multi cloud

00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:16,810
over half of the users are leveraging

00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:19,990
Cloud Foundry both on Prem and across

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,850
public clouds and so as we think about

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,400
the power of cloud foundry and we think

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,459
about the enablement it gives you that

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:33,029
flexibility that opportunity to run your

00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:41,140
workloads on any cloud both on Prem and

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:44,589
public today over half the Fortune 500

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,300
are running Cloud Foundry and I wanted

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:49,420
to call out a couple of use cases

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,900
because I really want to do showcase the

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:58,060
amazing power of cloud foundry but also

00:12:51,900 --> 00:13:04,839
how it's changing organizations first up

00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:06,640
is Volkswagen and Volkswagen has done a

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,070
lot in terms of taking the technology

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,839
they have a hybrid cloud infrastructure

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,610
they're running both pivotal Cloud

00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,510
Foundry as well as the open source Cloud

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:19,030
Foundry across from multiple clouds for

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,329
them it represents an opportunity to be

00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,220
more responsive to customer

00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:28,180
provide easy access to multiple cloud

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:31,119
providers and finally give a consistent

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:36,759
access to all of their brands to a

00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:39,100
single platform to use their own words

00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,649
Cloud Foundry ables us to combine our

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,069
internal on-prem cloud with several

00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:46,389
external cloud providers the beauty is

00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:49,240
that we can move workloads between

00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:52,360
providers and for the developer it's

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,329
always the same same platform same

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,519
methodology the same environment and

00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:59,490
that's where the power of cloud foundry

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:06,309
sits is providing that consistency

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:09,999
across any cloud another use case I want

00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:15,160
to highlight is Home Depot Home Depot is

00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:16,600
a home improvement store and it's not

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,170
the first place you would think of when

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,179
you think about cloud native and

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,089
innovation around the cloud but yet in

00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:27,429
the last couple of years Home Depot has

00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:29,740
gone from zero developers working on

00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:32,040
Cloud Foundry to over 2,500 developers

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,600
that are writing code on cloud foundry

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,899
with over 2,000 applications in

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,679
production today alone the momentum is

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:45,040
strong their platform can now handle

00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,230
over 2 billion service calls a month but

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,790
most importantly they took their

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:56,259
application deployment from 6 weeks on

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,999
average to 6 hours for them it

00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:00,579
fundamentally represented a new way to

00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:02,439
work and a new way to write code and

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:08,740
leverage that code across their

00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:10,749
organization Cloud Foundry gives us

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,439
control over the way we deploy and scale

00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:16,449
our applications and isn't that what you

00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:18,100
want out of a platform something that

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:22,079
allows you to write code get it out

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,079
there quickly and scale that effectively

00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:32,320
now we're here and it's been a year

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,520
since we were in Europe last time I want

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,070
to talk a little bit about our community

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:42,600
growth we've had five new members join

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,600
just in the last month

00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:48,880
American Airlines Home Depot Volkswagen

00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,220
but also influx CB and comm Sisto we're

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:56,380
seeing a huge growth in diversity and

00:15:51,220 --> 00:16:00,280
our community in our membership at

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,230
nearly 70 members one of the most

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,450
interesting things is that end-users

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:08,590
represent 40% of our membership base now

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,570
so what that means is we think about

00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:13,030
digital transformation and the power of

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,470
open source is more and more companies

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,170
are not only wanting to leverage

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,100
software and become software companies

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,100
but they're also wanting to participate

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,530
in open source so the power of open

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:30,700
source is also helping change these

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:32,500
companies one at a time also in our

00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:36,610
community we've seen a tremendous amount

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,530
of velocity we are still one of the

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,980
largest highest velocity open source

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:46,060
projects and continue to grow in terms

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:48,430
of contributors lines of code but even

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:54,310
repos because this is a large and

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:56,160
complex project we've also seen the self

00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:59,710
organized groups grow around the world

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:03,610
at over 200 groups with over 70,000

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:05,560
members there's a meet-up near you this

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,620
is an opportunity for more people to

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,360
share ideas and collaborate but also an

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:15,370
opportunity to make this a grassroots

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:19,930
movement as well so now on to some

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:22,959
announcements the first one is the

00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:26,949
foundry this is live as of this morning

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,560
the foundry represents an opportunity to

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:33,270
pull together all of the services and

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:36,060
the capabilities inside the ecosystem

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:38,250
this is where you can find

00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,310
someone to help on integration a

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,890
training partner or the many services

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:47,720
that are available in and around Cloud

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:50,970
Foundry we're starting off with just 600

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,620
we're seeing that scale is more and more

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,920
services are available within our

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,140
community and for users this is awkward

00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,990
offers you in singular opportunity and

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,660
one place to go and find out how you can

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:08,910
get support help or grow your Cloud

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,470
Foundry deployment also in June of this

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,570
year we formally launched the Cloud

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,960
Foundry certified developer training

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:19,430
program and I'm proud to say that since

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,290
June we've had nearly 10,000 enroll

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,150
10,000 people have signed up to take

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,760
either the massive open online training

00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:31,080
course the startup the self-paced

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,700
training and the certification this is

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,890
such an exciting momentum and it was

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,630
something that was a long time coming

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,360
and we're super proud to see so many

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,670
people wanting to participate and take

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:51,510
advantage of and build out their Cloud

00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:56,130
Foundry knowledge in other news Fujitsu

00:18:51,510 --> 00:19:00,450
is the latest certified provider k5 is

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:02,550
Fujitsu Cloud Foundry distribution which

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:05,760
brings us to seven certified

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:09,200
distributions of Cloud Foundry with Atos

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,150
pivotal huawei IBM Swisscom si P and now

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,520
Fujitsu there's a commercial Cloud

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:20,910
Foundry distribution everywhere in the

00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:23,510
world this represents an opportunity to

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:26,370
make sure that we are able to provide

00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,930
Cloud Foundry consistently so when we

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,210
say certified distribution what that

00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:33,210
means is when you leverage a Cloud

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,980
Foundry distribution you can be assured

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:39,320
that there is a consistency to that

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,320
