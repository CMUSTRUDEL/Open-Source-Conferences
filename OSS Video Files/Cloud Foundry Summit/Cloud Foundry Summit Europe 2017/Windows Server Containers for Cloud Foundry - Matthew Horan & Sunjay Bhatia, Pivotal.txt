	Windows Server Containers for Cloud Foundry - Matthew Horan & Sunjay Bhatia, Pivotal

The Garden Windows team has been working hard to bring Windows Server Containers to Cloud Foundry. We'll be providing an update on our progress in implementing Windows Server Containers support, and discuss the architecture of this implementation. We'll assess the new file-system and network isolation provided by Windows Server Containers, and cover some of the differences between Windows Server 2012R2 "containers" and the Windows Server Containers offered in Windows Server 2016. We'll also touch on the concept of HyperV isolation, which is new in Windows Server 2016.
