About Mark Thienpont
Based on a solid and in-depth knowledge of SAP-BW/BO and SAP-HANA, combined with experience in organizations, project-handling, and business-processes, and an eagerness to continuously learn, I combine technical advice and implementation work with training (internal or external), and various exploration and discovery activities in context of Business Intelligence/Analytics.
SAP's strategic roadmap concerning its HANA-platform, enabling advanced embedded analytics on BigData scale, and S/4 as premium ERP offer, keeps on inspiring me to bring functional business IT to a next level. I also strongly believe that the current evolution on artificial intelligence will drive this evolution even more.
