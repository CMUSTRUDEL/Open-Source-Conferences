Description: 
	Building Resilient Microservices with .NET Core and Steeltoe - Zach Brown & Matt Horan, Pivotal

The cloud encourages a set of design principles that, at first, may seem a little foreign to .NET developers. There are 12-factor apps, microservices, and patterns like service discovery, shared config management, and circuit breakers.

To make their apps run and scale well on Cloud Foundry, developers need to explicitly declare all dependencies, externalize configuration, store session state out of process, and avoid accessing the registry, the GAC, or the local file system.

This session is for developers and architects who want to leverage cloud-native architectures with their .NET apps on Cloud Foundry. The speakers will demonstrate cloud-native development patterns using .NET Core and Steeltoe (https://steeltoe.io), a new project aimed at cloud-native .NET.

About Zach Brown
Zach Brown starting building web sites in the 90s using Netscape-optimized HTML, cgi, and lots of Photoshop lens flares. He spent many years as an enterprise software developer in the Microsoft ecosystem, and now works at Pivotal in San Francisco as a customer-facing Product Owner for Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Steeltoe.

About Matthew Horan
Matthew Horan has spent over a decade developing Web applications. Before becoming a developer, he worked as a systems administrator at various startups and hosting providers. Having worked with just about every configuration management tool, and being a developer by trade, he was naturally drawn to Cloud Foundry. He has focused on .NET due to a desire to bring the best practices of Pivotal's Cloud Foundry platform to a wider audience.
