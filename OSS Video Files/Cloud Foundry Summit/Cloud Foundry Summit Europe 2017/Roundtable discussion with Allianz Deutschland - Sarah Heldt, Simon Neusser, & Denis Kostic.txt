About Sarah Heldt
A product owner who has experienced digitalisation in three different industries: media, telecommunication, and finance. Mega trends as the accelerating technological change and mobile internet demand enterprises to be as fast and flexible as start-ups when developing customer centric products. My purpose is to help companies to leverage a team's potential, build useful and easy to use services and products, and to create fulfilling career paths as part of their digital transformation because I believe it takes passionate employees to master the challenges of the Silicon Age.
