	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,990
my name is Matias Tina and I'm part of

00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:07,140
strategy and product management for our

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,210
cloud platform and I was co-chair

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,590
together with Julian Fischer from any

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,330
nines and when we started talking to the

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,090
foundation about this track and what we

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,800
want to cover here primarily we had lots

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,210
of conversation originally we thought it

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,250
would also be a good title to call the

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,050
cloud family in the enterprise but

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,779
apparently that name has been taken by

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,490
the customer success story so we said ok

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,800
let's go for something else which is

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,690
broad in scope because we have a quite

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,660
diverse range of topics and speakers

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:41,670
here when we we went with Cloud Foundry

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:44,309
at scale and Julian really and me we

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,800
wanted to keep this authentic and honest

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,930
yes it's a sponsor track but the model

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,420
submissions we got we said you're gonna

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,250
focus on those that can rightfully claim

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,170
to be the most important ones for you so

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,149
on behalf of SFP I definitely want to

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,670
say this you will see no product which

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,250
is nothing of that sort of nature but

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:10,049
it's all about knowledge sharing and you

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,150
know giving back to the community if

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,799
that's add so this track is kind of

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,530
going into the same direction as the

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,630
famous cloud maturity model basically

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,030
implying that there are different levels

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,189
of excellence right which you go through

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,200
in order to master cloud and I think

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,020
that's also true in running Cloud

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,880
Foundry at at scale when it comes to

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,270
large distributed systems and so forth

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,479
so the idea is there's always a next

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,030
level you can achieve so let's talk

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,650
about what it takes to get to the next

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,070
level and what some of the experiences

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,570
people made when they go there and

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,299
basically I want to really keep this

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,159
short and just let the session speak for

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,759
themselves so we're gonna kick this off

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,470
with with Shaun and Dmitry talking about

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,920
some of the lessons learned that they

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,720
had when

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,820
when making a set-piece multi-cloud

00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,159
strategy real one of the problems that

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,090
they faced how did they overcome Lisa

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,160
and so forth then we're gonna talk about

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,459
how to manage hybrid cloud environments

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,260
right how to move from on-premise to the

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,030
cloud what does it take to operate all

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,580
of this how does this open service boca

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,080
api fit into this we heard about already

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,140
heavy talking about this at the keynote

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,410
stage so this is what sean from h HCL

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,540
will cover and we got told colleagues of

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:34,310
mine and andreas and martin that will

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,810
talk about how do you keep a large

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,810
distributed platform running

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,160
continuously or brooming continuously

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,280
what does it take from having a

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,959
multinational team span across three

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,030
different time zones how do you interact

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,459
how do you operate so really about how

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,980
do you use learning and monitoring

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,299
approaches and so forth - yeah keep up

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,440
to speed with what's what's happening

00:02:54,299 --> 00:03:01,290
underneath next is my colleague Nikhil -

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,560
or social apps he will also talk about

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,350
lifecycle management what it takes to

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,470
really yeah operators that at large and

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,739
people also talk about on a new service

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,440
that people of the rolling out this

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:21,810
shows you how to really yeah orchestrate

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,280
this complex deployment process next is

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,340
Stephan who will talk about how to

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,959
secure the underlying a network stack

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,209
right if you're running this in a

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,910
multi-tenant environment with multiple

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,560
customers sharing the same platform you

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,030
want to make sure that the communication

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,190
is secure between the pass and the

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,880
underlying levels so this is what you

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,250
will cover in our IPSec bas-reliefs then

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,940
we going little towards the whole area

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,680
of IOT and challenges typically coming

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,100
with this so high-volume message

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,109
throughput how do we handle this

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,319
yeah how can we actually make sense of

00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:01,920
all the incoming data and process it in

00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:04,859
a sophisticated manner then we got a

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,860
being from Dell EMC she will also talk

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,930
about IOT and also about how they manage

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,030
to aggregate all this reading data

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,290
across the board and also how to you

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,010
know move from the development landscape

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,410
to production and in a seamless manner

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,630
and last but not least we got domain

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,540
from pivotal I'm also talking about

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:30,530
data-driven IOT apps so we have a big

00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:33,870
IOT section at the end of day 1 day 2

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:38,449
again we kick it off with a joint

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:41,160
session by mendax and s AP so Nagin and

00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:42,870
variety will talk about the rapid

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,930
application development tool VY mendax

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,740
which we have recently also partnered up

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,930
with to bring local development into the

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,060
enterprise and our ecosystem I mean our

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,639
rationale is simple knowing that

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,130
software is the number one

00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,680
differentiator and driver to you know

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:04,260
accelerate business possiblys we rethink

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,840
them remodel them there's a huge demand

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,580
for developers which probably before we

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,430
can be able to meet the demand so we

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,160
want to empower also non non engineers

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,479
non developers to really you know

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,830
participate in this digital

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,169
transformation journey by building new

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:23,400
applications using mendax tool instead

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,169
then we're going to talk about how to

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,450
set up a multi cloud enterprise-grade

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:29,820
found out found the installation

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,950
I'm joking will cover this so basically

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:36,330
saying okay we have been teaming up with

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:38,490
AWS adjure and GCP they all have their

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,940
little different nuances that we need to

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:44,220
you know account for and this is where

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,590
we have the AJ proxy which will handle

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,849
us to you know bridge these gaps and

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:53,729
have a common layer on top next thing is

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:55,530
Marc from kiti he will talk about

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,620
solving client telling for luxury goods

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,680
and I think the most interesting aspect

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,599
and in his abstract sauce was how he

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,150
really bridges this gap between having a

00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,380
consumer-grade you acts while at the

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,419
same time delivering on an

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,830
enterprise-grade and robustness of the

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,020
application

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:18,030
then we got a kissed off and crystianna

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:20,890
working on how to really manage all the

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,540
incoming unlocks you know and look at

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,670
looking todos manage those and have a

00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:29,020
common metric across the the whole

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:31,120
landscape infrastructure then we got a

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,920
dude you know hope i pronounce his name

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,780
right if not I'm really sorry who we'll

00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,900
talk about yeah then you obviously

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,820
feature that we have been I'm helping

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,620
and contributing to and this is

00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,700
basically saying if you provide lots of

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,260
accounts that are typically idling for

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,470
example a try landscape as we do with

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,540
cloud platform and you want to have a

00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,460
way to protect your resources and just

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,440
shut down the applications and put them

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,050
to art asleep until they got involved

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,970
again so quite a nifty tool also from

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,700
the provider side and providing a

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,870
developer experience to the outside

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,970
world and wrapping it up again with IOT

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,730
your bargain will also talk about yeah

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,410
how can you innovate at the edge when

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,060
all the data is being collected and how

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,160
do you get it from there into cloud

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,120
foundry at scale so that's pretty much

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,530
what we're trying to do here and thanks

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,220
for joining and without further ado I

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:30,150
want to ask Demetri and Shana take the

00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,150
