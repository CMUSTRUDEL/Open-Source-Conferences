	On-Demand Data Services with Cloud Foundry - Maria Ntalla & Simon Jones, Pivotal

Cloud Foundry services are a big part of what makes the platform so incredibly powerful; they allow developers to perform self-service provisioning of databases, message queues and anything else that can provide data to their applications. 

The ability to create services entirely on demand was one of Cloud Foundry’s most anticipated features. When the feature was added to Cloud Foundry, an exciting new era began for service authors and users alike. 

In this talk Maria and Simon will show how BOSH and the on-demand-broker are used to enable application developers to do self-service provision of services with configuration tailored to the application’s use case. They will also give an overview of how to develop an on-demand service, best practices and challenges they have seen during their experience with developing on demand service offerings.
