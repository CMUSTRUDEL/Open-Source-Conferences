	Distributed Tracing of Microservices - Neil Stevenson, Hazelcast

Microservices are generally perceived as a better application style than monolithic code, and
certainly this is a style that sits nicely within Cloud Foundry.

However, it’s not all good news. One of the drawbacks to such decomposition is it can be
very difficult to identify bottlenecks.

In this presentation, Neil will show how it’s easy this can solved for Spring Boot users. A few
beans and dependencies can activate tracing, and with Hazelcast as a service, trace information
can be centrally captured from to a fault-tolerant scalable in-memory repository.

Trace analysis can then be distributed across multiple service instances, without the performance bottleneck of a unclustered disk based resource.
