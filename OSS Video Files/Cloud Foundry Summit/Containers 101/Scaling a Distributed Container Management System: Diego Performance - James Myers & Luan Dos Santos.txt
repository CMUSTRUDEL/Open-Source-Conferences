Title: Scaling a Distributed Container Management System: Diego Performance - James Myers & Luan Dos Santos
Publication date: 2016-06-06
Playlist: Containers 101
Description: 
	As a distributed container management system, it is important that Diego not only runs containers, but it does so in a quick and timely manner. In small deployments with manageable work loads, it is easy for us to guarantee that Diego adheres to these performance requirements. However, as both the scale of the deployment and the amount of containers increases, it has become increasingly challenging for us to validate that Diego maintains its performance characteristics. 

This talk will dive into the steps that we took to design, perform, evaluate, and improve performance testing that has given us confidence in Diego as a backend to Cloud Foundry. Topics will include: how the Diego team designed performance experiments and testing suites given product requirements, how we evaluate a performant Diego environment, results that led to various performance changes in the system, and lastly how the Diego team is continuing to build out infrastructure to validate Diegoâ€™s performance at a larger scale on a more regular basis.
