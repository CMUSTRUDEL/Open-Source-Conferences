Title: Container Networking in Cloud Foundry - Matthew Sykes, IBM & Gabriel Rosenhouse, Pivotal

Description: 
	Modern applications consist of small, highly interconnected, independently scalable units of deployment that are often referred to as “microservices.” When you deploy these services on Cloud Foundry today, they are forced to communicate via routes that are advertised to the external routing tier. Not only does this force all services to be exposed to external clients, it adds significant latency to the interactions between services. 

What if instead of exposing routes to all of your services, you could define the network topology that’s right for your application? How about defining an isolation policy to prevent unauthorized access? What about enabling secure access to existing networks? 

The Cloud Foundry Container Networking project hopes to make these things a reality. Come learn about where we are today, where we’re going, and how you can help us get there.
