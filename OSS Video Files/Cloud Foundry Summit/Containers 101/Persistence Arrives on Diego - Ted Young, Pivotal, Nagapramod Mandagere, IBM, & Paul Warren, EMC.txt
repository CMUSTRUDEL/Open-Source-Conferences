Description: 
	Persistent Storage is coming to Diego! IBM, Pivotal, and EMC have partnered to extend the Cloud Foundry runtime to include persistence storage. We discuss the approach we are taking, how distributed filesystems and block storage services fit well with our service broker abstraction. and how we plan to offer these services in the marketplace. An overview of the types of storage, their differences, and the effect they have on scheduling and the application lifecycle will be discussed. Example use cases for each type of storage will be covered. We will also discuss the pros and cons of running databases and other services directly on Cloud Foundry.
