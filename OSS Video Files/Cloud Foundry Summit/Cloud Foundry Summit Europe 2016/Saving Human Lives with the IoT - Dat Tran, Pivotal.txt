	Saving Human Lives with the IoT - Dat Tran, Pivotal

Nearly 1.2 million people die in road crashes each year (WHO - 2015) with additional millions becoming injured or disabled. One big part of this problem is worst road traffic conditions and unless action is taken, road traffic injuries are predicted to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030. Moreover, although road traffic injuries have been a major cause of mortality for many years, most traffic accidents are both predictable and preventable. In this talk, we want to demonstrate a scalable IoT platform that uses weather data and data from other cars to warn drivers of dangerous conditions. We will show how CF can help to save human lives and the architecture behind this. Additionally, we will also explain the data science that is involved.
