	Simple Abstractions for the Challenge of Complexity - How Cloud Foundry's Layered Approach Allows for Isolated Components and a Pattern for Reuse - Duncan Winn, Pivotal

Simple abstractions for the challenge of complexity - how Cloud Foundry's layered approach allows for isolated components and a pattern for reuse.”

With all the hype around trends such as microservices, DevOps, and continuous delivery, what does it look like in reality? Cloud Foundry, including both the way it is architected, and developed, expertly demonstrate how these trends are established and why they make sense for distributed architectures such as Cloud Foundry.

This talk comes from spending three years writing a technical book on Cloud Foundry that explores the core components, the beauty of Diego’s abstraction , the value and progression of BOSH and the essential steps required for debugging CF.

This talk is intended for anyone getting started with CF or anyone who wants to see real world examples of the aforementioned trends in practice.
