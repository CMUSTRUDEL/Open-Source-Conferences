	Private, Hybrid & Public Cloud CF Environments on Microsoft Azure - Mario Szpuszta, Microsoft

Microsoft Azure is a public cloud platform available across 38 regions world-wide. Microsoft has worked on an official CPI to enable CloudFoundry on Azure with the Open Source Community and Pivotal. This CPI is available for about a year, now! In this presentation, Gil and Mario will go beyond the basics and will focus on running Private, Hybrid and Globally Distributed CF Clusters in Microsoft Azure and Azure Stack. They will show you how-to get them implemented and how you can re-use your assets across the public cloud (Azure) and the private Cloud (Azure Stack). They'll discuss how failover can happen across multiple environments and what the caveats are by deploying CF Clusters and apps across those environments.
