	Keynote: The Shift to a New Digital Allianz Germany - Dr. Daniel Poelchau, Allianz

The fast progress of digitalization is a challenge for Allianz Germany. Customers compare the value of products and services of their insurance companies to the intuitive offerings they are used to from other industries. Additionally, there is a growing number of Startups and InsurTechs shaping the market with innovative ideas and their aim to take possession of the customer interface. This means: in order to be still market leader in ten years, Allianz Germany needs to get digital by default and to be fully geared to customersâ€™ needs and expectations of the digital age.

We recognized the necessity for a wide-ranging digital transformation at Allianz Germany and translated the key factors into our corporate strategy. Of course, two decisive factors are the shift towards a co-located and agile software development together with the implementation of an elastic Cloud Foundry infrastructure which offers easy scalability of successful products.
