	Snakes in a Buildpack: Deploying Data Science in Cloud Foundry - Ian Huston & James Wen, Pivotal

The Cloud Foundry Buildpacks team set out on a journey in February to go where no official buildpack has gone before: Data Science. Working with those most elusive creatures, data scientists, we toiled in the deepest darkest crevices of our stacks and buildpacks to find a way to easily support the PyData ecosystem. We discovered a package manager called Conda and migrated it to the buildpacks’ zoo, where it now lives in glorious captivity.

Join us as we share our story with you! From idea inception to experiment after experiment after experiment after… you get the idea. We’ll share our initial working hypothesis and subsequent surprising discoveries, dive into the innards of buildpacks and stacks and detail what it was like working with the Pivotal Data Science team as our first customer. Finally, we’ll `cf push` a python data science app with no vendored dependencies!
