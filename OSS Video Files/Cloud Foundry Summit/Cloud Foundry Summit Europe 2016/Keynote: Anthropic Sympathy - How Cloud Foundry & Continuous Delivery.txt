	Keynote: Anthropic Sympathy - How Cloud Foundry & Continuous Delivery Make Humans Happier and More Productive - Daniel Jones, CTO, EngineerBetter

Cloud Foundry and Continuous Delivery make it possible to exploit the findings of cognitive psychology and neuroscience to increase the productivity and happiness of our teams.

This session will answer: 
• How can we improve willpower & decrease technical debt? 
• Is the present bias real? How can we turn it to our advantage? 
• Can you increase a team’s effective IQ? 
• How do DevOps & Product Teams increase empathy, and what impact does empathy have on productivity? 
• Why is Cloud Foundry vital to all of this?

“Mechanical sympathy” was popularized in software development when LMAX inverted the practice of writing software in a style that befitted humans, and instead wrote code that exploited characteristics of the hardware it ran upon. This talk makes the argument that our processes are software, our teams the platform, and our brains the hardware (wetware!) that runs it.
