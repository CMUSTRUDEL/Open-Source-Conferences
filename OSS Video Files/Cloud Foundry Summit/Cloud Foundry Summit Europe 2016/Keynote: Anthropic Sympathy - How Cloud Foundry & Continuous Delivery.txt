Title: Keynote: Anthropic Sympathy - How Cloud Foundry & Continuous Delivery
Publication date: 2016-09-30
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2016
Description: 
	Keynote: Anthropic Sympathy - How Cloud Foundry & Continuous Delivery Make Humans Happier and More Productive - Daniel Jones, CTO, EngineerBetter

Cloud Foundry and Continuous Delivery make it possible to exploit the findings of cognitive psychology and neuroscience to increase the productivity and happiness of our teams.

This session will answer: 
• How can we improve willpower & decrease technical debt? 
• Is the present bias real? How can we turn it to our advantage? 
• Can you increase a team’s effective IQ? 
• How do DevOps & Product Teams increase empathy, and what impact does empathy have on productivity? 
• Why is Cloud Foundry vital to all of this?

“Mechanical sympathy” was popularized in software development when LMAX inverted the practice of writing software in a style that befitted humans, and instead wrote code that exploited characteristics of the hardware it ran upon. This talk makes the argument that our processes are software, our teams the platform, and our brains the hardware (wetware!) that runs it.

good evening everybody thanks for

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,250
holding out to the end of the day in

00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,570
software development we sometimes talk

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,849
about something called mechanical

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,309
sympathy and this is the idea that we

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,619
structure our code not based on how

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,570
humans want to model the problem and not

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,449
based on how humans want to read the

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,430
code but instead in a way that exploits

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,380
the power and capabilities of the

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,050
hardware that's running it normally to

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,000
make it go faster tonight I'm going to

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,520
make the argument for anthropic sympathy

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,469
because I believe that our business

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,719
processes and development methodologies

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,660
unlike software but they're running on

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,910
the wetware that's in our heads and for

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,469
too long we've copied what works in

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,690
factories in the Industrial Revolution

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,730
when really software development is

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,579
different so we're going to look very

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,430
briefly at some findings from cognitive

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,579
psychology and neuroscience about why

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,289
the way most of us here work is more

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,320
productive and how Cloud Foundry can

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,000
support that you're probably familiar or

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,850
you definitely familiar by the end of

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,010
today with a situation like this this

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,500
kind of diagram has been up on screen

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,020
lots of times at an organization working

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,270
in silos functional teams each with a

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,770
speciality we all know the story you

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,600
need someone from each of them to

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,780
deliver any business value and that

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,490
involves a lot of coordination typically

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,680
in these situations the people from one

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,420
silo feel like the people in the other

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,610
silos don't really care about their

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,380
problems they don't work together to try

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,090
and ease each other's frustrations which

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,320
is weird because they all work for the

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,360
same company so they should be working

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,409
together right is there something to

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,970
that it turns out there might be an

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,500
experiment was performed where control

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,049
group of subjects were placed into an

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,820
fMRI scanner which measures levels of

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,729
activity in different areas of the brain

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,369
over time when they're in that scanner

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,560
they were shown different videos either

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,270
a hand being lightly touched with a

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,490
cotton wall bud or a q-tip for the

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,079
Americans in the audience or being

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,280
stabbed painfully with a syringe and

00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,590
levels of activity in the neural

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,679
networks associated with experiencing

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,120
empathy and pain were measured the

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,560
experiment was then repeated with a

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,720
different group of subjects

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,790
this time they had to identify the

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,459
religious beliefs before going into the

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,300
scanner or you atheist are you Muslim

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:27,810
are you seek are you a Jew this time

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,970
when they were shown the videos the

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,760
religious identity of the person being

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,849
hurt was also shown and what did they

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,310
find they found that when the person

00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:41,130
being hurt identified the same way there

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,440
was a larger empathic response but when

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,450
the person being hurt identified

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,600
differently and there was a smaller

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,510
empathic response smaller than when

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,430
there were no categories at all so this

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,280
showed us that people care less about

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:59,130
out groups and if we go back to our

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,989
silos but what are we doing we're

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,260
cutting up our organizations into tribes

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,930
my team and your team my tribe and your

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,180
tribe my group and your group so not

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,950
only are these people not working

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,560
together so they don't see each other's

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,450
frustrations and problems and pain even

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,040
if they do see it the way that we

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,269
structure our businesses means that

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,620
they're less likely to care luckily this

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,019
is where Cloud Foundry comes into it

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,959
Cloud Foundry allows us a smaller

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:30,569
problem space we need less broad and

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,340
less deep knowledge in fewer areas so

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,959
what do I mean by problem space well

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,420
that's what we needed to deliver

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,850
business value before and it adds up to

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,739
a space that looks kind of like this but

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,660
because we have the abstraction of a

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,950
platform as a service we don't need to

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,049
worry so much about infrastructure

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,769
networks and deployments when we're

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:50,069
delivering apps

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,569
hell even databases we don't need to

00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,280
know so much about those we just need to

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,040
know how to consume them rather than how

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,480
to stand them up so we end up with a

00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,220
problem space which is a lot smaller

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,639
it's a fraction of what it was before

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,370
and because it's smaller we can condense

00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,190
all of the knowledge we need into one

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,190
team one product team with a shared

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,190
identity which saves us from this out

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,019
group problem everybody's issues in that

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,320
team are shared by the whole team

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,810
because they've got the same identity

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,430
now we have that one team because Cloud

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,260
Foundry gives us a smaller problem space

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,630
we can consider co-locating it put

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:32,380
all in the same place and then we can

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,780
get extra benefits to three Norwegian

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,970
scientists performed a study aiming to

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,950
correlate productivity with human

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:43,030
capital so the education and experience

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:45,640
of people in the businesses they also

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,310
aim to correlate productivity with

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,860
social capital so how often people

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,360
communicate it how many people they

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,800
communicated with in all three cases

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,130
social capital correlated positively

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,160
with productivity in two out of three

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,230
cases the human capital that education

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,940
and experience of staff did not

00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:11,830
correlate with productivity at all and

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,170
this makes sense right if you think

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,460
about an economic Network its value is

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,690
determined by the number of nodes you

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,550
have and the number of connections

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,340
between those nodes if this is the

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,740
telephone network it's not very good but

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,330
if you add more nodes and more

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,510
connections between those nodes you have

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,610
a more productive and valuable network

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:33,310
so if this is our organization we can

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,620
make it even more effective by making

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,140
these communications more efficient

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,930
making them less likely to fail and we

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,140
can do that with empathy and the human

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,140
brain

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:49,360
now when you saw this picture your

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,220
eyebrows may have raised a little your

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,660
eyes may have widened a little bit and

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,890
when you're watching films maybe this

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,510
happens when you're watching a

00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,770
characters face maybe when you're

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,570
talking someone particularly engaging

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,580
you find yourself mirroring their

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,470
expression and this may be down to

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,240
mirror neurons which are brain cells

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,700
which fire both when an action is

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,120
performed and when it's perceived by an

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,320
observer and the mirror system has given

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,860
rise to something called the mirror

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:17,320
hypothesis and this is that when you see

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,690
another person's face your mirror system

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,720
fires causing you to start to mimic that

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,100
facial expression in lots of different

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,630
ways the brain gets different

00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,400
physiological information through a

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,500
phenomenon called embodied cognition and

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,580
that helps tip your decision-making

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,800
process so when you see someone smiling

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,889
it's not just that you know a semantic

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,800
fact that smiling people are happy

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:43,599
you put your body in the same state as

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,789
there so your brain has that shared

00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:48,999
context so you're experiencing firsthand

00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:51,520
how they feel and there's some good

00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:53,949
evidence for this a study was performed

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,990
where a control group was asked to

00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:58,900
identify emotions being expressed in

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,090
photographs and then the experiment was

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,189
repeated this time by people who'd have

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,990
Botox injections so they had their

00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,330
facial muscles paralyzed so they would

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,060
look less wrinkly when they got old on

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,639
average those people who'd had the Botox

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,580
injections were less able to correctly

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,490
identify the emotion as being expressed

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,020
why because they're broken that chain

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,750
they saw the face the mirror system

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,580
fired but they couldn't mimic it so they

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,710
were denying their brain this extra

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:30,460
physiological information that it uses

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:32,319
to inform itself so if we think about

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,810
our teams they're all in one place now

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,669
they can have fast face-to-face

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,860
communications that are efficient we can

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,360
increase their productivity by using

00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,229
empathy to lubricate those

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,750
communications but before we had our

00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:49,360
silos and before communications were

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:54,689
slow and that made organizing anything

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:57,279
quite costly scheduling a team's time

00:07:54,689 --> 00:08:00,159
was costly there was a high transaction

00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,439
cost to organizing anything so what did

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,259
we do how many times you seen one of

00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:07,810
these today up on the slides we decided

00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:09,669
to plan things way in advance because

00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,729
getting the testing teams time which

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,839
take two weeks in and of itself and

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:16,300
because the transaction costs of

00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,909
organizing anything were high we decided

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,279
that we would work on aspects rather

00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:23,050
than features so we'd ask the testing

00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,969
team to do the testing for all of this

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,089
quarters features all at once and

00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:30,250
typically in a situation like this low

00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:32,769
testing comes right at the end and

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,289
typically in a situation like this load

00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:37,240
testing fails but we're doing waterfall

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:39,820
we've got a requirements document it

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,349
clearly states in chapter 73 point B

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,479
that we need to be able to handle a

00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:46,510
thousand requests a second why does this

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,760
fail it may well be because of the

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,440
present bias this is a well observed

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,420
psychological phenomenon that says that

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,980
humans value

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,200
is more highly when they're closed and

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,720
they discount value for things that are

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,269
far away this is why people often buy

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,029
furniture on interest-free credit by now

00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,680
pay in two years time that costs this

00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,990
discounted little further away it is

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,760
it's why you're more likely to give your

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,889
sandwich to a starving child next to you

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,510
than you are to phone up comic relief

00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,970
and make the payment powered by Cloud

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,550
Foundry for a starving child 3,000 miles

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,889
away now this is well observed and has

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,110
been for decades but what's new and

00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:24,209
what's interesting is that it looks like

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:28,740
it has a biological neurological

00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:30,810
underpinning wrong direction

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,029
how you got to watch my animations again

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,610
now there we go

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:37,440
rhesus monkeys were given a choice

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,079
between a little bit of sugar water now

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,019
or a bit more sugar water in a few

00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,910
seconds time and by varying that second

00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,279
option in the size of the sugar water

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,230
and the delay until they got it

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,620
scientists were able to map out their

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,420
preferences their behavioral preferences

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,100
they then inserted electrodes into the

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,890
intra parietal area of these monkeys

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,199
brains and observed the firing rate of

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,850
specific neurons so the fast of the

00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:05,100
neurons fire the more attractive the

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,860
option is the slower they fire the less

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,630
attractive they found that the firing

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,899
rates of these neurons mapped

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:16,800
one to one with the observed behavior of

00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:19,110
these monkeys that means that there is a

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,760
biological explanation for the present

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:25,140
bias and that means we can't escape it

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,699
it's unavoidable we can rationalize

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,980
about it but we're not going to be able

00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:30,690
to get away from it so how can we

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,990
exploit the present bias instead of

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,430
being victims of it well it's obvious

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,709
now isn't it the low testing doesn't

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,959
happen for three months it's not present

00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:43,740
in anyone's mind it's not important

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:45,810
today but this is where Cloud Foundry

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,970
comes in again we've got a smaller

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,639
problem space we don't need half of this

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:55,050
stuff can you tell I recently discovered

00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:57,029
Kino animations we've got one team now

00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,740
doing TDD because doing it the other way

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:03,829
around doesn't make much sense and

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,100
importantly that one team has

00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,140
self-service

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,790
they can do what they need to do when

00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,580
they need to do it they can provision

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,790
databases on demand and that means

00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,470
combined with the lack of scheduling the

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:19,530
self-service makes it economical to work

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:23,640
on one feature at a time and that makes

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:25,740
the load testing important now we're

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,480
exploiting the present bias because

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,610
everything needed for that feature is

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,520
important today because we're working on

00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:36,690
all of that feature today not in three

00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,730
months time plan founders self-service

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:42,060
enables us to work on in features

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,710
instead of aspects it enables us to do

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,330
that

00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:47,250
it also offers us control over our

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,740
environments and automation of

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,810
production deployments and it turns out

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,200
that that can help us reduce technical

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:57,090
debt as well so there's great book

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
called scarcity that collects a lot of

00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,840
research about the psychological effects

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,930
of being made aware that you don't have

00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,700
enough of something a typical study was

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,670
one performed in a New Jersey shopping

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,550
mall subjects were posed a hypothetical

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,770
question you've been involved in a car

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,660
accident your insurance company isn't

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,050
going to cover the costs how are you

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,780
going to pay for the repairs to your car

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:24,840
subjects were split into two groups

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:26,970
depending on the income either rich or

00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,370
poor and within those groups there asked

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,680
a different flavor of the question

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,620
either they had to cover a $300 cost or

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,700
a $3,000 cost

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,960
straight afterwards they were given a

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,220
fluid intelligence test

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,310
this is Ravens progressive matrices

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,630
which is often used as an IQ test now

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,550
for the rich people it didn't matter

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,190
when they were asked the 3,000 or the

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,200
$300 question it didn't have any impact

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,480
on their fluid intelligence test scores

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,160
for the poor people it didn't have any

00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,100
impact if they're asked the $300

00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,840
question but for the poor subjects who

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,420
were asked to cover a three thousand

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:04,380
dollar cost their affective IQ dropped

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:06,090
by 13 to 14 points just by being made

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,250
aware that they didn't have something

00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:11,610
enough of something that was important

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,590
to them the researchers went and looked

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,290
for other effects of scarcity as well

00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,880
particularly on executive control and

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,430
functions of executive control involve

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,020
self-control and willpower also

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,490
prospective memory your ability to

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,130
remember to do something in the future

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,110
this is a Stroop test this tests

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,120
self-control by making you inhibit

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,970
certain responses from your brain so

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,260
rather than say the color the word is

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,900
printed in you're supposed to read the

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,600
word itself time and again they found

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,750
that scarcity reduces willpower and

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,490
prospective memory now this effect can

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,810
be triggered by not have enough money it

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,410
can be triggered by not having enough

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:52,590
social content importantly for us it can

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:55,270
be triggered by not having enough time

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,790
now you think about your engineers and

00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,140
you think about what happens now when

00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,710
you remind them that they've got a

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,300
deadline

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,460
oh you better hurry up because you've

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,320
got to get this done by Friday you're

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,600
reducing your ability to solve abstract

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,130
problems you're reducing their willpower

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,170
making them more susceptible to

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,910
technical debts and what's even worse

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,260
than that you're reducing their

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,820
prospective memory so they're less

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,790
likely to remember that they need to

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:21,910
patch the corners they cut and why are

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,920
we doing this when we were working in

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,440
the old way with silos it were busy

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,980
because there would be knock-on effects

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,320
if we relate if you're doing scrum

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,480
you're doing this every two weeks

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,400
because you're making a commitment why

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,990
are you making that commitment yes sir

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,520
we won't get the work on sir I promise

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:43,030
sir we are working at hard we can sir

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:47,050
honest but you know what there's a

00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:49,990
better way Cal foundry allows us to

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,820
continuously deliver into production you

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,560
want to know how fast my team goes I'm

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,540
not going to predict the future I'm not

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,070
clairvoyant you look at what we've put

00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,170
into production in the last two weeks

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,940
you look at what we've already done and

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,040
how quickly we do it and how much

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,710
business value is going to customers

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,960
every day that's how you find out that

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,920
we're really working for you and you can

00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,720
combine that with two very simple ideas

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,680
let's go back to our project plan it's

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,590
not really much of a project plan

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,890
anymore but if we rotate it 90 degrees I

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:23,050
need sound effects for this as well gosh

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:25,510
then we've got what looks like an audit

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:27,490
backlog if we always work on the most

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:30,640
important thing we're never giving off

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,090
if we always deliver it in the simplest

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,530
way possible

00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,180
than we're taking a shortest route to

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:38,060
business value we're not over

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,180
engineering things we can't trim any

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,120
more fat off of that task it's we're

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,040
going as quickly as we possibly can so

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,060
sticking a date on a calendar isn't

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,280
gonna make any difference

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,460
that's like shouting at the planet Earth

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,800
to make it go fast around the Sun it's

00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,980
not gonna go any faster the work will

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,810
get done when the work gets done by

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,360
continuously delivering the most

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,520
important thing in the simplest way you

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,590
can free your engineers of the tyranny

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,950
of the scarcity effect and reduce the

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,510
technical debt that they incur and it

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,950
turns out the continuous delivery can

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,490
help us with technical debt in another

00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:18,770
way - now you may have heard of a study

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,490
that was performed about 20 years ago in

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:24,620
US jails that found that if you had your

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,150
parole hearing at the end of the day you

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,370
only stood a 20 percent chance of

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,190
success but if you had your parole board

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,650
hearing just after lunch you sort a 65

00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,510
percent chance of success for a long

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,000
time people thought that that had to do

00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,160
with glucose that the parole board had

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,290
eaten lunch that ingested glucose which

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,210
metabolized into lysine which is used in

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,400
the pre medial frontal cortex which is

00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:49,400
responsible for executive control that

00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,450
we mentioned earlier but it looks like

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,900
there might be something else happening

00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:56,150
a more recent study ask people to

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,790
perform an exhaustive Stroop test very

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:01,520
long Stroop test that exhausted their

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:04,520
self-control subjects were then asked to

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,620
gargle one of two drinks either drink

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,430
with glucose in or artificially

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:12,410
sweetened drink so gardling

00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:14,120
spits it straight down and immediately

00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,580
afterwards they were given another

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,380
willpower test to squeeze a handgrip

00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,650
exerciser for as long and as hard as

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:25,730
possible the people who had the glucose

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,620
drink did significantly better on the

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,720
subsequent willpower test but they

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,580
hadn't the goggled that's about the

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,790
drink out they wouldn't have had time to

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,500
metabolize any glucose what was going on

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,000
well it turns out the glucose was

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,100
binding to chemical receptors in the

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,140
tongue which was activating the reward

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,110
matrix in the brain and it's the sense

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,140
of reward

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,390
the replenishes wall power and this

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,160
makes perfect sense anecdotally this is

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,760
why good days are self-fulfilling and

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,530
why bad days get worse I'm having a bad

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,760
day are I'm gonna have that cake I'm

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,860
gonna smoke that cigarette I'm gonna

00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,630
have some beer I'm gonna let myself down

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,750
because you're seeking rewards that

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:07,049
you're not getting it elsewhere let's go

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,429
back to our order backlog now instead of

00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:10,350
us having a job well done

00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:12,270
after three months by which time we've

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,270
moved on to something else we're ticking

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:17,070
off features on a daily basis inside a

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,830
day if you've managed to batch your

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,230
tasks small enough not only are your

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:24,090
engineers going to feel more motivated

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,870
because they're more rewarded but

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,919
they're going to have better

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:31,370
self-control as well Cloud Foundry

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,540
allows us a smaller problem space

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,150
requiring less broad and deep knowledge

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,610
so we can have product teams with a

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,890
shared identity we can then co-locate

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,919
them to get these extra benefits of face

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,440
to face human interaction Cloud Foundry

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,870
self service makes it economical for us

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,000
to work on features instead of aspects

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,270
which allows us to exploit the present

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,470
bias rather than fall victim to it and

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,450
cloud foundries control over

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,080
environments and automation and the

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:03,030
simplicity of CF push enables continuous

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,730
delivery which can make our engineers

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:10,410
feel more rewarded and reduce the amount

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:12,929
of technical debt that they incur now I

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,549
think businesses are made of two things

00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:16,919
right the hard-earned money of

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:20,549
shareholders and easily spent time of

00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,919
employees and it's easy to be glib about

00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:24,630
the hard-earned money of shareholders

00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:29,190
when we live in what is a very unequal

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:31,799
time however Sam Ramsey pointed out to

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,590
me last year that time is measured in

00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:36,360
heartbeats not in seconds you're all

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,440
spending heartbeats listening to me and

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,919
I hope you're not going to ask for a

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:45,390
refund but we also know that time is

00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:48,570
money therefore money is heartbeats as

00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:51,030
well somebody gave up heartbeats to earn

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:54,120
a wage to invest to pass on to their

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,230
children if we are knowingly

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,150
doing inefficient on

00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,580
productive things because we're copying

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,500
whatever Henry Ford did a hundred years

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,490
ago when he found the best way of making

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,100
identical cars

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:10,150
time and time again then we're wasting

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,559
other people's heartbeats needlessly and

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,970
I don't know about you but I can't go

00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,940
into work in the morning thinking that

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:23,080
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna leave

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:24,850
you with one just thank you I'm gonna

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,160
leave you with one more thought and a

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,669
cheeky but respectful paraphrasing of a

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:34,240
great man one has a moral responsibility

00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:36,850
to change unfit processes we've gone

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,890
into these technical topics very

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:41,770
shallowly the psychology is there and it

00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,390
sounds but I hope this has given you

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,250
some ideas and I hope you have the

00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,440
courage to go back and make some changes

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,770
in your organization's when you're done

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,029
here thank you very much

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,029
