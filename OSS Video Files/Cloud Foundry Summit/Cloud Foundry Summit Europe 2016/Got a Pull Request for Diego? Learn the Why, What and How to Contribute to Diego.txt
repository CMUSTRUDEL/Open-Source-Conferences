	Got a Pull Request for Diego? Learn the Why, What and How to Contribute to Diego - Jen Spinney, HPE & Luan Santos, Pivotal

So you’ve found a bug in Diego, and you’re excited to make a contribution to the project. Great! Now how do you get your fix accepted into the Diego codebase? 

This talk will walk through the process of implementing a small change, writing and running the tests, and following the Diego team’s best practices for Golang development. It will cover common reasons for pull requests to be rejected and peel back the curtains on how the Diego team handles code contributions from developers outside the core team. 

We will use the Diego project as a concrete example, but many of the steps discussed will apply to the other Cloud Foundry projects as well.
