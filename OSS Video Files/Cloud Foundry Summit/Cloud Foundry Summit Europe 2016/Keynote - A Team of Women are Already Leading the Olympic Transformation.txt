	Keynote - A Team of Women are Already Leading the Olympic Transformation. Will Cloud be the Catalyst for Greater Diversity in IT? - Ursula Morgenstern, Global Head of Consulting & Systems Integration, Atos

Thanks to cloud, analytics and mobile technologies, the Olympics is being transformed into a global connected experience through a centralized cloud model.  This transformation is being led by an outstanding team of senior women at Atos.  Unfortunately, the diversity gap, in particular the gender balance, remains stronger in IT than in other industries. 

Research is showing that diversity including gender diversity has a positive impact on corporate performance. 

Will open and collaborative technologies such as cloud create the pull for women and minorities to â€“ at last - extend their contribution to IT and, further, to enterprise innovation and performance?
