	Cloud Foundry Growing Pains: Lessons Learned Keeping the Largest CF Environment Alive and Kicking - Michael Maximilien, IBM

Bluemix is the largest CF environment by far. It is also arguably the one with the most usage and users. Come to this talk to hear from the World Wide DevOps and development team who answers the call when things go wrong and who also help keep Bluemix up to date and running. 

We plan to share what we have learned in the past year as we grew and encountered unexpected failures and how we dealt with them.
