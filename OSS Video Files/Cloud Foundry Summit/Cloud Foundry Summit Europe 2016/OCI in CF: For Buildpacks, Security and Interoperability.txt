	OCI in CF: For Buildpacks, Security and Interoperability - Julz Friedman, IBM & Will Pragnell, Pivotal

The CF buildpacks workflow allows app developers to focus on the business logic of their code rather than the operational concerns of the OS that runs their code. At the same time, CF operators need confidence that all the code running in their org has been patched for the latest vulnerabilities. However, the current workflow does not currently support dynamically linked compiled languages well. This makes it very difficult to support apps written in C, haskell, et.al.; and also leaves us with a large difficult-to-protect surface area in our rootfs. We explore a solution to this problem using the new OCI container image specification, and demonstrate how this could result in a more flexible, more secure platform that supports better interoperability with the rest of the container ecosystem. For example, what if you could download your droplet and run it on any OCI container manager?
