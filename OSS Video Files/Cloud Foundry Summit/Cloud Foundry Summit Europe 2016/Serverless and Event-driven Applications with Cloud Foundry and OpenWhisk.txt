Description: 
	Serverless and Event-driven Applications with Cloud Foundry and OpenWhisk - Andrei Yurkevich, Altoros & Andreas Nauerz, IBM

Cloud Foundry represents a great platform for developing cloud-native apps. OpenWhisk is an open source serverless platform that instantly launches and scales out lightweight microservices and terminates them when they are no longer needed. It can power event-driven apps that can react to user- or machine-generated triggers to address spikes in traffic or requirements, like HA, reliability, and scalability, without the need to keep overcapacities.

In their presentation, Andreas and Andrei will talk about the sweetspots of traditional Cloud Foundry and serverless models, as well as cases where both models complement each other to create highly efficient cloud-native architectures. OpenWhisk’s core concepts, programming model, and general value proposition will be presented. Andreas and Andrei will conclude their session with a demonstration of practical examples of OpenWhisk-based end-to-end applications.
