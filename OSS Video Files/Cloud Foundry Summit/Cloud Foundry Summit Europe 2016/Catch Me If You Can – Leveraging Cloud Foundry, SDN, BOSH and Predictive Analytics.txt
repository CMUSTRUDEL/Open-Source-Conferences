	Catch Me If You Can – Leveraging Cloud Foundry, SDN, BOSH and Predictive Analytics to Outrun Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) While Maintaining Optimal Quality of Service (QoS) - Keith Strini, Merlin Glynn & Sean Keery, Pivotal

As we work to move the BOSH/Cloud Foundry ecosystem closer to an autonomous dynamic runtime architecture, it’s time to incorporate more layers of the OSI model into the fold to provide a more robust security posture and optimize performance. BOSH coupled with a properly architected SDN, can manage more complexity in its deployments such that each Cloud Foundry deployment can adapt in response to demands on the system, security policy, or degradation of network performance. By analyzing continuous feedback of key metrics and easily offloading these metrics to BOSH managed Big Data platforms, operators can now define Domain Specific Language (DSL) based strategies and pass them to BOSH to manage how to adapt the entire domain in response to changes in the health of the communications layers below it.

About Merlin Glynn
Merlin has been building complex environments for over 20 years {yeah he's an old guy}. While with IBM, he architected some of the worlds largest Supercomputers regularly being listed on the https://www.top500.org/. At VMware, he was the lead architect for VMware's global OneCloud. Now at Pivotal, he focuses on designing next generation Cloud Foundry platforms with Pivotal's key enterprise customers.

About Sean Keery
Sean Keery began hacking obscure video game systems at the age of 13. Sean then developed interpersonal skills while teaching snowboarding. Nowadays we've got Cloud Foundry, choreography, containers and plenty of io. Cluster deployments and IaaS independence occupy most days, while the daily commute is filled with podcasts and chipmunk bunny hops. Some family time, spicy food, a good book and hacking on the newest toy keep Sean busy at home.

About Keith Strini
Keith Strini is a Cloud Foundry Solutions Architect at Pivotal, implementing Cloud Foundry solutions across a wide variety of customer environments both in the Federal and Commercial space. He also served as a technology analyst for the US Department of Defense and Intelligence communities. In this capacity, he was responsible in aiding the enterprise management decision process and guiding the modernization migrations to cloud initiatives. In addition to this he provided strategic analysis to aide in the planning and investment projections necessary for this technology acquisition. He has helped architect, develop and execute the fielding of information systems across the Joint Services both CONUS and OCONUS (Korea, Japan, Europe, and the Middle East) and NATO.
