	Unleash the Multi-Cloud with BOSH - Jatin Naik, Pivotal

Cloud operators want to be able to run and manage systems on a variety of cloud providers. Today Cloud Foundryâ€™s BOSH only supports a single cloud provider for a given installation.

Introducing the BOSH meta CPI concept project which deploys multiple CPIs and allows a CPI to be chosen while deploying, giving operators the power to decide which IaaS is used for certain instance types and thus the ability to create a multi-cloud BOSH deployments. Uses cases for the meta CPI include deploying systems across multiple clouds, scaling from a private to a public cloud, running services on a particular IaaS that provides specialised hardware and executing errands in Garden containers.

Understand how to manage multi cloud deployments using a single BOSH installation and learn about the latency and network issues that arise.
