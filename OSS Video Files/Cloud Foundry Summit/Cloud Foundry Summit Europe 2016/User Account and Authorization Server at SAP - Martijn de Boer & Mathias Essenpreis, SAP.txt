Cloud Foundry's User Account and Authorization (UAA) server is a great tool that offers many possibilities and usage options. In this session we will deep dive on how we at SAP leveraged the features of the UAA. In particular we will show how we and our enterprise customers manage platform as well as business users including an enforced a 2-Factor Authentication.

Last but not least we also share our planned UAA contributions which we want to fine-tune with you.
