	Keynote: Confessions of a Cloud Foundry PaaS Product Owner: How to Create a Successful Devops Team in an Enterprise - Emma Hammond, Associate Director, Fidelity

Some would say successful devops is all about having the right tools. Emma Hammond believes it is all about people. It’s about trust & responsibility with the freedom to innovate, take risk & learn from failure. Much of this is alien to a traditional financial enterprise governed & protected by processes derived from years of operation – the ‘scar tissue’. Through the use of Cloud Foundry and software defined networks, Fidelity have been able to generate a new way of working to help mend these wounds and show the art of what is possible. Emma is very proud to have created the first devops team in Fidelity – their journey is worth sharing.
