Description: 
	Writing Cloud Native Applications to Execute on Cloud Foundry - Sufyaan Kazi & David Pinto, Pivotal

In this tutorial, Sufyaan Kazi and David Pinto will walk attendees through the architecture of a Stock Trading application which has been built as 5 distinct Spring Boot Microservices. They will also give attendees a walk through of how to deploy these Microservices to Cloud Foundry to create a highly available resilient application and how to utilise features such as binding apps to a database, using a Configuration Server to store config external to an application, using Service Discovery to avoid hard-coding application urls.

The tutorial is hands on and attendees are invited to take part and try the classes or just follow the instructors.
