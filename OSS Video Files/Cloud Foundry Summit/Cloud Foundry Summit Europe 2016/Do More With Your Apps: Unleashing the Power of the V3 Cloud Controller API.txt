	Do More With Your Apps: Unleashing the Power of the V3 Cloud Controller API - Utako Ueda and Dan Wendorf, Pivotal

Some of the biggest problems developers have had with the Cloud Controller API have traditionally revolved around lifecycle management of their apps. The lack of features like version rollbacks, zero downtime deployment, running one-off tasks, simplified database migration, and running multiple processes per application have frustrated many developers.

The CAPI team is working on making all this and more possible with V3 of the cloud controller API. The new application modeling provides much more flexibility and control over the workflows available to you for application deployment, while maintaining backwards compatibility with the Cloud Foundry interface you use today.

Utako and Dan will explain how to take advantage of the V3 API, and get into the details of the strategies involved in ensuring both dependable backwards compatibility and exciting new resource modularity.
