	Lightning Talk - IBM Bluemix - How an Internal Innovation Project Became the Biggest Cloud Foundry Service in the World - Simon Moser, Sr. Technical Staff Member and Dr. Max, Scientist, Architect, and Engineer, IBM

It's quite a story: in 2012, a bunch of developers in need of a platform where they can quickly push some applications without having to order infrastructure starting playing around with Cloud Foundry. A few years later, this project became commercially known as Bluemix, and with around 1 million users and hundreds of thousands running applications is probably the largest Cloud Foundry certified service in the world today. One reason for its popularity is Bluemix' great service ecosystem - which was fueled by technical contributions from and to the community and therefore serves as a great example how an open source community and a resulting service ecosystem impact each other.
