	Keynote - Innovating Around The Digital Core - Marc Geall, SVP, Head of Platform Partner Ecosystem, GCO, SAP; Steffen Stang, Director MindSphere R&D and Product Management, SIEMENS; & Bernd Issler, VP, Cloud & Enterprise Software, Atos

Find out how SAP is extending its ecosystem of ISVs to help customers turn digital disruption to advantage by leveraging agile cloud applications built on Hana Cloud Platform. Hear from SAP, Siemens and Atos about the joint journey they are taking.

SAP is helping its customers and partners embrace digital disruption. Digital Transformation allows customers to re-think classical business processes and take advantage of new inputs and insights to scale their businesses more quickly. However, the pace of innovation in most industries can be so fast that only an open ecosystem approach to Bimodal IT stands a chance of success, and one that connects directly to the most relevant business data. 

SAP is leveraging an open platform strategy that allows customers to build new applications and extensions, run these side-by-side ecosystem partner innovation (offered as packaged SaaS applications), and all natively integrated to their back-end systems, whether in the cloud or on-premise.
