	Docker & Buildpacks: One App, Two Options for Deploying to Cloud Foundry - Jen Spinney, HPE & James Myers, Pivotal

Now that Cloud Foundry natively supports pushing Docker containers in addition to the traditional approach of constructing an app from a buildpack, end-users have a choice about which strategy to use. In this talk, we’ll walk through pushing the same sample app to Cloud Foundry using both the buildpack and Docker container techniques. 

We’ll discuss the pros and cons of both approaches, and at the end of the talk, attendees will have a better sense of the ‘hows’ and the ‘whys’ of the buildpack and Docker application lifecycles in Cloud Foundry.
