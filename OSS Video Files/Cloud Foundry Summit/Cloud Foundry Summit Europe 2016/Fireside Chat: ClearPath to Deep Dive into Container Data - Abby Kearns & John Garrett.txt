hi good afternoon welcome to our

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,560
research deep dive on on containers my

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,170
name is John Garrett the founder and

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,509
partner of clear path strategies we are

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,280
an international political research and

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,650
strategy company we work for heads of

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,690
state political parties all around the

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,449
world from Ukraine to Georgia Australia

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,430
Austria to get this out of the way no I

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,619
don't work in the US no I don't think

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,349
Donald Trump will win and no you can't

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,119
blame if he does in addition to our

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,489
political work I've been working with

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,370
Sam Ramsey at Cloud Foundry foundation

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,219
since 2008 back when he was open-source

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,629
strategy lead at Microsoft he brought me

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,300
and the company I was with at the time

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,480
in to help with what he saw as more of a

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,340
campaign related challenge with selling

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,219
open source from the Microsoft

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,059
perspective or becoming more open and so

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,160
when he went to the Cloud Foundry

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,050
foundation he brought me in to help with

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,690
another campaign like project a little

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,520
project called cloud foundry and how

00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,500
cloud foundry can be brought to to

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,030
compete against the likes of AWS

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,920
Microsoft Google etc so here I am

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,830
political consultant talking about

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,590
containers we do regular surveys for

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,630
cloud foundry foundation abroad IT pros

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,010
and executives this is we've done our

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,479
for surveys and the one we're going to

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,360
talk about today is the the fourth

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,490
iteration the latest research today in

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,799
July based on the third round of

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,930
research we did a a report or June

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,780
excuse me did a report on containers

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,250
called hope versus reality which was

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,810
based on a survey that was exclusively

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,450
on containers and this is this is an

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,479
update on that on that research at the

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,119
time how six months later the the

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,100
industry and the use of containers has

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,020
evolved to help me do this someone

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,100
actually into the tech sector the real

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,490
star of the show many of you know her

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,009
already

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,229
Abbie Kearns Abbie is an 18 year veteran

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,479
of the tech sector currently is the VP

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,220
of industry strategy at cloud foundry

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,780
cloud foundry foundation and she's part

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,950
of been part of the CF community the

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,369
cloud foundry community for a couple of

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,920
years now

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,450
she's decidedly unencumbered by a career

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,610
in politics and bullshitting like myself

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,979
so you can trust her maybe not so much

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,350
me what you won't find in her bio online

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,590
she is an Olympic triathlete and a

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,610
circus lion tamer ABI so why don't you

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,530
tell us a little bit about what you've

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,390
been doing with cloud foundry and then

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,260
we'll kick it off don't know where to go

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,970
with the the lion tamer so but before we

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,190
get started also allotted about this

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,500
research this will all be released in a

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,650
report over the next couple of months

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,040
but this is a sneak peek so you are

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,600
seeing what no one else has seen to date

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
we do want this to be an interactive

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,860
session so if you have questions please

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,510
feel free to ask them otherwise we're

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,010
going to try to end a little early to

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,110
offer time at the end for you to ask

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,810
questions about the data or if you want

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:50,400
to drill down a little bit deeper we've

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,900
the research we release you know that he

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,820
referenced in June around hope versus

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,580
reality was really interesting to us

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,400
around containers container usage you

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,269
know having been in tack a long time I

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,540
anecdotally thought I understood the

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,300
market turns out I did not and it's

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,459
amazing how data can really unveil usage

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,660
patterns as well as trends and I think

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,950
that's what's gonna be the really

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,140
interesting part of the conversation

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,330
today great thanks

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,069
so let's get started and before we get

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,840
started with the data I wanted to start

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,459
with a little cartoon someone from my

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,950
office sent to me which I thought was

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,040
really appropriate and it's a Dilbert

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,260
cartoon and you know to me this this

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,019
mindset this mentality sums up what a

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,400
lot of enterprise thinks whether there's

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,600
DevOps or containers you know it's Arab

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,980
a little bit of containers on it and

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,019
poof all of a sudden digital

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,269
transformation that is not how it

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,280
actually works is it a B you know

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:45,120
containers will not transform you any

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,010
faster but we did learn through this

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,780
data and as well as the data back in

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,870
June is that more and more people are

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,630
using containers and they are using them

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,630
for workloads that aren't necessarily

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,250
density centric so one of the key points

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,769
that we made in our report in June was

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,450
really that while containers have been

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:04,560
around I mean for most of you here

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,269
you're like containers aren't new

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,930
containers have been around since 1979

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:12,840
the use of containers really picked up

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,350
in 2005 with Solaris zones but

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,690
containers were used historically for

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,579
improving density and increasing density

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,830
in the existing hardware you have but

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,580
what we saw in June was a shift in that

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,610
trend so using containers less for

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,710
increasing and proving

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,500
and more for shifting the way that you

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:35,560
work with application workloads so using

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,480
them more along the lines of version

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,240
runtimes and consistent build

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,030
environments and leveraging as part of

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,570
CI CD you know using them for to

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:49,060
continuous delivery type solutions so in

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,460
short no it will not magically make you

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,440
better but it is a great first step

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,850
right so it's a part of the of the

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,530
landscape the tech landscape that

00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,390
everyone is evaluating is they move

00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,770
towards CI CD as they move towards or

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,570
down the journey towards digital

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,460
transformation but it's not the solution

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,110
by itself no but it helps you frame that

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,690
up is your easier thinking about digital

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,070
transformation and realistically here at

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,420
this summit when we talk about digital

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,000
transformation we're talking about

00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,290
digital transformation alongside cloud

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,650
and the use of the adoption of cloud

00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,270
both public and private and is we think

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,920
about the value of containers and

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,050
containerized workloads it allows you to

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,910
think about the cloud and think about

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,410
the abstraction of your application as

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,560
you move towards those types of

00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:32,230
workloads great ok so finally let's

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,730
start getting towards numbers first

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,290
things first I'm a pollster which means

00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,000
I have to have my hygiene slide up here

00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,130
this is the methodology slide this is

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,560
what we did hi Devin this is who we

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,360
talked to it's a broad IT pro and

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,020
executive survey as I mentioned it's not

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,640
a Cloud Foundry survey or a user survey

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,980
it's not a developer service broad IT

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,530
Pro and exec survey it's global in

00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:57,130
nature we talked to folks in 8 different

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,140
countries translated into the into the

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,900
native languages those countries it's

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,430
it's you know not just enterprise about

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,140
2/3 of it or Enterprise was not just

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,300
enterprise it's across the roles devs

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,970
ops managers line of business so it's

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,400
it's a broad look it's also a more

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,110
informed audience we'd like listening to

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,790
respondents that actually know what

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,050
they're talking about so some people

00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,070
when they're taking online services just

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,750
click click click and go right through

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,950
we make sure we have some traps in there

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,200
to make sure people are actually

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,970
informed and and not just speeding

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,890
through the survey so if there's any

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,000
built-in inherent bias in this area it's

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,410
that they're actually maybe a little

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,380
more informed than than the broader

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,490
audience all right so let's dive in so

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,590
the first slide and just so you know all

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,960
numbers are percentages unless I say

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,370
otherwise so as you see here on the on

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,470
the left hand side that's our previous

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,230
survey for

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,780
7% what this is showing this is showing

00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,160
container deployment who's using

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,300
containers companies that are using

00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,370
containers the percentage of companies

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,930
using containers and at what stage so

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,880
you see on the left hand side six months

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,010
ago forty-seven percent of companies

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,870
were not using containers which means 53

00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,580
percent were and that declines that's

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,650
the major you know trend on this slide

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,960
the other trends trend on the slide is

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,320
that the the usage that we're seeing

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,990
increase 22 to 30 5% of container uses

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,730
it's all in the early stages so POC

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,230
trial stage that's where the use that's

00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,390
where the increase is what we're not

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,740
seeing is any uptake in the limited

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,090
deployment rolling out in business

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,850
groups or the broad deployment rolling

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,890
out across the entire company and so so

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,450
as even though container usage is

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,770
increasing what we're seeing here in

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,280
this data what the data are showing me

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,690
here are is that the the depth and

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,230
breadth of the usage has an increase

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,820
that stayed flat why is that well even

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,410
more interesting is you know we

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:42,240
referenced earlier the research we did

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:44,760
in June was that most of the most of the

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,120
container usage was early stage it was

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,470
POCs it was user it was under evaluation

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,300
with most of those saying that within

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,730
the next 6 to 12 months they would be

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,590
moving to broad deployment so we termed

00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,840
it mainstream in that research but

00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,450
essentially moving these containerized

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,630
workloads from dev and tests and moving

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,100
them out into production and so we were

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,770
we were expecting when we did this

00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,890
research to see a massive upswing in

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,080
that and turns out we were wrong because

00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,850
what ended up happening is yes more

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,550
people are using containers but they're

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,229
still using them and POC and development

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,030
type environments which means they

00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:24,570
haven't quite taken that leap to take

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:26,810
things from you know internal dev and

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,100
tests and moving that to production and

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,860
while we're seeing more people using it

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,070
which is great if you'll notice the

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,080
percentages we're still sub 50 we are

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,789
where they're this is while we talk a

00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,159
lot about containers and containers have

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,710
been part of of our conversation for a

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,900
couple of years within this community

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,930
we're still not seeing broad adoption

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:51,510
and what was what's really interesting

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,680
for for me and particularly being in

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,120
tech and being in the community we

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,459
talked about micro services we talked to

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,290
containers for several years now but

00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,800
looking at how people are actually using

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,600
these in organizations around the world

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,850
they're not there yet and so we use a

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,410
lot of buzzwords micro-services

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,800
containers cloud native application

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,120
architectures but most people are still

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,059
trying to figure that out and how to

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,160
make use of those technologies so six

00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:19,709
months ago what you're saying is that

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,459
the users were saying that in six or

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:22,740
twelve months we were going to be

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,509
mainstreaming containers we'd be using

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,660
containers crossing to our company

00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:29,610
clearly that hasn't panned out so they

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,959
were all wrong but how about you what do

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,879
you think six to twelve months from now

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,899
or when winter containers what are we

00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,279
going to see broader adoption of

00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,269
containers or is it just a fad they're

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,339
gonna play with it they're gonna kick it

00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:43,740
out what don't think containers are a

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:46,019
fad nor do I think the cloud is a fad my

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,480
even-even Larry Ellison's bought into it

00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,089
so clearly it's not a fad anymore

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,350
I I would say the next six to twelve

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,990
months we'll start seeing broader

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,490
adoption I think some of the other data

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,559
that we're going to talk about here in

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,360
terms of workloads and use cases we're

00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,249
starting to see an uptick in cloud

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,199
native application architectures within

00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:05,550
we're starting to see an uptick in use

00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:07,559
and then the conversation within our

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,230
community with large organizations that

00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,339
are starting to work towards digital

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,110
transformation which means they're

00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,699
trying to figure out how to take cloud

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,420
and use cloud and make that part of

00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:20,759
their technology centric approach so I

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,139
think we'll see starting to see an

00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,579
uptick I don't think it's going to be a

00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,779
massive swing in the next six to twelve

00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:27,240
months but I think we'll start seeing

00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,649
both an increase in container usage as

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,920
well as an increase of those broad

00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:33,329
deployments great and you alluded to you

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,459
know cloud native architecture and

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:38,249
conveniently this is our next slide how

00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,929
are people using containers and what the

00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:42,179
data are showing us on the left-hand are

00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,679
the workloads that they have deployed in

00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:45,269
containers and on the right we'll get to

00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,800
the right in a second and what we're

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,559
seeing there is what the data showing

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,959
basically a rough split between micro

00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,120
service applications and legacy Java

00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,519
applications maybe leaning more so

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,860
towards my cloud native applications if

00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:02,610
you include the 12 factor on the bottom

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,470
and the node j/s as well so it's kind of

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,939
both but more leaning towards cloud

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,740
native is that is that a correct read of

00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:08,150
this data

00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,190
and I love this slide because I think

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,840
we'd I personally made a lot of

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,300
assumptions about what people were using

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,680
containers for I think we you know

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,970
depending on the community that you're

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,670
in and the organization you're in you

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,530
make a lot of broad broad assumptions

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,210
around what people might use containers

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,620
for but it's interesting to see the

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,640
breakdown with cloud you know as you

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,060
said climate of application

00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:32,120
architectures taking the lead while

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,340
nearly half of them are still using them

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,620
for legacy Java applications we're still

00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,940
majority looking at cloud native

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,740
application architectures and that's

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,060
encouraging to me going back to my

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,560
prediction going forward is we're

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,360
starting to see that shift where more

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,870
people are using cloud native

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,920
application architectures in containers

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,360
particularly with microservices which

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,360
means more people are taking advantage

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,420
of the capability and the technology but

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,650
they're still also you know with

00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,000
specially with the large organizations

00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,890
trying to figure out what to do with the

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,600
legacy applications that they have you

00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,700
know can I move those to the cloud or

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,710
can I put those in a container can I

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,470
wrap them in AP eyes and make them

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,330
accessibility via services but building

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,010
out to micro services to take advantage

00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,420
of those and still be able to take

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,620
advantage of all the things containers

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,450
and cloud can give to me

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,880
right and so containers are fundamental

00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,710
to this transition as companies move

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,220
towards you know more cloud native

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,600
architectures also you know still trying

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,800
to deal with their legacy java apps that

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,270
containers are fundamental to the

00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,890
transition well containers are

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,750
fundamental to take an advantage of

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,980
cloud you know when we think about what

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,480
are the things you want when you want

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,220
move into the cloud you want the

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,050
elasticity you want scale you want the

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,330
ability to have flexibility with your

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,880
workload and containers allow you to

00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,950
have that with your application you can

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,390
move it you can use it you can scale it

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,960
out you can scale it up you can take

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:52,760
advantage of the cloud in that way and I

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,630
don't know that I messed up here and

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,950
advocate that by wrapping your existing

00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,510
legacy application or monolithic

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,370
application in a container and put it on

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,250
the cloud is going to magically provide

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:06,080
you cloud native properties but I do

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,660
think it is an important step towards

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,660
understanding value of container and if

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,220
you look at what some of these

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,020
organizations and people are using

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,730
containers for when I come back to

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,350
standardized deployments and

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,360
standardized environments I think ok

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,649
well this is a great first step and

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,600
building out continuous delivery

00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:25,640
practices and a great first step in

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,709
really understanding the value of cloud

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,750
toward your application workloads and

00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:31,220
and what about the right-hand side of

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,870
this graph that is those are the

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,899
languages people are using in their

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,600
containers that's that's a lot of Java

00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:39,829
it is a lot of Java what does that mean

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,200
what does that tell us how does that fit

00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:45,980
in with the story you're telling a lot

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,690
of Java out there I think there is a lot

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,140
of Java although I was excited to see

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:53,420
40% C++ so it looks like there's a

00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,829
tremendous amount of complex workloads

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,779
going into containers which is exciting

00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:59,690
but we're still looking at you know

00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:01,160
majority Java and I think as we look at

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,649
the majority of cloud native application

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,300
architectures that's the workloads with

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,160
majority of the language use cases being

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,250
Java we can sit we can assume that Java

00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,510
is primarily being used to develop these

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,940
micro services and cloud native

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,200
application architectures and I think

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,930
we've seen that in some of the other

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,910
data within some of the other

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,890
communities with the uptick and spring

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,170
and node and another and those other

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,519
community is spring and like and you

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,779
know the uptake and spring source and

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,699
then the ability of it and how it's

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:34,850
being used with microcircuitry illyrian

00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:36,579
forces that use case great and so I move

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,800
to the next slide and you had mentioned

00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:42,230
earlier about how larger enterprises are

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,990
taking advantage of containers and and

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,760
and using them to help you know to to

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,709
make use of their legacy Java apps and

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,779
what this slide shows the data here

00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:52,640
shows a nice progression you know the

00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:53,870
larger companies you know reinforcing

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,699
what you just said tend to be more

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,860
focused on the legs Java apps the

00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:58,970
smaller companies either because they

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,890
don't have them and they're they're

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,850
starting from from from scratch tend to

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,459
be more in the cloud native

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,740
architectures is is is that is that

00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,490
progression fit you know fit with what

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,350
you're what you're seeing and hearing

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,820
just reinforced the notion of you know

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,769
companies either straddling the two

00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,230
worlds or moving away from one world to

00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:17,480
the other world you know how do you see

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,570
how do you see this data broken down by

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,380
enterprise well it's not large giant

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,430
giant

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:29,779
excuse me giant enterprise nomenclature

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:31,520
the giant enterprises I don't think any

00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,750
of you would be surprised with the fact

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,000
that

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,490
those organizations that are running

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,560
legacy Java applications in containers

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,090
are predominantly giant enterprises I

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,180
don't think anyone would be surprised by

00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:47,270
that data I do think it's interesting

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,370
that still 34% of those giant

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,740
enterprises are working with micro

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,150
service applications which going back to

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,350
where we started in terms of predictions

00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,990
and predicting the future

00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,250
I think III would wager than the next

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:02,530
six to twelve months we'll start seeing

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:05,900
that number increase and either the

00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:08,300
legacy either stagnating or decreasing

00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,100
as they're making more use of micro

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,130
service applications to take advantage

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:17,030
of legacy data as they I hate to use the

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:19,070
word bimodal IT but realistically if you

00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:22,610
are a large enterprise or a giant

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,710
enterprise you are not going to ditch

00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,200
your legacy environment and move

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,180
directly to cloud native tomorrow there

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,480
is going to be a shift just like digital

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,140
transformation for for super enterprises

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,820
is taking it will take a long time and

00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,290
you know digital transformation takes

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,720
five to seven years for large

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,790
organizations and so I think will starts

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,410
will see that straddle for some time but

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,180
it's amazing to see how containers can

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,580
help bridge that they can provide that

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,260
scale they can provide that that

00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,020
entrance into continuous delivery

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,780
practices as you try to become a more

00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,460
software centric organization great

00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,110
thank you and thank you for jokes at my

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,570
expense I always appreciate that the

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,550
final slide here this one strikes me as

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,040
super interesting so maybe we saved the

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,510
best for last especially interesting for

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,430
anyone not buried under a rock who

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,140
doesn't you know hasn't missed all the

00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,939
buzz about kubernetes and and Mises

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,140
which has been what all that all the

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,730
news has been about when I look at this

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,120
slide that the data here what we're

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,010
seeing on the left is data showing how

00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,010
people say they are managing their

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,110
containers broadly well and what we're

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,270
seeing is near majority forty forty nine

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,190
percent are using either self-managed or

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,320
provider managed platform as a service

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,230
to manage their containers with a much

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,730
smaller share only 11% now saying

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,310
they're using self manage orchestration

00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,160
tools kubernetes and me dos and the like

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:44,690
and in on the right hand side we're

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,840
seeing you know pretty pretty strong

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,659
uptake of coup Burnett

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,830
if you include chorus tectonic within

00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:51,090
the orchestration tools but the

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,429
orchestration tools are actually still a

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,010
small space and mostly people are

00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:59,340
managing their their containers using

00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,480
platform-as-a-service in in politics I

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,100
live in a world where perception is

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,470
reality that clearly is not the case

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,120
here because the perception is all about

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,059
kubernetes kubernetes kubernetes that's

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,289
not what the what the data seems to show

00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,940
so anecdotally you were talking earlier

00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,559
anecdotally you know containers are

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,480
everywhere but maybe they're not

00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:19,409
anecdotally kubernetes everywhere maybe

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:22,799
it's not how many of you in here I've

00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:25,950
heard of kubernetes how many of you have

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:34,140
heard of mazes how many of you were

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:35,640
actually using it either right so the

00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,980
point of this and the point of that

00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,630
exercise was to really articulate that

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,909
it has captured a lot of market buzz

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,559
these these orchestration tools there's

00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:44,970
been a proliferation of them and they

00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,880
have escalated particularly over the

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,770
last six months you know we've seen you

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,510
know kubernetes scale and grow in terms

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,520
of brand awareness and marketing and

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,260
messaging as well as outreach which you

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,840
know I will be the first say that it's

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,270
an amazing tool as well as mezzos but

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,120
there was this perception that they had

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:05,490
taken over and were gaining and mass

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,899
adoption but when we look at the people

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,330
that are using containers we look at

00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:12,419
people that are using containers and are

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:15,419
trying to use containers at scale that

00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:18,090
that penetration within the market was

00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,039
not there and and that's important not

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,299
to say that I'm undermining the value of

00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,740
kubernetes and mezzos because I'm not

00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,210
because I think they're they're great

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,950
technologies in their own right

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,840
but when we look at organizations that

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,649
are contemplating running containers at

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,870
scale and they're looking at running

00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:37,760
containerized workloads in large

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:41,970
particularly large and giant enterprises

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,080
that have other needs and other aspects

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,789
that they have to be worried about like

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,860
security compliance health monetary and

00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,539
health management routing identity

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,340
management you know all of these things

00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,870
that they have to worry about they start

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,580
looking to platforms to help them manage

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,580
and manage that scale and manage that

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,919
that breadth of their organizations and

00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,190
and maintain the availability needs that

00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,300
they were

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,920
choir great thank you for that now we

00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,740
only have a few minutes left so I

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,210
thought I'd pause here instead of

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,680
following up and ask if anyone in the

00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,140
audience has any questions they'd want

00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,620
to ask to Abby or of me but presumably

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:30,240
Abby if anybody has any questions open

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:32,370
it up please so the question is how

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,480
would the the graph on the right look if

00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,330
you broke it down by company size

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,340
including giant enterprise well first

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,530
first I'll pass it off to Abby in a

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,480
second but first of all it's a very

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,300
small sample size the people on the

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,550
right that's only 58 no excuse me 61

00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,650
people so breaking that out by company

00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:53,700
size we're getting into very qualitative

00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:55,650
anecdotal level my my hunch is probably

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,500
less valuable than Abby's hunch in terms

00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,870
of your anecdotal understanding

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,980
different companies well mr. data tells

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,780
you that I shouldn't even be talking

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,730
about it but what's your anecdotal take

00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,440
about this Abby since since the day I

00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,030
can pull up the data but it's very grain

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,440
grain of salt level data so anecdotally

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,730
as you talk because you talk to folks

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,260
all across the industries you talk to

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,840
him what is your sense where do you see

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,130
more kubernetes uptake my instinct would

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,840
be it would be these these smaller

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,070
companies more nimble companies when

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,140
we've done focus groups around the world

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,120
Beijing or what have you you know we get

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,010
a sense that the the enterprise level

00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,630
they're worried about you know the

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,980
maturity level of these companies so

00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,030
maybe their focus more on a platform is

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,630
that way you're hearing because that's

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,550
what I'm hearing

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,620
but you talk to more industry industry

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:39,840
insiders so maybe you're you've got

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:41,640
different insights I feel like and I've

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,510
said this in a lot of different panels

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,000
in a lot of different ways but

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,200
essentially I feel like there is it

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
comes back to the right tool for the

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,170
right job and I think there's a place

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,430
for meso so I think there's a place for

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,290
kubernetes and I think there's a place

00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,140
for a platform like cloud foundry and

00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,030
oftentimes all in the same organization

00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,770
because it's entirely dependent on what

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,470
you're trying to do and the scale at

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:04,260
what you're trying to run I know

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:07,440
anecdotally there are many large

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:10,950
organizations or super organizations

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,660
that are that are running all three and

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,870
they're running all three in tandem and

00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,670
there

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,830
using them for very different things and

00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,990
I think we'll continue to see that for

00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,030
some time because I think we're starting

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:25,260
to see them all shake out to offer very

00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:26,820
different specialities for mezzos you

00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,340
know we've seen a lot of use cases where

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,530
customers that have needs for state are

00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:34,080
using that in tandem for our smaller

00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,910
workloads or stateful requirement and I

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,160
think you know for kubernetes there

00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,920
there might be case for specific

00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,770
protocol requirements and so I think you

00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:46,470
know the technology is all evolving all

00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:50,040
three are actually more cuz I probably

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,720
shouldn't forget docker all of them are

00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,550
evolving and are evolving at a really

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:58,890
rapid rate and I think the technology

00:22:53,550 --> 00:23:00,420
and I think about it almost as a line we

00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,790
have the technology evolving at a rate

00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,530
but then in parallel to that we have

00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:06,870
what we've talked about here with the

00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:09,390
platforms and the users the users are

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,700
evolving at a rate to so as we're seeing

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,050
this uptick in usage of containers and

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,970
that is we're seeing the uptick of use

00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,620
of cloud native application

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,940
architectures all the sudden you're

00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,020
developing more apps and you're getting

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,580
more speeding you're getting more

00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,670
traction and your needs change and that

00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,380
and that continues to evolve and the ask

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:28,620
is gonna be different of the technology

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,170
and I mean as we think about where we

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:34,200
are today at the end of September we're

00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:35,850
so far away from where we were in q1 of

00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,350
this year and where the technology was

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,360
and where the users were and I think

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:43,710
we'll continue to see that evolve and

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,630
you know my prediction right now is that

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,940
we'll see that evolve you know probably

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,650
every quarter if not every six months at

00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,200
an almost exponential rate in terms of

00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,240
the shift and the adoption thank you for

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,800
the question we have maybe another

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,309
minute or two we could squeeze another

00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,740
question if anybody else has a question

00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:06,170
two questions another two questions if

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,170
not I have one Bueller yes

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,490
[Music]

00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,530
that is so the question is are there

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,420
people that don't understand don't

00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:21,230
realize they're running containers that

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:23,090
is a very fair question my my instinct

00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,590
because it's it's almost impossible to

00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,670
ask that question do you realize that

00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,670
you're using something you're not using

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:37,700
do you realize you're using something

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:39,559
you're not using yes remind me how we

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,170
phrase the question do you realize using

00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:44,780
so you understand what you're using

00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,360
well can you define it well so what I do

00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,720
so we do ask in every survey so we ask

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,820
people to define certain terms do they

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,650
understand certain terms and we in

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,210
particularly have a hard time with

00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,530
platform-as-a-service which we define at

00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,150
the beginning of every survey because

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,070
people have a different definition of

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,540
platform-as-a-service whose AWS platform

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:07,429
well not really but as you know platform

00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:09,350
like features etc and so we we know

00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:12,260
going into this that that it's a very

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:14,330
fuzzy space already so we know there's

00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,100
going to be a subset of people in this

00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,110
that that either think they are or don't

00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,880
think they are we asked a question in

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,800
this survey that's not included here we

00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,480
asked a battery of questions about is

00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,309
this deployment where there's eight of

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,350
us or a juror or coffin or is this a

00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:30,020
platform service or is it something else

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,910
and you you find a large share of people

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,320
saying it abuse as a passing equally

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,730
large share people saying it's not a

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,740
pass in fact a larger share of saying a

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:41,900
verse in my past point being you have a

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:44,990
broad range of a fuzzy range of answers

00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,010
so my instinct is that yes there are a

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,630
lot of people using containers that

00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,010
don't realize that using containers and

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:53,960
probably some people who think they are

00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:55,490
that aren't anything add no I think you

00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,690
know that I think it was super

00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,250
interesting in their research we did

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,950
earlier in the year that there were a

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,330
lot of people that were using a platform

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,750
but then when asked to define it they

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,910
didn't under they compared it against

00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,500
things that were not a platform and I

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,270
think the same can be true of containers

00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,150
and it's just going back to where we

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,720
started we use a lot of words in our

00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,750
industry

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,009
and to quote Duncan when you're using

00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,820
that word and I don't think you know

00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:23,190
what that means

00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,809
we talked about that a lot because we

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,450
talked about micro-services containers

00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:29,039
cloud native 12 factor app you know we

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,360
we dropped those terms all that's all

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,399
those times I dropped those terms all

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,259
the time but then we as we reach out to

00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:35,580
people that are actually using and

00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,100
running these things in organizations

00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,720
and I think they're still struggling

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,830
with I don't really understand what that

00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,830
means and what that doesn't mean and

00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,460
respect to me okay thanks for the

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,460
question

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,470
thanks Alex so we're at 2 after is there

00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,059
session in here after us are you all

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,460
coming in for another session after this

00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:55,649
one just trickling in that's it he's not

00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,669
a yes he's nodding yes so probably even

00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:59,490
though no one's kicked us off we should

00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:02,129
probably leave are you here for this

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:04,080
fantastic oh you are here so you're

00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:04,559
kicking us off alright so then then

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,899
that's that

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,330
you know I'm happy to answer additional

00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:12,509
questions anyone has any ABI I'm sure is

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,769
got a million things to - after but come

00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:15,760
find us after we're around thank you

00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:18,549
very much for attending

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,549
