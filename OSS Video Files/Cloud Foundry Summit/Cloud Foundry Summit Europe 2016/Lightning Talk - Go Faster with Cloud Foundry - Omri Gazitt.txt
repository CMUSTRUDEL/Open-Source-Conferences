	Lightning Talk - Go Faster with Cloud Foundry - Omri Gazitt, Vice President and General Manager, Cloud Native Platform, Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Every Enterprise is contending with becoming more agile and learning how to build and deploy more applications at a faster cadence.  Cloud Foundry is the industry-standard open source ecosystem that enables HPE’s customers to realize the order-of-magnitude agility benefits across private, managed, and public clouds via Helion Stackato, our Cloud Foundry platform.

I want to start this talk where I start

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,589
every talk which is from the point of

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,780
view of our customers every CIO we

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,230
talked to tells us that they face the

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,960
twin imperatives of going faster and

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,970
doing it for less agility and efficiency

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,010
although sometimes they call it

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,160
different things my new favorite phrase

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:27,660
is the square of despair I'm gonna start

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,010
using that one agility to them means

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,619
that they have to go build more

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,930
applications and do it on a faster

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,480
cadence than ever before just to keep up

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,510
with their competition now they looked

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,280
at cloud computing as the answer but

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,230
what is cloud computing to them it

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,050
really is a combination of several

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,140
drivers each one of them representing an

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:53,010
order of magnitude improvement over

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,050
traditional or legacy IT now one of

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,590
these drivers were born in the in the

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,329
public cloud but every business that we

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,219
talk to you wants to realize these

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,159
benefits whether they're running that

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,740
our infrastructure on public clouds or

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,979
in their private clouds on their own

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,350
infrastructure now taken together all

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,080
these drivers all these order of

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,549
magnitude improvements really confer

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,280
upon the people we use them an

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,710
insurmountable competitive advantage

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,330
over the ones who don't and that is the

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,790
business case that's driving the

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,329
transformation to a hybrid cloud

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,270
platform for our customers let's dive

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,700
into some of these specific drivers the

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,790
first is the move to empower developers

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,950
with a self-service experience gone are

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,280
the days where developers kind of throw

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,920
code over the fence to operators who

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,720
then take weeks or maybe even longer to

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,640
go provisional into those applications

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,790
now developers have a self-service

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,920
experience for doing that in minutes

00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:59,460
next is automation the idea of offering

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,090
the platform capabilities as REST API s

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,790
so that developers can script them and

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,770
automate the replication of running

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,349
systems in minutes as opposed to doing

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,780
it in a manual and error-prone way over

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,819
days and once you have these two things

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,569
you can build

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,390
continuous integration continuous

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,310
delivery pipelines or CI CD pipelines

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,310
which are really basically automating

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,709
the build test deploy cycle for

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,590
developers once you actually drive down

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:31,379
the cycle time and are able to deploy

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,260
applications many times a week that

00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,879
means that you can learn faster what

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,040
your customers want and you can move

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,530
faster and then finally to move to a

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,680
micro services architecture from these

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,690
monolithic systems enables you to go

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,400
stitch together applications from

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,069
discrete components over well-defined

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,989
api's and micro services and containers

00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,159
go hand-in-hand

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:55,109
containers brewed up in seconds as

00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:56,819
opposed to minutes that VMs take to boot

00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,980
up and you can run hundreds of them on a

00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,879
server compared to only tens of VMs

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,569
again order of magnitude improvements

00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:07,829
now all these taken together again Drive

00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,239
insurmountable competitive advantages

00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:15,239
for businesses who use them over

00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:19,049
businesses who don't now we chose cloud

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,030
foundry as the past framework for

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:24,060
unlocking these benefits for our

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,699
customers because cloud foundry is the

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,090
industry standard multi-vendor

00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:32,190
open source pads platform and ecosystem

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,919
we've been a member of the cloud foundry

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,139
foundation since its inception as a

00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,970
Platinum founding member and we've taken

00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:46,199
a deep dependency on cloud foundry in

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:50,069
our products and Helion staccato is our

00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:52,199
multi cloud enterprise grade cloud

00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,079
native application platform the product

00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,209
is now in its fifth year and version

00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,909
four o which is shipping in just a few

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,769
short weeks is going to be a hundred

00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:04,049
percent cloud foundry foundation

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,639
certified back to Sam's point about

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:09,479
certification which we take very

00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,250
seriously so we'd like to help you go

00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,650
faster with cloud foundry and staccato

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,289
and help you realize those order of

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,229
magnitude improvements to agility that

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,789
come from the cloud come find us at our

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:23,760
booth and maybe I'll even do some

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,900
martial arts demonstrations there thank

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,520
you

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,520
