	Windows Containers: The Step in Creating Linux/Windows Parity in Cloud Foundry - Stefan Schneider & Vlad Iovanov, HPE Helion

The current sandboxing technologies used in the Windows Diego cells are quite different from their Linux counterparts. Luckily, Microsoft is narrowing the gap. 

The presenters will walk the audience through the new containerization technologies available in the latest server versions of Microsoft Windows and how they can be used in conjunction with Windows Diego Cells. 

They will also be demonstrating Cloud Foundry running on Windows Diego Cell implementation that uses these new technologies in Windows Server release.
