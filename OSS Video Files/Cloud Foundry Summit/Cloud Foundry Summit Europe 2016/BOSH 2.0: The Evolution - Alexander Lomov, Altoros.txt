	BOSH 2.0: The Evolution - Alexander Lomov, Altoros

BOSH 2.0 is not what most people think it is. It is not a major release of BOSH, and, in fact, not a version at all. BOSH 2.0 is a set of concepts, features, and ideas designed to improve and evolve the BOSH project. In this talk, Alexander will share with you the most exciting and useful upcoming and existing BOSH features, give you a tour to the internals, and show how new changes appear in the project. He will also highlight the main driving forces of the BOSH evolution, describe the role of the Concourse project in this process, show how we can influence the direction in which BOSH is moving. BOSH 2.0 is almost out, so be ready to get the most of it!
