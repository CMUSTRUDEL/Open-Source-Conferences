	Public Cloud Foundry Platforms in Europe: What Have We Learned and Where Can We Go Next? - Moderated by Dan Young, EngineerBetter

Public Cloud Foundry platforms form an essential part of the ecosystem and a useful on-ramp for new users. This panel will explore the operational lessons that have been learned from running CF at scale and find out how enterprises are using public CF for production apps. What features would service providers like in CF and what would users like to see from their providers? Finally, what non-technical factors are at play in the often complex European market and how can the community work to build better public PaaS for this region?

To discover more about public CF come and meet Marco Hochstrasser (Head of Cloud Platform, Swisscom), Julian Fischer (CEO, Anynines), Jonathan Matthews (Principal Engineer, M&S Digital), Dominic Harries (Lead Developer, IBM Bluemix Garage) and Colin Humphreys (CTO for Cloud, Pivotal). The panel is moderated by Dan Young (CEO, EngineerBetter)
