	Five Years Delivering World-Class Business Critical Apps on Cloud Foundry – Tim Savage & Ben Fry, Armakuni

Armakuni has worked with Comic Relief to transform the legacy donations platform into a secure, highly scalable and resilient, micro-service platform that caters for over 100,000 concurrent web sessions and up to 500 payments/second.  At the same time, Armakuni was able to reduce the team size by 90% and save iro £5m run costs.  This presentation will walk-through the journey, analyse the key decisions along the way, and discuss the benefits gained by a move to Cloud Native and why Cloud Foundry was key to the initial success and remains critical to the on-going success of the platform, and is now being adopted across the wider technology function.

Comic Relief is the UK-based charity responsible for ‘Red Nose Day’; seven hours of primetime live TV with circa 26 million viewers raising over a billion pounds in five years. 

About Ben Fry
I am truly excited by the possibilities of cloud native and Cloud Foundry and the potential it has to enable organisations to design, build, deploy and run software solutions the way they should be, breaking free from all the complexities and constraints associated with traditional methods and technologies.

About Tim Savage
Tim has been delivering technology across many industry sectors for the past 20 years, most recently working on high volume/transaction web platforms. He formed Armakuni in 2012 with colleagues to provide a platform through which to deliver business critical systems but applying new methodology. Armakuni use new technologies such as PaaS to enable truly agile delivery.
