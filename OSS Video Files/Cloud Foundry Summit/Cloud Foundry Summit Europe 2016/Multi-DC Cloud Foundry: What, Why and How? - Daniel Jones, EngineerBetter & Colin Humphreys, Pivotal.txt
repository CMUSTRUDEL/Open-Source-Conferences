	Multi-DC Cloud Foundry: What, Why and How? - Daniel Jones, EngineerBetter & Colin Humphreys, Pivotal

What are the fundamental choices that need to be made when running Cloud Foundry in more than one data centre, and what tools can help operators deal with the compromises that CAP theorem enforces? In this talk Colin Humphreys details the deployment models of Cloud Foundry, and explains that whilst it’s possible to keep apps running and available in a multi-data centre deployment, operators face a compromise of increased operational overhead if they want to be able to continue changing the state of their PaaS in the event of an outage. Daniel Jones then shows some of the open source tooling that helps manage the operational complexity required by those wishing to operate a highly-available multi-data centre Cloud Foundry installation.
