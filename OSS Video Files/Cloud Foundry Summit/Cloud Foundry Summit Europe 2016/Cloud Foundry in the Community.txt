Publication date: 2016-09-30
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2016
Description: 
	Cloud Foundry in the Community - Kim Bannerman, IBM; Lukas Lehmann, Swisscom; Paula Kennedy, Pivotal; and Stormy Peters, Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry is more than an open source platform; it’s a growing community! In the past two years, our community has grown by leaps and bounds as a result of very passionate and dedicated people as well as crucial community tools like GitHub, Slack, and Twitter. Cloud Foundry meet-ups foster a collaborative, inclusive environment focused on new releases, best practices, and how customers are using Cloud Foundry.  Come meet Cloud Foundry organizer for Seattle and Atlanta Kim Bannerman of IBM, London organizer Paula Kennedy of Cloud Credo/Pivotal, and Lukas Lehmann of Swisscom (Swisscom helps to organize the CF Community across the EU). Moderated by Stormy Peters, VP of Advocacy for the Cloud Foundry Foundation. The panel will discuss lessons learned, what 2016 looks like for the Cloud Foundry community.

	00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,520
so good afternoon or good morning

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,690
depending on what time zone you're in so

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,760
this is gonna be our panel about Cloud

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,290
Foundry community and in particular it's

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,610
about the Cloud Foundry meetup community

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,940
which is a very strong part of our

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,990
community there are 176 meetups last

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,580
time I like to think there's more now

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,260
around the world

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,369
I thought about sense starting one in

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,410
Antarctica just so we could say there

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,430
was one in every continent I have a

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,369
friend that goes down there once a year

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,199
but it's a very diverse community it's

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,359
run by a lot of different people from

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,489
lots of different organizations we're

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,500
gonna share best practices as you'll see

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:35,610
the best practices vary so you should

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,890
and your own meetup or your own

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,710
community you should take the best ideas

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,510
here and try them out at home so first

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,370
show hands before we get started how

pivotal Amir's and based in the London

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,739
office of pivotal I used to run a

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,540
company called cloud credo which I

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,510
founded in 2012 with Colin Humphrey

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,849
and and when we were kind of within

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,980
cloud cuida we started our own meetup

00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:23,950
group which was the london platform as a

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,379
service user group and which we founded

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:32,140
in 2012 as well and we still run it

00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:34,329
today you know my name is lukas loon and

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,220
we're Swisscom i'm a proctor owner of

00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:39,459
our application cloud that's our

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,310
platform as a service offering and we

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:46,870
found that cloud foundry Meetup user

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:49,150
group for the dark region in 2014 right

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,879
after the cloud foundry summit in San

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,389
Francisco and I'm mainly organizing

00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:58,209
meetups within Switzerland

00:02:54,389 --> 00:03:00,189
thank you all for joining us I didn't

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,599
introduce myself I'm stormy Peters I'm I

00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:03,310
used to run developer relations for the

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,989
foundation and I'm volunteering in this

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,250
role I'm still working primarily on

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,409
cloud foundry ambassadors

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,790
I haven't organized a meet-up I go to my

00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:11,019
local meetup I haven't organized a

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,970
meet-up but I used to offer to send

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,700
t-shirts or swag or anything any meetup

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,900
organizer wanted so I can't send new

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,889
that's why but I can find someone who

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,000
can if you need it for your local meetup

00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:24,129
I'm so with that I thought we just start

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,900
with some questions um and just kind of

00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:28,150
the easy one to start like what works

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,979
really well in your community what what

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,470
do you think your community your meetup

00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:34,060
does particularly well um that if you

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,829
were gonna give one piece of advice to

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,449
someone starting a meetup or someone

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:41,799
trying to revamp their meetup what would

00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:43,540
that be and read anyone okay I guess

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,109
I'll start

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,549
so my me took is slightly different from

00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:51,010
some of the other meetups you describe

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:52,900
so as is the platform as-a-service

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,329
kind of user group so we're not just

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,579
focused on Cloud Foundry although

00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,079
admittedly we're slightly biased and we

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:02,709
have a lot of Cloud Foundry based talks

00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:06,189
I think the thing that I have found that

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,829
works well for us is we are we try to be

00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:11,159
consistent with when we have our meetup

00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:14,590
and we try to schedule it regularly so

00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,269
people in our community kind of expect

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,430
that we'll have a meetup towards the end

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,560
of the month normally on a Thursday and

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,389
we try to have one a month and it's

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,419
typically in the same location so we run

00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,500
it in the pivotal office and I think

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,330
having that consistent

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,600
it's sort of on the calendar and I've

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,800
had a future a few cases where I've had

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,480
to pick up on a different day because

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,770
the speaker couldn't come and then

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,030
someone said to me why did you change it

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,770
to Monday because it's always on a

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,660
Thursday and they sort of have it in

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,090
their mind that that's what it is and I

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,160
think by having it regularly and in the

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,930
back of people's minds that way we get

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,280
more people coming because they they

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:52,300
sort of know when they expect it to

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,210
happen you know what works particularly

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,180
well within our meetup group is the

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,920
content it's really really about the

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,440
content if you if you have a meet about

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,900
Micra a meet-up about micro services or

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,050
docker then we have a may way more

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,990
people in where it's just a random Cloud

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,840
Foundry topic so we really see that

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,610
people check out the schedule and check

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,880
what speaker is there and what the topic

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:32,800
is that there are errors weepy so we

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:35,350
really take care of the content exactly

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,780
suck how can I use doctor uncle foundry

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,700
what are my restrictions or also how do

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,919
I need to design my application that it

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,820
works in a cloud foundry and what is

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,250
also very important point is to get the

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,290
lessons learned from other customers or

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,020
other users from Cloud Foundry it's like

00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,300
what was your experience between where

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,360
did you struggle what can we do to avoid

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,990
struggling so that they really can

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,010
profit from it early on when we were

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,320
just getting off the ground it was

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,510
helpful for us to cross post with other

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,100
meetup organizers and so I encourage if

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,840
you're organizing something or you're

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,310
thinking of it to get to know all the

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,680
other meetup group organizers and

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,440
applicable technologies so example for

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,550
us was DevOps and docker and a couple of

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,020
their different topics that played

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,669
really well with cloud foundry and so

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,330
that's how we got our attendee base kind

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:26,800
of going and so then people are starting

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,270
starting anything I always go out and

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,860
look for advice and I'm sure when you

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,410
started out if you ask you've got tons

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,210
of advice and the world changes and

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,200
different communities are different in

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,000
different things work

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,090
I was curious what's the best advice you

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,590
got that didn't

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,419
like I know you said like doctors not a

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,190
hot topic in Seattle as much anymore

00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:44,690
like what's what's the piece of advice

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,530
you got when you started that sounded

00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:52,220
great and it just didn't work for you so

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,690
when we founded cloud credo and a piece

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,010
of advice that I was given was if you

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,440
run a meter it's a great place to

00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,630
recruit new people it's like a you know

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,600
a recruitment kind of hotbed of

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,710
developers we never in the history of

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,650
lacquer you know hired one person

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,150
through our meetup group and it was one

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,370
of those things where like I really

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,500
enjoy doing the meetup and it's a lot of

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,180
fun but we've never actually recruited a

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:22,340
single person on the basis of having

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:25,220
done that meetup group but we also see

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,470
on on our side on hiring I can't agree

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,880
there we have actually hired and met

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,639
some people which are now working with

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,070
us on our meetup so there was quite a

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,350
good one what was not working out for us

00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,560
was or what I think is not working out

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:42,050
this the meetup is called cloud foundry

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,000
user group for the dark region so it's

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,460
for the whole region of Germany Austria

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,500
and Switzerland and that region is too

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,350
big for a meetup group so I really

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,419
recommend to a meetup group local

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,039
somewhere I mean Switzerland is local

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,960
enough to just have one for the whole

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,820
country but otherwise just for the city

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,530
like you have with London focus there

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,510
someone told me to have in Seattle

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,979
there's two different areas so there's

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,180
Seattle which is a lot of the startup

00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:10,010
some of the bigger companies are in

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,070
downtown Seattle but there's also an

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,660
east side which is where Microsoft and

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,490
some of the Google offices are in

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,789
different offices in general and so they

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:22,400
said do every other month do east side

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:24,350
in Seattle and just alternate but that

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,520
people we were we were losing attendees

00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,470
people that were in Seattle wouldn't

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,030
come to the east side but the east side

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,860
would come to Seattle so we just ended

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,080
up keeping it and see have a proper

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,789
after a while just created twice as much

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,000
work how exactly the traffic and

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,020
everything so yeah please I'll repeat

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,490
the question if you could say it as loud

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,909
as you could and then I'll repeat for

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,909
the recording

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,550
so the most knowing thing from an

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,650
attendee perspective is a meet up with

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,650
no content so please have good content

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:23,510
any any other advice he doesn't have any

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:24,830
opinions at all right so at any time if

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,430
anyone has a question or a piece of

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,430
input yep

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,240
so the question is can it be too often

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,610
and is once a month too often like do

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,370
you lose attendees that way that's a

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,110
good question

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,760
it's a lot of work let me be clear it's

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,370
a lot of hard work to run it once a

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,370
month the hardest thing is actually

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,470
trying to find the speakers and just

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,750
make sure that the content to your point

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,430
is actually relevant the people in the

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,110
community care about it that you're not

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,470
just creating a slot and then having to

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,810
fill it what I try to do I do two things

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,670
what I do is I one one every month like

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,530
I say I don't do one in August because

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,240
in Europe everyone's on holiday in

00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,310
August and I don't do one in December

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,690
because it's Christmas and people are

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,000
busy doing Christmas parties so

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,360
therefore I do ten I aim to do ten a

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,340
year I do one minor vembur Meetup we

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,200
typically do lightning talks so we just

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,970
have some fun so we have maybe five or

00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,770
six speakers doing short talks and

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,170
that's always quite a good fun event and

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,300
then for the other ones

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,440
it is difficult I mean you know like I

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,170
said the challenge are trying to find

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,330
speakers and you might get one one event

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,100
where you have you know 100 people will

00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,910
show up because that particular content

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,130
that you've got or that particular

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,300
speaker that you manage to book you know

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,190
is really popular when ever wants to

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,860
come and then the next month maybe you

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,230
get 15 people come but I I look at it as

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,690
even though I find it hard work to do

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,340
it's also whether it's it's kind of that

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,050
that principle of kind of the open space

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,970
like whoever comes that was the right

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,100
number of people so if you have an event

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,840
only five people come well those were

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,510
the right five people you know they come

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,760
they talk their network they build that

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,080
community it doesn't really bother me

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,940
that much whether I get a hundred or

00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:27,680
five if I've if I've run it and they've

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:31,060
come that was kind of meant to be so so

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,260
along with that question um why do you

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,520
you know Kim why did you start the

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,410
communities like what makes you

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,210
passionate about it and why do you think

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,890
it's necessary to or why do you think

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,260
meetups are important part of the Cloud

00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,870
Foundry outreach strategy when I started

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,100
it years ago I was in sales and so I was

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,150
never one of those traditional people

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,440
that had to have a sales engineer

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,570
attached to me all the time I always

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,190
want to understand the technology and so

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,170
when I started helping out with spring

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,330
and then I started the Hadoop user group

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,970
in Atlanta I wanted to understand the

00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,590
Under

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,690
technology and so it was an easy way for

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,100
me because I don't I can read release

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,650
notes but it was easier for me to learn

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,360
by hearing and doing and seeing and

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,430
having questions and a meet up

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,050
environment so if that's why I first

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,230
start good I started doing it for Cloud

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:15,300
Foundry you know I feel like it's it's

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,920
such a positive community and why I stay

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,240
in it even though that's not my core

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,690
focus at IBM

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:27,030
it's because I love it so so we've kept

00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:30,120
you Congrats so Lucas wait what what

00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:33,180
makes you do it yeah for me it's really

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,600
get to know new people and also get to

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,610
new get to know new inputs and I often

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,980
think then when we see new concepts or

00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,170
discuss about new concepts it's just

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,150
really the view that it can be what do

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,970
others people what other people think

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:51,030
about it and really get that valuable

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:53,130
input and have that discussion also the

00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,170
upper and the vier discussions that are

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,570
very great on that meet ups and that

00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,690
really makes me passionate about doing

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:02,730
it I mean I think with with the meetup

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,160
group that I do like I say because we

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,770
are a platform as a service user group

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,560
some of the most interesting kind of

00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,640
meetups we have a where we invite

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,830
basically kind of competition for

00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,090
pivotal to come in and present you know

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:19,230
what they're doing or what's interesting

00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,880
for those other companies and it's a it

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,890
gives us an insight into kind of what

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,720
else is going on but you know Cloud

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,070
Foundry is a community in it to me it

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,960
doesn't really matter whether it's in a

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,250
pivot or Cloud Foundry whether it's IBM

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,170
bluemix doesn't really matter kind of

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,990
the vendor it's just interesting to hear

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,630
other Cloud Foundry stories how people

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,340
are using it you know what's going on in

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,930
the world of cloud foundry and also like

00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,450
the other technologies like kubernetes

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,130
and me sauce and docker it's it's just

00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,390
interesting to find out what's going on

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,370
in our community what people are

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:52,290
interested in have them come in and talk

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:54,030
about it and so a question that wasn't

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,820
on my list of questions I apologized he

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,589
already when he started these

00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,900
communities how long does it take before

00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,370
you kind of felt like get a rhythm and

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,690
you had a nice group of attendees that's

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,089
coming so what would your advice to

00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,470
someone who is starting one like how

00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:08,960
long should they realize that it's gonna

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,920
take before they

00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,530
have a rhythm I think it takes a little

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,350
while I mean we started my first year of

00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:20,210
during lope ugh I think we ran them

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,490
probably only once to the question of

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,760
how frequent is too often we only ran a

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,520
meter probably once every six months and

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,050
because it wasn't frequent and people

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,360
didn't really know about it we started

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,970
off with only know fifteen to twenty

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,830
people and now we have I think nearly

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,190
nine hundred members and I use a group

00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:42,050
and I think you just have to for me the

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,790
best advice would be just keep doing it

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,320
as long as you're enjoying it as long as

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,450
a few people come as long as it's

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,910
interesting to you you know it will just

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:53,330
build up it's just about keeping going I

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:55,330
think yeah I think also for the

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,890
beginning it's very important that you

00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:00,920
co-organized with other meetups like

00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:04,160
docker or Microsoft microservice meetup

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,770
groups in in your town and then the

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,170
start I think that was was pretty easy

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,030
on our site to get some attendees

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,990
because you also get promoted from

00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:16,250
meetup comm for the first meetups and

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,990
others will get emails about there is a

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,390
new group and they will automatically

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,640
sign be some signups but it's more

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:26,350
important that what quality map all I

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:29,180
mentioned that you keep it going and

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,190
really organized on a regular basis

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,350
these meetups and search for the speaker

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,480
search for the venues and keep that

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,750
spirit going that is within that meetup

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,940
group probably took us three or four

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:45,020
months in Seattle to get repeatable

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,250
attendees and a lot of it is I'm super

00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,570
passionate about getting to know the

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,430
people that come to the meetups and

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,630
invite them back and remind you know not

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,040
necessarily remind me of them but say if

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,030
they're on Twitter is like hey can't

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,830
wait to see you next week hope you're

00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,070
gonna make it but really when we started

00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,720
having some pretty big high-profile

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,860
speakers was when you know people really

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,300
started coming and said oh this is

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,530
awesome you know and we're gonna have

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,910
someone that's more technical next week

00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,010
and not one of the original founders of

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,510
connery but you know join us and said

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,120
that really got a lot of uptake helping

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:13,550
for us I think it's also important to be

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,930
kind of sensitive to the community one

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,790
of the things I try and do when I'm

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,890
scheduling a meet-up is just check the

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,990
local meetup calendar not try and

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,060
compete with other meetup groups not

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,380
trying like schedules

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,750
on the same night as the mother big

00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,610
event and and if you want to start up a

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,890
meet-up in your own you know city or

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,960
town where you live maybe just see if

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,910
there are already kind of platform as a

00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,280
service user group or if there's a cloud

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,960
found your group there's no point in

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,460
kind of trying to compete if there's one

00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,110
already in existence maybe just contact

00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,810
the organizers see if you can contribute

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,070
see if you can help not kind of try and

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,410
form your new thing if there's already

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,330
one you know you could support in your

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,240
area it's definitely a cardinal rule of

00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:54,730
meetups you know please don't split the

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,920
community yeah and really do not

00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,680
hesitate to contact organizers they're

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,190
happy to to Co Co organize something we

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,190
shoot together

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,040
so the question is what's the advice on

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,830
level of content should you have

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,720
frequent beginner level quad funder 101

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,700
classes or she do deep dives in the

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,360
different Cloud Foundry aspects what

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,350
works well we vary those so for Atlanta

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,179
we're still getting that off the ground

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,790
even though we've been doing it for 2014

00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,740
since 2014 so we do a lot of the

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,570
frequent cloud finder of 101 thanks

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,549
because Lena was a little further behind

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,620
Seattle Seattle you know a lot of tech

00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:54,210
companies so I think it depends on your

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,429
environment for sure

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,020
but I do enjoy the deeper dive and we

00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:59,970
have had folks come in and do like many

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,590
workshops and we asked you to bring your

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,580
laptops and we're gonna do these things

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,130
we're gonna actually show you how to

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:08,610
work it so that gets a lot of people

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:10,919
coming back I think I think we do kind

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,980
of similar to Kim we try and mix it up

00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,740
so sometimes we have the like I say we

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,600
have different paths providers coming in

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,100
and then you end up with a bit more kind

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,809
of a vendor pitch and they'll talk to

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,419
you about what their platform

00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,070
as-a-service will do which can be

00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,799
interesting or less interesting

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,150
depending we've done different things as

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,370
well so like say we do a lightning talks

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,110
event once every year and that's always

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,610
a lot of fun so you get people talk and

00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,929
they'll talk about any subject it

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,750
doesn't have to be you know technology

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,640
related even it can be on anything and

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,380
they're always quite well attended and

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,790
then we've also run like a hackathon

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,410
which we've done on a Saturday and

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,600
people come in and they'll hack on a

00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:51,120
certain piece of Clara foundry so we've

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,520
done like a Diego hackathon which wasn't

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,110
well attended but was a lot of fun for

00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,419
those people that were there so we try

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:02,780
we ought to try mix it up you want to

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,780
follow up on that

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,279
so the question is what your policy or

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:19,730
attitude towards vendor present has a

00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:22,909
lot of opinions on those we are a

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,110
community first I worked happen to work

00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:25,880
for a company that actually has an

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,490
opinionated take on Cloud Foundry

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,830
however if you want to have that

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,690
discussion after and someone wants to

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,059
ask you about pivotal Cloud Foundry or a

00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,649
bluemix that's fine but if you're coming

00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:41,809
in to do a straight-up vendor pitch

00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:43,990
that's not what the meetups about yeah

00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:46,730
as I've seen the same we also had some

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:49,370
real vendor pitches and after that I

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:51,649
started to review the talks and review

00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:54,649
the slides up front just to go a little

00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:57,289
short about I mean one slide about what

00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:59,269
what they do no worse at the beers

00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:02,419
there's enough time to pitch it for sure

00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:06,590
but yeah it's not a place for a full

00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:08,120
sales stop on the content side the

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,070
Denver user group usually does two

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,440
presentations every night and so the

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,809
first one will be a talk like I I gave

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,970
like a Cloud Foundry foundation update I

00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:18,289
know like all states come in and digital

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,299
Globes come in talk about how they use

00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:22,010
not vendor pitches but like actually how

00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:23,360
they implemented Cloud Foundry and

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,130
they're quite honest about what's

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,899
working and not working so that goes

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,330
over really well and then their second

00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:30,320
talk is always a very technical talk by

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,389
someone from the Cloud Foundry

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,950
contributor team talking about what they

00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:37,760
did so they kind of balanced at every

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:39,590
meeting we tend to kind of invite people

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,250
and if they do a vendor pitch it's sort

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:45,440
of at their own risk because we quite

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,919
typically have Colin Humphreys who's our

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,720
co organizer and he will heckle and he

00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,639
will ask awkward questions

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,620
so vendors want to come in and do their

00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:56,510
kind of competitor to Cloud Foundry

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,490
pitch that's absolutely fine but it's

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,639
sort of at their own risk let's put it

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,639
that way

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,800
so so we've talked a lot about content

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,600
what's been so everyone who organizes a

00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,980
meet-up is always looking for speakers

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,540
and contents and I'll put up mailing

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,160
lists we have a CF speakers at Cloud

00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,990
Foundry mailing list that you can

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,790
actually post and say how this Meetup

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,220
any of you interested in speaking but

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:23,880
I'm curious what was your best most

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,380
engaged best talk like so everyone can

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,430
mob them afterwards and send them email

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,020
and ask them to come talk at their

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,690
Meetup

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:33,480
Josh McEntee he talked about his journey

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:36,240
from OpenStack and how he in into Cloud

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,920
Foundry and how it all tied together and

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,180
just because it's Josh you know a lot of

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,860
people wanted to meet him

00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,090
that was a huge talk the other thing if

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,670
you're talking about a technical talk it

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,140
was all around containers and it was

00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,970
just talking about the entire ecosystem

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,710
and we got from A to Z and how it plays

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,210
into cloud foundry use cases for each

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,450
one and that was pretty well attended

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,460
[Music]

00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:00,690
yeah with like half year ago we had

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,210
Colin Humphreys Zurich and he talked on

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,130
a retrospective phone sounds fun it was

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:12,690
it was pretty good I really recommend

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:14,790
him I think probably our most well

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,520
attended meetup has actually been when

00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,780
we done the lightning talks because when

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,010
you've got kind of six different

00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,290
speakers from six different companies

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,670
and they all invite their friends and

00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,890
their colleagues and they all come in

00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:27,240
and because there's typically what we've

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,820
tried to do when we've done that event

00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,800
is have something for everyone it then

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,750
seems to attract a wider audience and

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,610
then you get lots lots more people come

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,570
and you know I think that's that's

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:42,290
always been our most well attended of em

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,290
any questions from the audience

00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,890
so what's the format of the lightning

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:56,350
talks how many speakers and how long so

00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:59,110
we try to do between five and six

00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,880
speakers and depending on the number of

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,190
pieces of it sort of our total session

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,480
time would be let's say an hour but what

00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,180
we would normally do is try and have

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,560
let's say three and then a quick break

00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,870
so if I can get more drinks and more

00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,360
food and then another three talks each

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,280
lightning talk would be five minutes we

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,460
typically get mmm they maybe have a one

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,290
minute spare and it's off the stage so

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,480
but we're not strict when we do it we're

00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,160
not strict on you know you can only have

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,150
each slide every 15 seconds we don't

00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,890
have any kind of format like that you

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,750
can have as many slides as you want but

00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,750
you get five minutes and that's it

00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:51,110
how do you promote diversity of speaker

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:53,610
and attendees posting with other groups

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,960
in Seattle there's women in tech groups

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,840
there's that I'm involved in there's

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,100
also different startup groups that I'm

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,080
involved in that tend to have more

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,950
diversity and so that's that's worked

00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:07,350
well in the past for us yeah I often go

00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,450
directly to two people and ask them and

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,909
encourage them to speak at the meetup

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:15,059
give them the platform and have them to

00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:16,730
talk about what they're doing so we I've

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,720
done something similar to Lucas so we've

00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,730
particularly the Lightning talks we try

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,059
to encourage people that have not spoken

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:26,340
before because if you if you're not used

00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:28,620
to public speaking that five minute slot

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,809
is slightly less scary than a 20 minute

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,759
slot over 30 minute slot and so we

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:34,559
actually had a really good case I think

00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,090
it was two years ago when we ran it we

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,340
approached somebody who was in pivotal

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,289
to come and do a lightning talk and she

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,019
was very nervous she had not spoken

00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:44,669
before and then since then she's gone on

00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:46,019
to speak at lots of different

00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:47,580
conferences all around the world and

00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:49,440
she's fantastic and she came back

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,480
recently and did a half-an-hour talk at

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,039
our meetup group it was amazing her

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,960
confidence had built so much and just

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,029
from doing that one five minute

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,409
lightning talk she's gone on and spoken

00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:03,950
kind of all around the world any advice

00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:07,440
from the audience on any of these topics

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,730
anything I say any questions I always

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,299
have lots of questions so I go back to

00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:14,090
my questions my manda thought on the on

00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:16,230
the on the paid talks though is that

00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:18,210
nobody wants to give a talk that nobody

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,279
wants to listen to sigh I think being

00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,960
really blunt with people and saying you

00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:23,490
know great that you sponsor this thing

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,809
people will notice that but if you stand

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,889
up and give a product pitch they won't

00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:33,509
remember you else so we asked how you

00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:35,610
found speakers what are the signs that

00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:37,470
your community is doing well like how do

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,840
you know like so you started up this

00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,879
meetup it took three months to a year to

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,830
get it really going how did you know

00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:45,210
then that it was going well like is it

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:49,289
the number of attendees is that the

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:52,379
conversations you have I think for me

00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:55,139
it's when you see kind of similar faces

00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:56,669
and you see the regulars that come I

00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:57,600
mean it's always great to see new people

00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:59,039
come

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,049
but we've had a couple of cases where

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,610
people have come to our Meetup

00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:04,590
they've gotten to know each other and

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,530
the natural fats have then gone on to

00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,850
kind of form companies together so we've

00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,010
had a couple of kind of startup

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:13,080
companies that have basically been built

00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,760
out of they've gotten to know each other

00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,559
because they've come to the to our

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,049
meetup they've got a shared love for

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,640
Cloud Foundry they have ideas about what

00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:22,350
they want to do with it and so they're

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,750
gonna go off and start a business from

00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:28,350
it and I think to see that kind of

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,640
growth out of just our meetup group to

00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,049
me is a really great measure of success

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,340
like it looks like it's doing well

00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,710
because people are kind of getting

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:41,730
together outside of our meetup group and

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:44,100
starting companies that's you bring the

00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:47,070
number of attendees yet that's always an

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:50,610
indicator for sure but there's Paula

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:53,460
said regularly the regularity and if you

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,970
see the same people returning to your

00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,059
meetup

00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:59,340
I have the conversations and then yeah

00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:01,980
you can also build up some trust you see

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:05,130
their locality this really is for me a

00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,690
good sign for a healthy community what

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,480
makes me happy is when attendees become

00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,370
speakers you know and that that's always

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,169
a sign of super engage you know

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,090
community that's happening and then when

00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:16,559
everyone when we have to leave the space

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,210
and they're closing it down and everyone

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,620
wants to grab beer after you know that's

00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,530
how you know it you know we've got a

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,390
good little ecosystem going yes that

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,549
then always when the beer starts not

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,830
people just taking one beer and the left

00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:33,049
we're often there for hours and just

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,049
talking exactly discussions yep

00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:45,900
getting together discussing ideas that

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:50,550
can arise and the content force is very

00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:53,400
important with what we do at our meto we

00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:56,580
always have one goal and you try to keep

00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,470
it a bit short so there's content that

00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:09,000
can be context to the conversation but

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:18,480
it's all about the conversation so what

00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:19,950
your meetup which meetup do you run and

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,180
so you said for the back the ring I

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,160
might not hear that the most important

00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,470
part of your meetup is the is the social

00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,640
social aspect of it and so the content

00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,640
is to get the conversation going

00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,570
Thanks

00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:57,119
so do you run any analytics on your

00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:59,549
attendees no I mean I typically I like

00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,649
to kind of in the run-up to it I like to

00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:03,059
look at the numbers I get quite excited

00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:06,659
if I see there's lots of people signing

00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,859
up I kind of ask people to sign in just

00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,289
so I know how many people are in the

00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:13,739
building in case we have to evacuate but

00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:15,209
I don't use it as a kind of a I don't

00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:17,129
ask me people to email addresses I don't

00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:20,099
try and market to them I don't try and

00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:21,450
hit them up for kind of information it's

00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:23,519
about just having that community of

00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,779
people can come and chat and you know

00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,599
like you said have a sort of social

00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:29,700
content I don't tend to personally I

00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,379
don't tend to do any analysis on who's

00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,320
coming or from which companies or you

00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:39,690
know that type of thing not really

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:41,369
anybody else I go through the list right

00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,169
as you're about to have the meetup the

00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:46,049
lists kind of populates and it shows how

00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:49,409
many times they've RSVP'd on the website

00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:51,119
when their first time they've they said

00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:52,320
they were coming and then you can kind

00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,409
of go through and kind of see what the

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,629
trends are but as far as I'm a huge

00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:59,339
proponent of if if someone from an

00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,899
organization inside the company were to

00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,339
say I want your meetup list because

00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,829
we're sponsoring this and I by the way

00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,659
we're gonna use this as a as a tool to

00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:08,629
try to sell to these people I would shut

00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:10,559
it down just like burn it to the ground

00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:12,059
because that's not what people are there

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,979
for right they're not there to be sold

00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,749
to you know your audience basically and

00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,309
then these people are passionate about

00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:19,379
the technology or want to or want to

00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:22,289
know more and so that's you know that's

00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:26,070
the intent so you got to keep that you

00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:27,629
know keep that like that and it'll just

00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,149
take a couple more questions to wrap up

00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:31,739
um but what's one thing that either

00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:32,099
someone told you what didn't wouldn't

00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:33,659
work

00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:35,099
or that you didn't realize would work

00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:39,109
that you accidentally ended up doing

00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,109
like what what surprised you that worked

00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:44,759
someone said to me that you should as

00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:48,239
Kim mentioned earlier that you should

00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:51,119
move location making a lease so that you

00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:52,139
know if you've got people I mean London

00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,849
probably doesn't have quite such as

00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:55,289
split as maybe Seattle but you know

00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:56,679
someone said you should go for different

00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:58,990
locations so that it

00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,029
look like you're always based in one

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,619
company's office or you know that you're

00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:06,009
heavily influenced by one company etc

00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:08,409
etc that was the worst advice I think

00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:10,090
ever because it felt like if we change

00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:12,070
location people then weren't quite sure

00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,600
where we were and they had to keep

00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,039
checking on the site and then people

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,379
would kind of go to the wrong place and

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,619
I was like that's actually crazy so we

00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:24,100
now consistently run it in the pivotal

00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:26,200
office and people know where it is and

00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:34,119
don't get lost and they show up and it's

00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:35,710
just much more straightforward anything

00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:37,840
else that surprised do you that was a

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:41,379
success that they didn't expect her that

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,230
someone told you wouldn't work for us we

00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:45,850
changed as we are mainly sirak focused

00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,580
that we have found meetups in Zurich and

00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:50,350
then once in a while we yeah we were

00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:57,399
told yet to something in Bern that's

00:31:50,350 --> 00:32:02,799
about one our train looks like but then

00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:05,559
there actually I didn't thought that it

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:09,100
will happen but we had 30 attendees out

00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:13,149
of out of nothing and it was really

00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:18,730
spontaneous defined there so it really

00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:23,139
surprised us it was successful dariya so

00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:25,119
now we assume now check where what the

00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:27,399
availability of the venue is and based

00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:31,360
on that we then or where the speakers

00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:34,119
are from or how it works for us but but

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,039
also then we do not change we have like

00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,139
our free locations and change maybe

00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:41,320
between these free locations but do not

00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:43,179
have always the different locations I do

00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,100
think it's worth pointing out that you

00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:46,840
can get all the advice you should get

00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,460
all the advice you can and we should

00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,499
find out what's been successful there's

00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,450
a lot of commonalities but every

00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:54,610
community is very different like you you

00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,350
can even look if you did have access to

00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:58,299
the meetup analytics you could see that

00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,759
the number of people that RSVP and

00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:03,159
attend the meetup like the percentage of

00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,200
RSVPs that attend varies greatly by

00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:06,970
country there's just different cultures

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,679
on whether or not you really come if you

00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:11,190
say you were coming

00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:14,230
I think the u.s. is one of the worst so

00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,210
so it that there are differences between

00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,490
locations in between communities so take

00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,049
take all the devices and look in one

00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:28,659
case it was bad advice in one case it

00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:31,629
was really good at vice have you ever

00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:35,169
considered asking for a fee so we split

00:33:31,629 --> 00:33:38,110
the costs pivotal in Seattle and Atlanta

00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:41,590
and Atlanta - we split the cost so they

00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:44,230
host it and then they provide beer we

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:47,649
provide the food but I'm also sourcing

00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:50,379
speakers and so as far as the fee goes

00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:51,759
we don't really charge our attendees we

00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:53,080
would rather pay that ourselves because

00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,179
we don't want it you don't have to pay

00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,730
to get us something however it would

00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:59,429
there's a psychological thing that's the

00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,659
study that if you pay a mom and olfi

00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:03,039
more people will show up so maybe we

00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:06,549
should do that in the United States

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:10,179
because it is flaky it's about half you

00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:12,879
know it's probably about half it's the

00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:15,879
UK as well I mean it's normally if I see

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,399
that say 50 people have signed up ice

00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:19,750
baby yet 25 to 30 depending on the

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,450
weather if it's a beautiful day in

00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:24,520
London nobody will show up I know that

00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:26,230
yes the stormy stormy came and spoke at

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,750
Arlo poke and I think it was like the

00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,389
first warm sunny day in London we'd had

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,399
it was like our first hint of summer no

00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,020
one came like it was just so beautiful a

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,419
day it was like I think we had maybe 10

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:40,510
people it was kind of quiet don't take

00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:43,540
it personally sorry I want to wrap up

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,829
with one final question I would ask you

00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,970
normally like would you do it again but

00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,919
I think it'd be more interesting to the

00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,389
audience like what's the one piece of

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,010
advice you'd give to them keeping in

00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:52,569
mind that a handful were meetup

00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,970
organizers and a lot of people are

00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:56,139
meetup attendees what's your one when it

00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,040
comes to meetups like what's the one

00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:58,240
thing they should do and they go to

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,579
meetups err why should they go to a

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,540
meetup for what should they bring to the

00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:03,910
table that would help the meetup

00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,490
organizer but one piece of advice to the

00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,809
audience um and it with any style that

00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:14,770
you would like that's kind of your

00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:16,750
closing well no pressure I mean for me

00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:19,839
personally the reason I do it is because

00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:21,670
I like being part of the community I

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,480
like meeting new people I like talking

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,490
to people

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,380
you know and I enjoy it it's really hard

00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,820
work I would say that if you're thinking

00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,640
of starting a meetup group don't

00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,770
underestimate how much effort it is it

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,540
will take up your time you will have

00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,130
some sleepless nights where a speaker

00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,300
will drop out at the last minute and you

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,770
suddenly have a gap and you've got a

00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,390
hundred people signed up and how do you

00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,970
get that new speaker to come in at the

00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:45,460
last minute like those things happen but

00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,990
you know I enjoy it but honestly I

00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,850
really enjoy it that's why I do it and I

00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:51,640
think if anyone's thinking of starting a

00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:53,050
meetup group think about it and then if

00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,850
you're passionate enough and it's

00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,619
something you really think you'll get

00:35:54,850 --> 00:36:01,540
some benefit out of I would recommend go

00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:04,090
ahead and do it yeah for me personally

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:07,420
it's really if you go to meetup do not

00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:09,850
really do not hesitate to share your

00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:12,310
thoughts I mean nothing is wrong just

00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:15,160
open up the discussion share your

00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:18,880
thoughts that that's really the real

00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,470
value that I see if you're an attendee

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,210
and you're getting to know the project

00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:25,210
or you're starting to play around with

00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,950
it offer to be a speaker because there

00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:29,200
are no dumb questions we're all in this

00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:31,119
learning together and if you want to

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,590
give the 101 level talk and maybe you

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,660

00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:37,390
but you've been really deep in it submit

00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:40,300

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,710
for all of us like after doing it for so

00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,450
