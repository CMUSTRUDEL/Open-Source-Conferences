Description: 
	Cloud Foundry in the Community - Kim Bannerman, IBM; Lukas Lehmann, Swisscom; Paula Kennedy, Pivotal; and Stormy Peters, Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry is more than an open source platform; it’s a growing community! In the past two years, our community has grown by leaps and bounds as a result of very passionate and dedicated people as well as crucial community tools like GitHub, Slack, and Twitter. Cloud Foundry meet-ups foster a collaborative, inclusive environment focused on new releases, best practices, and how customers are using Cloud Foundry.  Come meet Cloud Foundry organizer for Seattle and Atlanta Kim Bannerman of IBM, London organizer Paula Kennedy of Cloud Credo/Pivotal, and Lukas Lehmann of Swisscom (Swisscom helps to organize the CF Community across the EU). Moderated by Stormy Peters, VP of Advocacy for the Cloud Foundry Foundation. The panel will discuss lessons learned, what 2016 looks like for the Cloud Foundry community.
