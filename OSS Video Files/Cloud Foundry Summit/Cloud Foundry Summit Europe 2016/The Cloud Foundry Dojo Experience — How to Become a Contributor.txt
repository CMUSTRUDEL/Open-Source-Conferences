Title: The Cloud Foundry Dojo Experience — How to Become a Contributor
Publication date: 2016-09-30
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2016
Description: 
	The Cloud Foundry Dojo Experience — How to Become a Contributor - Cornelius Schumacher, SUSE Linux & Michael Trestman, Pivotal Cloud Foundry

The Dojo is Cloud Foundry's unique way of ramping up new contributors. Participants join existing core teams on site for six to ten weeks, and get introduced to technology, culture, and community by working as part of the team, pair programming all day. 

The Dojo experience immerses participants in the extreme programming culture practiced at Pivotal, as well as a wide range of tools and technologies. The Dojo embodies the values of transparency and openness, prevents siloing of project expertise within Pivotal, and ensures that Cloud Foundry development is accessible to the greater community. 

This presentation will give a first hand experience report about the Dojo from the perspectives of a new participant joining the BOSH core team and a full-time member of the project, and situate this in the broader context of Cloud Foundry software development.

okay so welcome we would talk about the

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,240
Cloud Foundry dojo so this is a unique

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,550
program which Cloud Foundry has to

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,380
introduce new contributors and we will

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,750
give you a first-hand experience how how

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,170
it is to to do the dojo so I did the

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,289
dojo my code this part of the Bosch team

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,590
and so my name is I'm here on the left

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,800
you see me I'm Connie yes ramappa I'm

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,750
working for Suzy Linux and yeah I did

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,059
the dojo in the Bosch team this summer

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,050
so all my memory is fresh and we try to

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:39,510
tell you all all I know about it hi I'm

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,649
Michael trestman and yeah I work for

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:49,140
pivotal in the San Francisco office

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:52,410
there so what is the dojo it's not a

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,420
karate class it is a program to get new

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,520
contributors started on Cloud Foundry

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,530
projects it is the fast track to

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,660
committer status for people who want to

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,879
do that so the goal is to immerse

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,769
participants in the practices of the

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,450
cloud foundry foundation and familiarize

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,960
them with the related technologies and

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,390
practices and it's about six to ten

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,990
weeks working in a team on-site and one

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,340
of the pivotal offices and in most ways

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,960
it's very similar experience to being a

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,270
new hire at pivotal the ramp-up is

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:27,000
pretty much the same in most ways yeah

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,460
and for me the journey got started so if

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,829
we go to the next slides it's it's

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,720
basically when we decided to become part

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,240
of God family so we started a project

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,880
that souza to work on the OpenStack CPI

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,380
and usually at those that we do a lot of

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,060
open source and what we usually would

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,740
have done is we would have just started

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,079
to write some code contribute create

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,280
some pull request and get involved but

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,570
then we learnt cloud phone which is a

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,880
little bit different there's this dojo

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,939
program which gets you started which is

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,619
this fast-track to commit our status so

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,180
we had to call with a crowdfunding

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,729
foundation they told us about the

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,340
program and so on and it all starts with

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,950
this remote pairing interview so we

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,439
heard about that in the keynote or in

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,479
the fireside chat this morning from Rob

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,760
miso so this is the same process what

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,480
what the pivotal employees go through

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,540
when they

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,610
tired so you'd get this test this remote

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,390
pairing thing just one hour remotely by

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,769
a Skype where an interviewer is doing

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,780
some remote pairing with you

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,370
to assess if you actually have the

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,530
skills the social and technical skills

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,989
to successfully come complete the dojo

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,629
and successfully work on the work on

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,890
Cloud Foundry so that's how they started

00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,590
so we got through that

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,349
I got approval there to start with that

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,769
and then started to organize the the

00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:46,709
dojo and as we wanted to contribute to

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:49,049
the Bosch CPI the OpenStack CPI the

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,239
natural place to do the dojo was the

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:53,760
Bosch team the Bosch core team so they

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,609
they were open to accepting me as a dojo

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,760
and so then I started to organize that

00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:01,260
and that's being in Germany is not

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,819
completely trivial because the Bosch

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,060
team is sitting in San Francisco and the

00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,319
pivot office there so we had to get this

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,290
disorganized took a little bit but

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,120
finally we I had everything in place

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,849
yeah and then the first day came I

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,760
arrived in San Francisco and the

00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:21,000
instructions I had where come to the

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,169
office at 8:45 join us for breakfast

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,569
there and make sure you are there at

00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:29,549
9:04 for the global stand up so that

00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,340
we're mostly all the instructions I got

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,680
so I went there I I attended the

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,720
breakfast and I attended the globe it's

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,910
staying there stand-up and then at

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,190
something like nine ten I was basically

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,669
part of the team and a ten at the first

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:49,019
daily daily stand-up where I met Michael

00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:51,389
and for us on the team it's just another

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,120
day a new teammate is always exciting

00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,560
but the fact that he's the dojo doesn't

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,540
really matter you know just welcome to

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,280
the team and let's get started doing

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,709
work and so yeah one of the kind of

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,720
unique things about pivotal and the and

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,549
cliff entry and and being in the dojo

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,560
for most people will be pairing we pair

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,750
all day and every day and this is what

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,069
it looks like so pair programming is

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,139
probably our most important core

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,940
practice essentially what it means is

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,739
that every bit of work you do you do

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,289
together with your pair two heads

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,180
instead of one and so usually the way it

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:25,220
works is that pairs will stick together

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,770
for one or two

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,990
sometimes a little bit longer and then

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,430
one person will keep the context with a

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,800
new pair while the other one rolls off

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,860
to another pair and another story so

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,540
what is pairing all about ideally what

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,490
it means is consensus on every decision

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,160
that you make in the entire engineering

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,260
process everything you do and so we

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,810
think that this yields two main benefits

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:52,010
the first is good decision-making two

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,450
has better than one and so hopefully

00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,300
this yields very high code quality

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,400
things like rigor and testing smart risk

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,070
management when you make decisions about

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,750
deployment and things like that and the

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,940
other key benefit is propagation of

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,500
knowledge throughout the team and

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,530
throughout the broader organization as

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,780
people move around as well but for it to

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,640
work for these benefits to happen both

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,600
people really have to understand what's

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:20,000
going on as you do things so this means

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,940
a lot of communication like a lot of

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,640
talking per unit of typing right and

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,320
yeah so it really puts a premium on

00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,990
communication skills and it does also

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,080
imply kind of what you might think of as

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,880
slowing down to speed up so in the short

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,560
term it can seem like you know all this

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,720
talking is taking a lot of time but we

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,160
think that very quickly it pays off and

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,750
is worth it and so this is a picture of

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,419
Cornelius and myself in the San

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,430
Francisco know this is Plato and

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,960
Socrates so I like to think that pairing

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,010
is in some ways a lot like the Socratic

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,180
method which is where you know by asking

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,950
questions in a kind of open-ended

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,419
dialogue two people can come to

00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,130
understand something that neither one

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,330
did at the start so you can actually

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,610
produce knowledge or understanding

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,400
through dialogue and asking questions

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,900
and I think pair programming harness is

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,729
something very similar to this for

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,680
engineering where you're not just trying

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:17,960
to produce knowledge but actual concrete

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,060
solutions and similar because two

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,669
engineers may have different strengths

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,740
different gaps in their understanding

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:26,000
and may come across a problem that

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,479
neither one of them really knows how to

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,610
solve but by pairing you can solve

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:35,280
problems that go beyond what either a

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:37,470
person has seen before and this really

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,380
is at a premium when working on problems

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,240
that are kind of unique or difficult or

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,220
baffling or novel something where there

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,510
isn't a well-known technique that you

00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,030
can just rely on to solve the problem

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,730
and on Bosch we see a fair amount of

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,310
problems like that day in and day out

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:55,440
and so really I think by asking

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,840
intelligent but maybe naive or

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,030
inexperienced questions and trying new

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,360
things an engineer that is out of his or

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:07,080
her depth can actually contribute a lot

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,810
by probing beneath assumptions or

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,760
looking at areas of uncertainty in novel

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,020
ways and that might yield a solution

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,910
that might those areas of uncertainty

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:19,530
might actually hide a novel solution

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:21,180
that nobody's seen before and so the

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,890
upshot of that the good news for dojo is

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,050
is that well you might feel overwhelmed

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,820
at first by the unfamiliar technology

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,550
and unfamiliar tools but you can

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,380
contribute just by asking questions just

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,729
by kind of being there and by pursuing

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,430
your own understanding you can actually

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:38,880
in many cases contribute to a concrete

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,620
solution of a problem yeah the pairing

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,660
certainly is the the biggest difference

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,750
for most of people I mean there are not

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,000
many places where pairing is done to

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,370
such an extreme degree as in

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,800
crowdfunding and especially a pivotal so

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,690
for me I never had worked like that so

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,789
it was really something I had to get

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,560
involved in but the great thing was that

00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,690
I actually was productive from day one

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,630
so at the first day we worked on a

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,640
hotfix for for some some part of Bosch

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,440
where where we just had to fix something

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,330
and I mean this is something where he

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,640
usually wouldn't let a newbie do that

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,810
but but as a pair I mean that was

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,210
something which worked out quite well

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,010
and for me it was a great learning

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,930
experience in this way because if you

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,789
are always together with somebody else

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,740
who knows different things I mean that's

00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,750
something which really really helps and

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,030
also gives if security about what what

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,190
you are doing so that that's really a

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,890
good part and one other really great

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,419
part about the pairing is that you talk

00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,419
to another person for for the whole day

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,979
so that's usually not what developers

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,200
are doing and many developers are

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,390
talking to their computer maybe if they

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,500
talked at all but in this case you

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,930
actually have to talk to the other

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,510
person so you you get to know every

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,310
member of the team in

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,250
first week basically because you're

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:54,470
switching pass every one or two days so

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,240
you really see a lot of different people

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,770
you see a lot of different expertise a

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,840
lot of different ways how to do things

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,970
and really get to get into that so the

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,830
pairing is I think a wonderful way to

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:10,310
get into a new project what also was

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:12,140
quite visible that there are certain

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,450
values and pivotal has pretty strong

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,340
values and that might not be as visible

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,540
if you're coming from the inside but if

00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,210
you're coming from the outside you see

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,580
that that these are actually there and I

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,500
say specifically imperative values

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,810
because they influence Cloud Foundry a

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,580
lot and the pairing is one one of them I

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,920
mean that's that's how most people in

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,840
California work but also the other ones

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,330
like the be humble that's something

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,370
which you need to be able to pair

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,200
program all day so give it a high as for

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,120
for that and that that makes a very

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,040
welcoming and open community where

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,170
people actually have the the social

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,170
skills and also are willing to interact

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,570
with people have the empathy to work in

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,070
a very good way with with others and

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,900
that's something which i think is also

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,930
reflecting the community which is great

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,040
and the last way you did the dinner at

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,580
home that's actually something which

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,170
surprised me because I was thought okay

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,370
they they have this schedule and they

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,470
work like that but I would have never

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,050
expected that actually five plus six

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,730
people are gone so it's really the the

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,020
office is empty within five minutes and

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,060
I was really surprised by that so

00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,670
because that really gives a way how to

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,880
sustain that every day and again and

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,880
again

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:37,770
that might be a contradiction but I will

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:44,060
leave that to explain to the extra

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:44,060
pivotal people now a question

00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:06,169
well so you everybody rotates and within

00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:07,669
a team everybody works on everything

00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:09,649
that's within the scope of the team so

00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:11,959
for one thing teams have to be carefully

00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:14,809
scoped but that itself is a kind of an

00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,309
important pivotal and foundation value

00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:18,589
is this idea of collective code

00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:20,749
ownership so if you are on a team you

00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:23,359
own everything that's in the scope of

00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:25,279
the team and so it's not like one person

00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:38,119
is an expert on one part of something

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:39,439
within a team everybody rotates if you

00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:42,979
if that happens then something has

00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:44,989
broken down and in my I mean sometimes

00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:46,489
code that you write changes because it

00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:48,259
doesn't work or somebody finds a better

00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:50,329
solution and that can be frustrating but

00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:53,389
it's not your code it's the team's code

00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:55,699
you're just part of the team so I think

00:11:53,389 --> 00:12:01,309
that attitude is kind of an important

00:11:55,699 --> 00:12:03,079
value that we have yep so yeah I was

00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:06,169
gonna talk a little bit about the rhythm

00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:09,169
of life at a pivotal and in the dojo

00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:11,749
process so the way we work is designed

00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:13,609
to optimize sustainable pace because we

00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:16,339
believe that happy healthy developers

00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,779
produce better software and also as a

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:20,779
developer it's nice to be a happy

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,759
healthy so our workday starts with

00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,459
breakfast and stand-up at just after

00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:27,519
nine o'clock we are encouraged to take

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,629
plenty of breaks whenever we need to

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,660
often this involves ping-pong but not

00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:35,269
always we have a one-hour lunch and no

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,279
working is allowed during lunch at the

00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:39,709
San Francisco office we often have

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,509
technical talks which are optional and

00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:45,289
usually include something to eat so

00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:47,449
that's kind of nice and as corny I said

00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:48,859
we stopped at 6:00 sharp and as well

00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:51,619
there's a general norm that you don't

00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:53,149
push code towards the end of the day you

00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,919
tend to not make the best decisions then

00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:58,129
so it's better to sort of wait until the

00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:59,749
morning and so we have a weekly cycle as

00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:01,039
well which basically starts with a

00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:03,049
planning meeting and ends with a

00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,850
retrospective which is where we kind of

00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,039
discuss how everything is going and the

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,520
team what's been working what's not what

00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,200
are the pain

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,420
points what are people hopeful about

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,150
fearful about that sort of thing so but

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,370
kind of a blend of technical discussions

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:19,520
and also kind of more personal or

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,620
personnel issues just a way to connect

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,120
with the team and sync up and so at the

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,770
end of the week you should feel you

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,300
should feel tired if you've been working

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,430
hard but you shouldn't feel exhausted it

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:33,650
should be sustainable and by Monday you

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:35,450
should be ready for another yeah this

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,950
rhythm was was really interesting for me

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,750
because that's not the way I usually

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,400
work because that also interrupts people

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,820
working at different times and so on so

00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,500
having this schedule getting up in the

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,500
morning having breakfast having daily

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,180
working for it I was going back home and

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,550
doing the same every day basically there

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,650
that gave me this kind of zen-like state

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,840
where we're just repeated and it was

00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,910
really I had the feeling that although

00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,450
it was intense and I learned a lot and

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,190
it was where also the tile tiring it was

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,850
something which actually is sustainable

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:10,850
so that was an interesting experience

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:13,010
definitely just exactly a time it's away

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,050
and then after the six-week where did

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,240
the dojo okay that's six weeks

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:20,540
interesting part of that alters the

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,460
environment so I think we have a photo

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,950
on the next slide yes so that's a pivot

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,680
office and this was designed for this

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,630
style of work it's it's an open plan so

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,460
it's basically a big open space where

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:35,180
everybody is sitting together

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,850
it's the workstations are set up for

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,650
pairing so you always have two people

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,960
working on to money to us two keyboards

00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,270
about one computer and sitting next to

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,280
each other and an interesting part is

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,380
that there they are no there's no desk

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,880
ownership in the sense so the team has a

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,310
certain area and the office and then the

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,500
team finds the place where the past work

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,530
after they have figured out who works

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,690
with whom and this is especially if you

00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,160
are doing the dojo and you are new in

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,720
the team that that's very nice because

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,210
you're basically on the same level as

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,400
everybody else you are part of the team

00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,770
you find the desk you lie like everybody

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,070
else and then then you can just start

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,270
start working so and then the office is

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,310
designed in a way that it's actually

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,110
quite pleasant to work there and by the

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,230
pairing I think it's also that's

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,149
something I also realized

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,850
there is some noise level there but if

00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:28,309
you talk to another person your brain is

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,040
trained to kind of remove their the

00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:33,800
background noise and focus on the on the

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,329
other partner one thing which you also

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,850
see a little bit small they're up there

00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:39,619
and there's a monitor which shows some

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,819
cio results and so that's that's

00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:42,679
something which also is kind of

00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:44,389
dominating the visual presence which is

00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,619
part of the extreme programming culture

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:47,990
there that everything is test driven

00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:50,420
everything is covered by CI and this CI

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,209
is omnipresent in the office so all all

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,920
wards are covered by or every team has a

00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:58,699
couple of monitors which which saw the

00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:01,610
show their current CI state and that's

00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:07,100
important part of the way how the teams

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:10,040
work talk a little bit about our CI so

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:13,550
this is an illustration of some of our

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,610
pipelines our Bosch pipelines and these

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,829
are series of tasks that test our code

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,949
in various ways and then promote the

00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:23,059
code for use in other pipelines so we

00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:25,220
use concourse that's what these

00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:27,740
visualizations are here that's our

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,629
wonderful open source CI system that was

00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,959
made in-house in the San Francisco

00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:35,240
office so CIS yeah as I said a very

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,179
important part of our culture we're

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,220
always watching the board it is the the

00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:42,019
command center and keeping keeping the

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,259
builds green-green is when they pass is

00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:46,759
everybody's responsibility when if if

00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,019
I'm bill that's read if that means if

00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,499
the last code that's been pushed to it

00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:53,839
is failing some tests then you you can't

00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:56,209
push to it so basically you're you're

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,040
held up until you fix it so the team

00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:59,779
must coordinate and figure out what has

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,959
to happen to get the build green again

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,699
do you revert forward tends to be kind

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,049
of a team decision or one pair is sort

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:07,459
of in charge of keeping the build green

00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:11,120
different teams work a little bit

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:16,250
differently but yes this is the the road

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,809
map of life as a developer and the so

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,760
the the structure of our pipelines

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:21,380
I think nicely reflects the structure of

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,289
the system of components that compose

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:28,580
bosh so the main components of Bosch are

00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:30,950
the director the agent which operates in

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,389
each stem cell on each deployed VM and

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,150
the client that you use to interact with

00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:35,730
it and then

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,500
several utility packages so basically

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:41,070
each component has its own pipeline that

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,720
runs it through a gauntlet of tests that

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,809
are in isolation or sort of quasi

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,160
isolation and then at the end of each

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:49,830
pipeline the build that's passed through

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,840
is promoted and then ultimately we have

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,150
a kind of master pipeline that we call

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,180
bats the Bosch acceptance tests and that

00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:59,280
runs all of these promoted builds

00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:03,570
together on against real infrastructure

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,960
before finally publishing the the the

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:12,600
final release on Bosch IO where it's

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,400
available to the community yeah for dojo

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,590
actually the having the CI is great

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,350
because you know when you do a mistake

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,820
there is some kind of safety net which

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,340
tells you that something goes wrong

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,440
before it goes out to a release or to a

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,360
production server or something so

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,150
concourse is a really important tool and

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,540
it's part of the the tooling there's

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,220
more tooling involved of course the

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,140
teams have settled more less on a

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,890
standard set of tools so it's all max

00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:43,800
it's all Ruby mine it's all shared as

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,090
vagrant involved there's the Linux

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,190
command line involved that there are

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,840
plenty of tours I think there's a little

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,150
bit of variety and people also try out

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,820
things they sometimes they try out

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:56,040
things for remote pairing and so on so

00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,770
it's a it's a variety of tools but kind

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,270
of a standard set of tools and you even

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,000
if you are not used to this you can

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,860
learn them very quickly while pairing

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,390
because you don't need to read a manual

00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,220
for looking up keyboard shortcuts but

00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,990
your partner will just tell you you're

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,559
slower type this and you would be faster

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,970
and that's great one one problem is the

00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,120
tooling actually is what what I also

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,980
realized is that most tools are not

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,920
prepared for pair programming there's

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,870
usually only one author and there's no

00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,520
way how to get two authors into

00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,770
something so get for example it doesn't

00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,929
allow for more than one author so there

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,970
are a couple of workarounds in place to

00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:35,880
be able to do that so forget for example

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,040
we use get to add which alternates

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,830
author and committer with every commit

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,990
source or both the members of the pair

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:46,480
get basically the same share of commits

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,430
so these are kind of workarounds if you

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,290
happen to work on tooling for developers

00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,600
please take this use case into mind and

00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:55,690
that the feature to have multiple

00:19:52,600 --> 00:20:00,630
authors for the same thing yeah that's

00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,630
that's a tooling um what's next oh

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,760
that's a good question

00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,840
so in principle there's no code review

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,390
aside from from pairing so we rely

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,060
obviously very heavily on a good test

00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,060
coverage and good decision making during

00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:23,170
pair programming that varies a little

00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:26,830
bit on Bosch for example our product

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:29,590
owner Dmitri is a very deeply technical

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,510
very knowledgeable developer in his own

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,460
right and he tends to get his hands

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,710
dirty a little bit with our code ideally

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:42,490
ideally there's no code review as a

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:43,330
separate as a separate phase so yeah so

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,600
next I'm going to talk a little bit

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,300
about learning kind of as as a core

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,560
value that's built into the way we work

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,270
it's built into our process in a few

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,390
different ways so I think first and most

00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,350
important is pairing itself you know

00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,690
working with people with different

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,970
backgrounds leads to a very potent

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,040
cross-pollination of ideas and

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,600
techniques like Cornelius said just kind

00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,450
of even something like keyboard

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,790
shortcuts but you know goes all the way

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,650
up to architectural patterns and just

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,360
ways of making decisions these things

00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,950
just spread in a kind of organic way

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,390
when you pair a program that doesn't

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,220
require a lot of extra overhead so

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:22,330
that's really great about it about a

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:24,460
pair programming but at pivotal and on

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,310
these Cloud Foundry projects we also as

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,780
I mentioned we make time for talks both

00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,490
kind of technical talks where we invite

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,380
outside speakers but it's also great

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,600
because if you work in this office you

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,210
have an opportunity to give talks very

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,640
frequently and so there's this kind of

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,040
like office wide tech talks but on Bosch

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,560
anyways we also have kind of a weekly

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:48,910
slot for lightning talks within the team

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,900
where somebody will discuss you know an

00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,490
issue they'll do a little bit of

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,780
research something that's been you know

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,400
bouncing around people have been asking

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,780
questions about someone will go the

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,809
extra mile and do some research and then

00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,360
present that to the team

00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:01,700
so that's always nice our pace as well

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,039
as designed to leave time and energy for

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,960
outside learning so ideally you can do

00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,340
some continued learning on your own as

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,190
well and finally I would say that

00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,749
hosting dojo participants is great as a

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,999
pivot as well because we get to work

00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:17,149
with people with different backgrounds

00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:20,330
from different countries often and yeah

00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:21,950
so that's that's always great yeah so

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,749
for me the learning was great of course

00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,700
through the pairing I learned a lot of

00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:26,990
other technology and so on but also by

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,519
being in the dojo but being in the

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,619
office I also learned a lot about the

00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,450
context in which this happens a lot of

00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:35,119
the people think how do they work

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,769
what what happens outside of the extra

00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,230
coat contribution so what you usually

00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:41,539
don't see if you are just communicating

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,039
where I get up so that was a great thing

00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:46,309
to learn and what also was quite

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,830
important for me and I am kind of a

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,869
relief to me when I realized okay I for

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,789
me it was clear I would have to learn a

00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,440
lot there but when I was there I

00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:56,629
realized that actually everybody was

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,879
learning a lot all the time so he always

00:22:56,629 --> 00:23:01,369
had to learn about a new story and how

00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:03,019
to how to tackle a new topic and and

00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:04,700
everyone the team was in this constant

00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:05,899
mode of learning and that's something

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,200
which i think is quite healthy because

00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:10,789
it really keeps you awake it keeps the

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,929
code fresh and it makes sure that the

00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:18,610
knowledge is transferred so after the

00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:21,649
dojo after the six weeks I went home and

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,240
I'm now working in the OpenStack CPI

00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:24,289
team I'm doing pairing all day and

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,940
that's actually something which

00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,070
surprised me a little bit how natural

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,019
this this became so when I got home

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,330
actually my daughter came to me with a

00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:34,249
computer problem and that was just

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,509
fixing it I realized okay my natural

00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:37,970
reaction was oh let's let's sit down

00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:39,350
together and fix that together that was

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,409
kind of interesting to see that it's

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,749
really it becomes a kind of a second

00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:49,600
nature and it's really a great way how

00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:52,549
to work together yeah and from that on

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,429
yeah I'm working as part of the the team

00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:57,590
now and that's kind of the natural

00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:00,169
progression then I'm half commit right

00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,889
now I'm a contributor I'm committee in

00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:03,169
Cloud Foundry

00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,120
and that was just done in six weeks so

00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:10,270
that's great

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:11,650
good some challenges doing the dojo I

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,390
think it's a great thing it's a really

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,250
great way to get started but it's also

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,770
there there are some things which are

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,500
challenging with that so the first of

00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:22,750
the things is that a crowdfunding really

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,640
is a unique project we talked about the

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,220
way how people work about the pairing

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,020
and so on that's that's pretty unusual

00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,360
and it's also a I mean it's an open

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,640
source project so everything is open but

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,510
you can't start just with contributing

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,760
by pull request and just you won't be

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,409
involved in the same way as in some

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,840
other projects where this is the primary

00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:45,730
way of contributing so this is kind of a

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,490
barrier and a challenge which I think

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,200
especially when cloud form is growing we

00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:54,250
have probably have to find ways out how

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:57,279
to make this less of a barrier the other

00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:59,500
thing is you have to be open to actually

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,270
like pair programming if you don't do

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,919
that if you don't want to do that to you

00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:07,080
you won't have fun and you won't succeed

00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,080
so that that's a big part yep

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,130
that's a good question I personally

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,370
don't have numbers about that

00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:31,470
the people I worked with and I have met

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:33,059
by that I mean most are actually

00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,429
prepared for that they want to do that

00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:37,200
and they were really very happily

00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:38,250
getting involved in that that's why

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,440
you're working but I don't have any

00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,820
statistics about that so but that's

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,470
that's actually a good and interesting

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:48,360
question and that's part of I think my

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,760
third point there some of the thing is

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,190
not very transparent so this kind of

00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,110
data is not publicly available how you

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,029
get in the dojo is documented and so on

00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,039
but there are some processes where it's

00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:00,840
not always clear is there pivotal is

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,870
that the crowdfunding foundation is that

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,130
the community and a lot of things are

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,600
just happening by talking to other

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,149
people and then then things become very

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,669
clear and and you understand them but

00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:13,110
you need to do this conversation thing

00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:14,850
and that's I think also part of the

00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,070
culture it's great if it happens but if

00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,690
you come from the complete outside it

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:22,020
would be very difficult I think to get

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,760
started and that extends a little bit to

00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,529
the technology as well there is a lot of

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,549
tested knowledge which you realize when

00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:28,110
you are there you learn everything

00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:31,710
that's great where the dojo is a great

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:34,049
way to get people into the community but

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,640
maybe sometimes we could document things

00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:39,120
a little bit better for people who just

00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,279
look from from the outside and last but

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,679
not least it is an investment to send

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,020
somebody to the dojo spending six weeks

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,980
in San Francisco's expensive also

00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,840
committing to basically a year of

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,570
full-time participation after the dojo

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,100
which is part of the agreement that

00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,080
that's something I mean that's a serious

00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,080
investment you have to really seriously

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,279
want to contribute but then I think it's

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,049
absolutely worth it

00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:09,840
and to conclude that some tips how to do

00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:11,340
the dojo you have to talk to people

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,980
who've done it I think that that's very

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,929
important so you get the impression what

00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,429
it is you learn about how it works what

00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:19,169
you have to do and so on so that's

00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:21,510
that's quite important and you have to

00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:24,450
be really very open you have to be open

00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:27,090
that to do a lot of things which are

00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,580
from what we are used to so you have to

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:32,040
be open you have to get engaged you have

00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,620
to ask you have to speak up you have to

00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,330
tell people what's what you need you

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,630
have to ask questions you have to ask

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,250
all these seemingly stupid questions

00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,400
which actually are the right questions

00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,020
to get some thinking going and so on so

00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,840
that this is absolutely essential I

00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,270
think you have to be humble that's part

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,860
of working with the pair every day that

00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,720
doesn't work if you are not humble and

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,880
you're insisting on your opinion but you

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,520
also have to be fearless because you in

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,410
many cases work on something where you

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,750
don't have any idea at the beginning how

00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,550
to deal with that but that's again

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,950
something where the pairing helps a lot

00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,960
because you have the means to find out

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,400
what what it takes so it's an

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,240
interesting combination with what you

00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,880
need I mean you really need to be active

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,200
but also humble in the same way and your

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,820
life as developer will be different

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,240
after the dojo that's that's for sure as

00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,400
well and I can only recommend to brush

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,980
up your ping pong that's the main

00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,840
activity to have a small break between

00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,210
coding and that's a great thing and you

00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,060
would have fun with that so for me the

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,940
generator by advises yeah and enjoy the

00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,800
time enjoy doing the dojo and I think

00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,600
it's really really very beneficial to

00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:48,180
the project and a great way to introduce

00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,880
people yeah talk to us if you want to

00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,430
know more we are here for the conference

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,820
you see our email addresses writers

00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:59,490
write us we also on slack that's the

00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:02,190
usual platform there's a channel dojo a

00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,740
loonie where we try to collect some of

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:08,070
the people who have done the dojos so we

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,600
can actually share knowledge and I think

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,150
that's the end

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,990
[Music]

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:21,360
[Applause]

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:27,090
so do we have time for some questions

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:50,070
others did some questions they want

00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:52,260
pressing questions okay yeah that is the

00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,730
thing not just for de jurors but in the

00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,470
pivotal office we have like regular

00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,540
teammates on Bosch some of them don't

00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:59,820
work for pivotal so there are occasional

00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:09,060
meetings I'd say maybe once every month

00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:10,920
or two where excuse us but so it's it's

00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:15,630
relatively rare but it does it does

00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,640
happen yeah from my experience it was in

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,230
the pivot office they are pretty open

00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,420
anyway there there are people from other

00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:23,070
companies as well so and sometimes you

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,040
you get told okay this is an internal

00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:27,900
meeting so so you can't participate all

00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,820
the stuff we are working on is open the

00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,280
tracking is open the planning's open the

00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,980
the code is open source so there's

00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,090
nothing to hide there no secrets and I

00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,770
think there is a little bit of a

00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,600
separation between teams are working in

00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:42,750
open source and were working on

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,930
proprietary parts but in general this is

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,700
of course there is some trust part of

00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,860
that so so you might see some things

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,810
there which are not meant for you but I

00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:56,240
think that's that's part of trust for

00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:58,830
collaboration in most situations anyway

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,560
okay our time is up thank you for

00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:04,060
attending

00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,060
