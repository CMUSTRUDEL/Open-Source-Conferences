Description: 
	The Cloud Foundry Dojo Experience — How to Become a Contributor - Cornelius Schumacher, SUSE Linux & Michael Trestman, Pivotal Cloud Foundry

The Dojo is Cloud Foundry's unique way of ramping up new contributors. Participants join existing core teams on site for six to ten weeks, and get introduced to technology, culture, and community by working as part of the team, pair programming all day. 

The Dojo experience immerses participants in the extreme programming culture practiced at Pivotal, as well as a wide range of tools and technologies. The Dojo embodies the values of transparency and openness, prevents siloing of project expertise within Pivotal, and ensures that Cloud Foundry development is accessible to the greater community. 

This presentation will give a first hand experience report about the Dojo from the perspectives of a new participant joining the BOSH core team and a full-time member of the project, and situate this in the broader context of Cloud Foundry software development.
