	CF Server-Less: CloudFoundry as a Platform for Server-less Computing - Nima Kaviani & Michael Maximilien, IBM

As CloudFoundry matures to become the de-facto platform for enterprise cloud computing, it is no surprise that various types of computing services need to be supported. Server-less computing is a new name for various previous concepts or technologies, e.g. functors, functional programming. In this model of computing, applications are written as a series of small functions with clear input and output and can be executed in the cloud on demand. The difference between this approach and eg. micro-services is that the backend part only executes when invoked. In this talk we compare and contrast possible approaches to make CF a first class platform for server-less computing. We explore retrofitting the current CF app push model, leverage open source server less platforms like OpenWhisk, and investigate how the CF runtime (Diego) could be improved to support server less apps as on-off tasks.
