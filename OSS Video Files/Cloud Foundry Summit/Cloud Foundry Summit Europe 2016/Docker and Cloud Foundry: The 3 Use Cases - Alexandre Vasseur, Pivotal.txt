	Docker and Cloud Foundry: The 3 Use Cases - Alexandre Vasseur, Pivotal

With Diego, Cloud Foundry is capable of deploying and running apps as Docker images. That is now easy to orchestrate, scale and manage in production those Docker containers up to the point that what you care is not Docker but the app itself. But there is more you can do to and explore combining Cloud Foundry with Docker! 

- leveraging Docker service broker, possibly using Docker Swarm managed by BOSH to provide containers as a service with all the BOSH and service broker great capabilities 
- leveraging Concourse and Docker based pipeline to ensure your run pipeline in isolation, using Concourse as BOSH release with garden-runC.

Those 3 uses cases are fully independent yet all use Cloud Foundry, BOSH and Docker to align to specific requirements. Come learn about those combined architectures, seem them in action thru live demos, and expand the possibilities with Cloud Foundry.
