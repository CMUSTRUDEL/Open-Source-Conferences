	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,480
so when I was doing the research for

00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:05,100
this talk I found out a lot about

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,589
insurance which I didn't know

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,940
for example aliens has more than I think

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:14,099
85 million customers a hundred and forty

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,210
thousand employees so it's a very large

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,859
positive sum game to use Sam's analogy

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,859
aliens also ensures something like

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,470
three-quarters of the global 500 top 500

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,830
come fortune 500 companies for

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,940
everything from building insurance to

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:35,579
cyber attacks to drones now and it has

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:41,219
also insured all 24 of the James Bond

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:43,140
films in production we already had very

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,910
good introduction to rob me but just to

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,600
say a little bit about pivotal it's now

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,969
valued at 2.8 billion after a recent

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,449
investment by Ford and Rob was full

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,230
shows one of the 35 coolest CEOs in

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,050
Silicon Valley

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,670
by Business Insider last year he also

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:08,189
was on their list of Silicon Valley

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:10,549
stars over 50 because he founded pivotal

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,159
labs 27 years ago and was one of the

00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:16,020
pioneers of agile development so Andres

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,119
let me start with you so Price

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,820
Waterhouse Cooper brought I was a report

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,890
last year where they said that insurance

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,400
is the industry facing the most

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,409
disruption right now so what are the

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,799
biggest challenges that aliens is facing

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,630
because of those changes one of the

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,700
biggest challenges at the moment is

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,939
obviously our low interest rate

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,130
environment I mean you can imagine being

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,710
a life insurance company or even a PNC

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,930
Insurance Company and that's a very big

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,320
challenge but that's maybe not so

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,119
interesting for this venue here

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,780
digitalization is the topic that is most

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,119
interesting for us so we see some

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,939
changing customer behavior obviously a

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,729
lot of people get their quotes and they

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,149
buy online but in the German market we

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:09,490
don't see it so much it's about 10%

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:12,130
slowly rising but not tremendously

00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,950
main change in the customer behaving the

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,770
behavior is research online purchase of

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,810
line so they get quotes they get

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,970
information online but they still

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:25,150
purchase offline without eight agents

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:28,330
with the bank's with our brokers and and

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,910
other sales chambers and we have to

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,090
support this changing customer behavior

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:37,300
and then obviously we see a lot of new

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:40,270
competitors are disrupting the industry

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:43,120
and increasingly also attacking

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:46,480
insurance companies so you see connect

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,800
and Clark and all the apps that try to

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,020
enter the customer interface and

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,630
offering some convenient service for the

00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,470
end customer for managing their

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:02,470
insurance or some lien contract

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,960
administration or some life planning or

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,510
investment planning so it sounds like

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,190
you need to become more customer centric

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,110
and you need to provide more continuous

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,020
services maybe to your customers

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,170
everything faster more convenient

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,160
definitely

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:20,500
so I mean digitalization itself is not

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,460
at the center of it it's still the

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,140
customer so for example we don't offer

00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:30,400
some special tariffs in the health

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:33,820
insurance industry where we grant some

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,770
rebate when you wear variables so that's

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,770
not the main topic because it's not

00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,470
value-adding for your customer but we

00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,020
offer apps to make a claim filing

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,270
process automated that's a real

00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,430
convenient factor for our customers and

00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,520
that is very important for us well we

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,100
launched in Germany dision April our

00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,860
telematics terrific bonus drive where

00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,670
you get for some good driving behavior

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:04,230
where you get to repay it for up to 40%

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:07,420
and this is something where we sold now

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,660
since April some 9000 policies and we

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,840
aim for some 25 at the moment market

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,880
leader in in Germany so Aliens adds its

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,830
own telematics chip to the car and

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,590
monitors the driver is that how it works

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,169
there are two different solutions one is

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,419
used

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:26,270
box inside the car and one is an app and

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:30,289
this bonus Drive that works through the

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:33,139
app so it measures how you speed or

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:35,930
break your car and it's measured with

00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,520
the app so is this change to a more

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,199
customer centric approach one of the

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,870
reasons you started looking at cloud

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,199
foundry and talking to pivot oh

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,560
definitely

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:48,889
so this is one reason why we have to

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:52,099
really invest and speed up our internal

00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:55,279
development and therefore I was looking

00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:56,960
initially was driven by Artie I was I

00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,979
was looking and doing some market

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,620
research looking at some cloud concept

00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:06,409
for large enterprises which offering

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,240
hybrid solutions I always have to go for

00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:10,279
a non-prime solution because of

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,520
sensitive data in Germany that's a very

00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:17,659
big topic and then after checking some

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,969
some of my connections the

00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:25,240
recommendation pivotal Cloud Foundry is

00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:28,310
one of the most major platforms and then

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,560
regular I go to the consumer electronics

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,469
in Las Vegas and visiting some companies

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,960
in that area in in January and in

00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:39,529
January this year we visited also and

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,009
pivotal in San Francisco and some other

00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:46,219
companies there of course and the good

00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:51,529
thing about it then it was this time not

00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:53,810
an only an IT driven an activity our CEO

00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:57,490
of aliens Germany and head of market

00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:00,349
management he joined us so he could see

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,629
immediately what the benefits also for

00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:08,330
the business is there and that was some

00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:12,770
very crucial moment there and myself and

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:15,729
the CEO they were both pretty convinced

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:19,610
that this could influence our speed at

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:23,449
digitalization and therefore we went on

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:26,210
a journey with pivotal I can't explain

00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:28,129
so you're not just transforming your IT

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,159
organization it's the entire company is

00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:32,139
turning into an agile business

00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:35,169
definitely but that's one of the main

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:37,569
drivers so we had some activities some

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:39,489
maybe five or six years ago where we

00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:42,279
tried to transform the software

00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:45,519
development process in an agile fashion

00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:49,739
but we failed miserably because it was

00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:53,529
purely IT driven and if you don't do

00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:55,689
colocation if you don't get the buy-in

00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:58,269
from the business owner then you

00:06:55,689 --> 00:07:00,369
definitely will fail and this is no

00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:02,259
different so Rob have you seen similar

00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:04,330
things at other companies that if it's

00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:08,319
if the impetus is only coming from IT

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:10,990
it doesn't always work yeah for sure and

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,499
I think you know as Andreas was saying

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,779
with the colocation so for a long time

00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:19,089
we learned long ago as we worked with

00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:20,679
with companies large and small being

00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,899
change agents it really helped to get

00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:24,669
them out of their everyday environment

00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,050
and into a new immersive experience

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:27,639
where they could work with modern

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,759
techniques modern technologies without

00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:33,519
the distractions of their sort of legacy

00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,879
environment if you will and as we work

00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,349
with companies like Allianz were also

00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,909
not just being changing its but we're

00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:42,069
helping them create change agents

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:44,050
internally and those change agents will

00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:46,929
face the same challenges

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,459
so there are increasingly making their

00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:54,189
own spaces both organizationally and

00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,809
structurally physical plant spaces new

00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:57,789
new organs anaise organizational

00:07:55,809 --> 00:08:00,279
structures in order to carry out that

00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:03,069
change at the same pace so I know

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,929
initially that pebble used to send yeast

00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,759
offender developers into the clients

00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:08,379
office and trying to work there but then

00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,059
after certainly much time for example

00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:12,129
after working with Google you decided

00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:13,869
they needed that separate space yeah and

00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:15,779
actually andreas I think you're doing

00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:18,479
the same right you set up your own

00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:22,779
garages as you call them already exactly

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:25,209
so that was basically we did the copy of

00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:28,419
the pivotal lab somehow and the copy of

00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:31,119
the concept I was pretty convinced that

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:33,699
setting up these new garages within the

00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:36,430
premises that would fail because

00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:38,319
typically in our cases so we love being

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:41,110
a traditional organization we love

00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:42,200
waterfall and we love our land line

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,840
organization

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,930
and we love several layers of our

00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,190
steering committees I mean everybody of

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:53,630
you who is working in a large

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:56,900
organization knows that too and so I

00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:00,590
said it has to be a little bit away from

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,690
the headquarter but not too far away

00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:08,450
that I could send people to that

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:11,060
location and but far enough so that the

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:19,940
line manager cannot influence the daily

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:22,250
work of the team member that's clearly a

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:28,310
popular notion with the audience seems

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:32,450
to be yes and typically our developers

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:35,840
or a business analyst or designer they

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:38,060
work on five projects at the same time

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,530
and if you are good you are working on

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:45,530
10 and that's tremendously inefficient

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:48,410
so the first task was to get them out of

00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:51,170
their traditional environment and put

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:55,970
them into the garage concentrating on

00:09:51,170 --> 00:10:00,560
one project and that's mandatory that

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:03,460
the team members work co-located so all

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,320
disciplines from market management

00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:10,430
analyst design and development school

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,550
located and in these garages at least

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:16,970
from Monday to Thursday and maybe Friday

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:19,340
they can do some some line management

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,680
some maintenance stuff but they have to

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,320
work together in an agile fashion so

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,900
that these are teams from 10 to 12

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,870
people one product owner two to three

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:33,260
designers five to six developers and

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,210
then they work in the agile fashion and

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,520
there's a standard meeting office

00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:40,550
stand-up meeting every morning so we

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:45,350
don't do it like in the London lab in

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:51,260
nine at 9:06 we do it at 912 it's 50

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:53,020
minutes and then that's because of the

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,850
schedule of

00:10:53,020 --> 00:11:01,550
underground so it comes a little bit

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:03,890
later there and then there will be the

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:06,980
team stand up and then they will go into

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:10,340
the pairing session and this is a very

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:13,250
important concept there which we also

00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:17,180
copied and from the pivotal labs so we

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:22,580
pair the designers every day just to get

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:24,980
a better code quality and to do some

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,650
know-how sharing with the junior and

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,170
more senior developers and I think you

00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,620
made also we discussed it yesterday over

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,510
dinner

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,640
so you made also some very good

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,140
experience with this pair programming in

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,720
combination with the test-driven

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:41,860
development I think it's interesting

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,230
that you are essentially

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,760
disintermediating your your management

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,850
and your developers really devolving a

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,590
lot of power down into the teams so all

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,910
of the process and not being not being

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,380
directed by the manager they can make

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:58,630
their own decisions more and more you

00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:00,980
were saying but also with respect to IT

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,330
because they can self-service on

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,210
everything now right so there definitely

00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:08,330
definitely so historically so our

00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:11,060
experience so to get a deployment that

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:13,310
would take maybe two or three days to

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,770
production with a lot of manual tests

00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:18,380
and so on and so on and now with the

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:21,050
with the apps in the garages we can do

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,170
it on the basis of Cloud Foundry we can

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,870
do it within minutes obviously you have

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:29,060
to keep up the discipline to get the

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:32,330
test coverage of the test cases in the

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:35,240
test driven development quite high over

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:37,820
90 95 percent your ideal case would be

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:42,280
97 percent as I learned yesterday we are

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:46,460
not there yet but we are constantly

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:50,030
increasing but this is the the concept

00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:53,270
and I got since it was driven the whole

00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:56,990
initiative from our CEO I got a lot of

00:12:53,270 --> 00:13:00,260
buy-in from all parts of the upper

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,410
management they really see that software

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:06,759
development is faster

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:10,180
the result is better we do a lot of test

00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,019
customer testing in the iterations in

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,060
the sprints

00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:18,610
we bought some design company from from

00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,220
teak the local branch in Munich we

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:24,100
integrated them into our garage concept

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,339
and then we got some design capability

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,980
which we set in in the teams and at the

00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:35,589
moment we are running at a pretty high

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:39,040
speed so the visit to the pivot laps was

00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:41,920
in January so 8th of January we opened

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:47,009
the Munich lab in April and the lab in

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:49,540
Stuttgart in July and in Munich now

00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:53,920
nearly hundred people working in that

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,810
fashion and in Stuttgart it's 86 I'm

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,370
like four people going to pivotal labs

00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,860
in London the end of last year I think

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,829
to almost 200 already working in this

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,269
way how did you navigate the change of

00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:07,089
people's rules

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:08,920
so generally pivotal only has about

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:10,930
three different rules designer product

00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,550
manager and developer and I'm sure there

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,949
were many more in audience including the

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,029
line managers exist so like how you

00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:18,220
talked about how you add these boot

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,790
camps can you tell us a little bit about

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,319
at the beginning of each of these

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,610
projects that there's a boot camp and

00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:30,130
the designated team members meet and

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:33,850
they get all about the technology the

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:37,089
build pipeline the HR process and so on

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:42,550
and so on and then there are different

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:44,829
roles in the teams discussed and we do a

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,649
complete change we also have only these

00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:50,380
three roles and it's not important from

00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,809
which line function they come from only

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,899
the skill is important and that's quite

00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:59,259
a peculiar thing sometimes you find out

00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:00,879
because you see then the history of the

00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,670
people that you find very good

00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,129
developers in market management you will

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,139
find very good developers who are at the

00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:10,600
moment business analysts and you could

00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:12,309
use obviously this skill in the team and

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,080
then they go to different roles

00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:16,780
irrespective from from the

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,910
Sooey and how do you get so you said you

00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,860
had buy-in at the sea level let's say

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,390
but what about the people more in the

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,040
middle management who were probably

00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,530
traditionally the line managers at these

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,110
developers and so on like how'd you get

00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,580
them to trust these new teams and like

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,520
build that trust that they could devolve

00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:36,520
more authority to them and so on that's

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,680
at the moment still in progress I would

00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,050
say is that one most difficult that's

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,570
one of the most difficult yeah I mean

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:47,020
that's one of the most difficult things

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:51,640
because their role is changing I mean

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:55,750
just imagine some kind of we call it

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:59,530
III head of a group of say 10 to 15

00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:02,170
people if this guy would send 10 of his

00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:04,090
best people to the garage left with five

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,580
doing the maintenance of the old

00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:09,610
applications that's not the fun part of

00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,520
the work and therefore we have to change

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:16,300
the roles of these guys a little bit

00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:18,840
more distinctive say one is people

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,340
leader and one is the role in the garage

00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,050
so well how do you incentivize them

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:27,180
because you're saying basically they're

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:30,640
losing their best people more or less

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:33,250
that's a staffing problem process I

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:36,190
think we have a very good overview of

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:39,130
the skills and the profiles of our guys

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,590
and then the the screening we would

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:45,480
would be interested in the garage and we

00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:48,190
also have obviously a big pull from the

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,190
employees from our colleagues to go into

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:55,990
roles in the garage and therefore at the

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:57,430
moment I don't have to push anybody so

00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,500
do you think I know you have mainly

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,570
taken people who are already working

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,770
with aliens into the garages but do you

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,940
think you're gonna change the way you

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:10,030
hire new people as well that's one thing

00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:12,940
so thank God I got some new positions

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:17,199
for RIT that was granted in the board a

00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:19,660
couple of weeks ago but I think we have

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,750
to change our hiring process and there I

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,260
learned yesterday that there is a very

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,079
distinctive hiring process at

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:31,560
little doing pair programming interviews

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,560
it's called Rob's pairing interview rpi

00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:37,320
and then you do some pair programming

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,230
with Rob and you did I think over 2,000

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:46,920
interviews so obviously quite

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:48,120
successfully Oh should I so this was

00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,430
something that evolved over many years

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,470
at pivotal and it was designed to

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:58,830
relatively quickly in under an hour

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,140
assess whether someone would be you know

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,900
a good fit for the style of work that we

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:07,650
did and would be capable of keeping pace

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:10,350
with the teams and in addition to

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,910
fundamental programming skills you may

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,600
have you have to be a programmer really

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:17,250
to to understand let alone pass the test

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,190
but that's sort of not the most

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,590
important part the important part is

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,110
that you can think abstractly that you

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,960
can think and interact very quickly and

00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,160
that you have a great deal of empathy so

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,780
we obviously work in a highly

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,120
collaborative environment we pair and so

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,560
forth so those are the things we really

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,110
look for empathy actually being the

00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,450
thing that has emphasized the most as

00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:42,410
many people in this audience know that's

00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:47,180
that's also something that we do for

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:50,100
people who wish to become committers and

00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,230
to Cloud Foundry okay work full-time on

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,470
it so they also go through that gating

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,500
exercise so even other you know members

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:02,430
of the foundation

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,650
you know I IBM sa PHP are training

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,000
people on how to administer that that

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,920
programming interview so again with the

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,940
focus on AB student skill rather than

00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:14,520
background in history that's one that's

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,250
one additional concept was which is very

00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,120
interesting according to my opinion for

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,950
large enterprises which we learned then

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,860
through our cooperation with pivotal and

00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,540
this is the concept of lean startup so

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,170
typically you will find as an

00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:33,870
organization waterfall and very very

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,640
large projects so the information is

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,440
gathered and gathering demands

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,440
requirements for over a year

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,379
then giving these kind of concepts to

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,149
the IT we come back with estimates of a

00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:48,570
couple of million nobody could afford

00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:50,820
and then we go fighting about each

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:54,210
requirement and then be come up with

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:58,529
some compromise and nobody is happy we

00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:01,200
try to change this somehow and this is a

00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:04,470
concept that was transferred from

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,960
startups into into enterprises and it's

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:10,950
called lean startup so we always think

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,320
in MVPs of a hundred days now and it's

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:16,980
quite difficult obviously to implement

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:21,929
that change but if it is successful it's

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:23,820
very very powerful this concept so think

00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,309
of a venture capitalist who would like

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,919
to invest we have a team basic size

00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:31,559
twelve people and that goes for a

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,720
hundred days so you have to invest

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,509
something between five hundred six

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,789
hundred thousand euros and this team

00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:42,360
commits on a certain scope and you

00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:44,879
initially say you have to reach order to

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,769
me that the team commits to certain KPIs

00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:51,149
and we commit that we get the following

00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:53,580
feedback from our customers the

00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:56,490
following sales figures whatever and

00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,649
then this venture capitalist internal

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:02,309
venture capitalist committee says okay

00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:04,649
go for it we can try and this MV PSR was

00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:10,039
in such a fashion that you can stop

00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:12,960
afterwards so because we're out of time

00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:14,879
but if anybody would like to come up and

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,379
talk to Andreas or Rob after the talk

00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,909
you can ask him any questions that you

00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:19,289
want because we could be talking about

00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,659
this on stage for another 20 minutes

00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:23,309
quite easily but we need to leave the

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:25,530
next speakers on so thank you very much

00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:30,289
gentlemen

00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:30,289
