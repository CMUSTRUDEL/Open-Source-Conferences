[Music]

00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:11,190
yeah first off I just want to say thanks

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,420
for coming out on a Sunday when we

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,340
wanted to schedule this before spring

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,509
one we had to make the decision to take

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,840
a little bit of weekend time and I

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,830
wasn't sure and this this is amazing so

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,410
great to have you here

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,670
can you guys throw my slides so I just

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,250
wanted to do a quick welcome for

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,189
everybody and answer a quick question

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,109
why cloud foundry why right now there's

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,130
all this buzz happening and it's it's

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,840
interesting people come up to me like

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,210
why is there all this buzz what what

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,950
changed I thought I thought we had cloud

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,559
already why is this platform thing

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,790
happening and why suddenly is it

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,489
happening so fast

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,620
so this is a familiar theme but it's

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,640
becoming more and more real every day is

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,570
that there's a lot of very wealthy

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,520
enterprises that have controlled the

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,129
economic system in the world for a long

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,980
time and that economic system is being

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,039
challenged and changed by software at a

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,229
faster and faster pace every day but a

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,360
lot of those organizations built

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,360
software development processes that look

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,270
like this and they built these back when

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,090
is this work at Sun Microsystems in 2004

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,530
very large 24-month software deployments

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,080
and they developed a whole bureaucracy

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,090
around how you go about managing systems

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,580
and software and delivering value that

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,590
is now incredibly out-of-date and so

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,630
when a developer wants to go create a

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,460
new application or apply business logic

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,259
to an application that already exists

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,170
they have to you know get through this

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,900
maze and there's a whole economy

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,570
happening right now of startups and

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,880
incubators and small companies that are

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,280
taking agile teams of very highly

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,530
proficient developers and challenging

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,180
existing economic systems with them Paul

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,649
Graham is most famous for this he

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,409
measures software delivery and user

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,420
acquisition every week and he has he has

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,579
a startup cycle and measure every single

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,799
week and everyone in this room that

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,200
works at a large enterprise he's out to

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,210
get you and they're coming for you and

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,399
so you either find a platform deliver

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,970
value faster or you buy one of his

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,890
companies that's the decision

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,230
so was this built for an agile team the

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,700
answer is no was a virtual machine built

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,900
for an agile team now this is really

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,360
where this conversation gets very

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,670
interesting this is a VM on demand the

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,440
way to empower your agile teams the

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,400
thesis of platform as-a-service is

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,050
absolutely not

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,150
it's not the right way of empowering

00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,230
agile team because you have to have

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,850
someone on that small team that

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,380
understands operating systems and

00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,630
operating system security and patch

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,890
levels and wiring load balancers all

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:38,480
these other things that have nothing to

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:40,370
do with writing code the special thing

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,310
about paths is is the application

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,380
centric layer and cloud it's all about

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,630
providing an optimal developer interface

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,850
for an agile team to move quickly and

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:53,180
create value Cloud Foundry was built

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,830
soup-to-nuts to address that problem to

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,630
allow an enterprise to have an agile

00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,110
team to quickly iterate with software

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,310
with semantics and language that is very

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,710
specific to what a developer would

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,560
already understand take my application

00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,300
file run it for me in production take my

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,370
application file scale it out to a

00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,350
thousand instances in a minute take my

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,090
application file and auto wire a new

00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,530
service into it these are things

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,450
developer already needs and so when you

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,100
build a small team you don't have to

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,450
have a specialist anyone get him an area

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,300
they're all able to use the platform

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,800
very naturally but a lot of platform

00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,360
service plays out there those people are

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,890
trying to make developers lives easier

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,330
why is Cloud Foundry suddenly fill a

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,470
room on a Sunday like that's an

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,030
interesting question I was thinking

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,920
about all weekend why is that happening

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,140
what's special about this the other

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,820
angle here is that scalable software is

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,769
eating the world so there's something

00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,540
unique happening where before you

00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,769
thought of a system on one server and

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,650
now you're thinking on thousands of

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:48,530
servers and suddenly there's one person

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,709
from Baidu here I just met him here he

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,440
is raise your hand yeah so we're not

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,880
making this up as some of our

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,519
Confederate grumpy about this because

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,100
it's amazing use case they're able to do

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,230
a billion pages a day right now with

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,120
cloud foundry at high scale there's no

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,769
other open source platform service or

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,860
any platform server that's able to do

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,360
that there's a whole trend happening

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,580
where there's a new open source

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,260
interface to thousands of servers that's

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,180
the new emerging architecture that's got

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,770
everyone very excited but dupes another

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,390
great example of this how do you run a

00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,109
MapReduce job across a thousand servers

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,000
that wants with

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:24,969
blocking how do you deploy a thousand

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,139
apps at once with across different

00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:29,990
environments with no blocking that's

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,310
what Cloud Foundry does so a couple of

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,110
quick show-off stats that help drive

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,449
this home that really get people excited

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,250
about our platform in a virtual machine

00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,169
world in Amazon it might take five or

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,639
six minutes to create a VM and know that

00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,229
you have it in Cloud Foundry you can

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,629
create a new application container and

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:47,150
under half a second that's how fast this

00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:49,939
whole system operates and in response to

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,680
what your needs are here's the really

00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:53,779
cool thing how quickly can you then

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,090
register that application on the dynamic

00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:58,849
router and have it a live URL ready to

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,050
go same amount of time there's no other

00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:03,680
system in the world is built to scale

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,939
and respond that fast now if you want to

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,039
do an update to your system or add

00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:10,069
capacity how much of a downtime penalty

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,629
you have to pay zero this is what the

00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:13,789
operating an internet scale for

00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,289
continuous delivery is based around and

00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:16,460
Cloud Foundry is built to do it and

00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:20,120
that's why we're winning today as a

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,409
community so the whole purpose of having

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,870
this conference and starting to do it

00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:26,389
every six months is really simple it's

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,639
about scaling a community and it's not

00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:30,050
about me or any individual here it's

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,729
about all of us getting together every

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,680
six months to talk about how this

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:35,719
platform is changing what we need to

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,979
need to do to push it forward and how we

00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:38,360
can all move forward together as a

00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,620
community it was really as simple as

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,659
getting a bunch of smart people working

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,919
on this problem together in a room and

00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,629
seeing what happens and I'm really

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,490
excited to listen to the talks today so

00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:49,339
I wanted to thank Christopher Faris who

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,539
is in the audience from IBM because

00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:52,539
Chris and I spent a lot of time

00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,930
working on this and IBM was a huge

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,650
founding co-sponsor of this and part of

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,100
the reason why there's so many people

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,100
here today

00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,830
