00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,679
so here is my proposed topic how to

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,059
write a Cloud Foundry data service I'm a

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,560
director of engineering for Clive Henry

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,789
services and I'd love to tell you guys

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,750
about what we're changing and how you

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:29,490
could get started writing your own

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:32,130
service Toni I'm Toni hansman on the

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,540
Boche team at Cloud Foundry most of the

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,640
Bosch team will be hanging out talking

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:42,420
about bosch releases or other boshy

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:45,629
topics so my name is one c4corey I'm an

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,219
engineer at pivotal I'm helping

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,930
spearhead an effort to rewrite Health

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,170
Manager we're calling it Health Manager

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,030
9000 so I'll be kind of talking about

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,460
what health manager currently is what it

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,100
does or at least claims to do and some

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,730
of the directions were taking the

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,730
refactor slash rewrite

00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,810
[Music]

00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,610
so I'm not seeing enough non pivotal

00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,440
people in this line we've got summer

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,750
that's awesome so if you still out there

00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,220
and thinking we need I've got an idea I

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,159
want to talk to some people then come up

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,479
and subscribe all so I'm just a guy I'd

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,290
only to introduce myself

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:37,790
my topic is Cloud Foundry core - what

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:42,440
next question mark okay so um if you've

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:44,060
heard about boundary core yeah okay

00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,440
thank you I will

00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,940
so Claire boundary core was something we

00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,039
did last year where we were basically

00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,840
certifying cloud foundry vendors against

00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,850
the API set they provided and the the

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,720
set of services they provided but one of

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,220
the things we've done this year in

00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,720
version 2 is we've kind of decoupled the

00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,429
services so they're not kind of hosted

00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,659
on the cloud foundry now so before we

00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:01,340
kind of said if you have my sequel and

00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,979
reticent rabbit and stuff then your

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,360
Cloud Foundry core so we need to think I

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,830
think as a group about what Cloud

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,830
Foundry core means and how we certified

00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:12,819
you know distributions providers so

00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,819
that's what I would like to talk about

00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:25,790
ok so I've written a multi-site path

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:27,769
scares me any ideas so no one you know

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,799
is gonna carry on in the future running

00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:31,940
paths in a single datacenter there's

00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,290
lots of changes that need to be made

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,790
there's some people in their talks that

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,010
have already hinted that they've started

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,269
to run in ISPs and corporations and

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,680
they've already started to think about

00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:42,440
this they've started to work out how to

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,720
improve that I just really like to get

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,250
an idea of who's thinking about it who's

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,980
done what what mistakes have been made

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,269
you know who's broken things and kind of

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:57,340
start this discussion kind of moving

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:57,340
forward yay

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:04,549
hi I'm Alex work on the lager eater team

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,290
for COD foundry I'm just interested in

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:09,049
talking with people about it how to get

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,079
logs out of the system we just went to a

00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:15,940
limited beta on Friday so I'd like to

00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,940
get people's opinions

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,309
[Applause]

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,590
so on Heroku you can tail your logs or

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,840
you can drain your logs to another

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,470
system like Splunk or some analytic

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:40,439
system can give visibility into your

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:41,760
apps I've got that I've got a topic and

00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,599
then I'll give radiation topic and I'm

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,189
more interested know which of the two

00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,739
topics the more interesting one is

00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:48,540
what's in the deployment file and the

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,530
other is what's in the

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,209
deployment file and you know it might

00:03:52,530 --> 00:04:00,510
depend on how far you've got through

00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:04,579
that process so I don't want anyone

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,579
correcting my grammar on the use of the

00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:18,480
all right I recently was fiddling with a

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,100
local Cloud Foundry instance and apps

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,170
were not restarting the way that I

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,210
expected them to so I went and did a lot

00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,610
of deep diving and used a lot of tools

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,140
to figure out how a pree starting works

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,520
and I thought I might share what I've

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:34,920
learned with you on that tools using

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,920
some CF tools some plug-ins for that as

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:42,840
well as warden warden repple and warden

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:45,480
WSH warden shell yeah exactly

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,540
understanding app debugging and our app

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,560
restarting through the use of a handful

00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,560
of tools that will help you do that

00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,530
[Applause]

00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:10,770
hi I'm Tim also from petal I just wanted

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:13,620
to know how you guys monitor hi my name

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,660
is Joe Aldous I'm from VMware I work on

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,690
the identity components at Cloud Foundry

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,760
so I'm gonna have two talks one is

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,340
Identity Management

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,020
so I'll talk about two why we use it how

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,810
we use it how we create users manage

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,130
users groups all that stuff and you know

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,690
if there's more interest then we'll go

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,390
further and talk about like Active

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:42,890
Directory Integration LDAP sam'l - any

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:42,890
more right entity so interest all right

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,419
hi i'm bala from the support team of

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,610
Cloud Foundry so this is not my request

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:53,729
so I spoke to a few of the customers

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:57,390
here they said currently there is no way

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:59,490
where if there's our furry apps that

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,990
needs that are behind the firewall how

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,840
do they communicate with each other and

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,040
so we need VPN as a service in Cloud

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,040
Foundry so that's my request

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:29,190
that's a if you need support reach out

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:32,640
for support I'd love for Nicole hi I'm

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,930
Chris Faris from IBM James and I had a

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,630
little something to do with getting us

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,370
all together here if many of you may

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,250
have noticed I posted a blog on the

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,750
Cloud Foundry blog the other day talking

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,100
about community advisory boards so I

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,360
thought we'd maybe have a chat this

00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,700
afternoon about how do we make this

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,350
community work better how do we work

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,240
more closely with one another how do we

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,770
understand what's going on how do we

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,320
understand where we're taking this and

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,060
how do we decide who decides how to do

00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,860
that so I thought we'd have a little

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:07,560
chat about the community advisory board

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:10,710
and and taking this to the next level hi

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,020
my name is Dave Nielsen some of you may

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,270
have been to a cloud camp maybe not I'm

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:19,200
currently consulting over at HP cloud

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:21,930
and Christopher's topic was exactly what

00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,250
I wanted to propose but I found him so I

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,290
didn't have to pose it thank you for

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,870
proposing it and now I can propose my

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,480
true passion which is meetup groups user

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,070
groups how do we get our local

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,830
organization going

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,540
I run the Silicon Valley Cloud Foundry

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,250
meetup group having done a whole lot

00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,440
would like to do more I was wondering if

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,780
any of you would like to run a meetup

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,640
group or what have you want to call user

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,990
group anybody out there ok well ok

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,730
that's enough we can do that thank you

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:55,800
very much hi my name's Matt from

00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,480
strongloop so we'd like to talk today

00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,490
about how to build your own private

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,740
mobile backend as a service or ambass on

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,390
top of our open source node product

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:09,560
coming out here on the 20th called

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:09,560
loopback of course on Cloud Foundry

00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,390
maybe want to fathom a guess whatever

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,590
get on this piece of paper yeah so I

00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,540
just want to take the opportunity if

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,250
anybody has any interest at going

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,430
through either the CLI or the logger

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,650
Gator code base I have an iMac in the

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,660
back that I can set up so I'm proposing

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,370
we sit around we look at some code we

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,650
talk some details some of the patterns

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,150
we're using and go as I said earlier go

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,740
is not an object-oriented language so

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,330
there are some new patterns to play with

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,260
and stuff like that so if you'd like to

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,260
join me that would be awesome

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,600
so I was looking at mine and it says VPN

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,820
services which is similar to the one

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,640
over there but I'd really like to talk

00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,250
about also the private cloud and some of

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,900
the requirements to reach to get it to

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,920
work organizationally inside and that

00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,500
would include like some of the

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:18,070
firewalling network of legacy systems so

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:20,920
that's what it is so if you have a

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,990
pre-existing if you're trying to put

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,550
your cloud on a private network and then

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,530
you have pre-existing services that are

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,240
bound by at a network level that you

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,640
have to access from your cloud outbound

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,130
some of the challenges that you face is

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,960
you might want some services that have

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,060
access but other services that should

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,200
not have access to those which is part

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,210
of the requirements for having like a

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:47,050
VPN type service for the wording

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:48,640
containers themselves yeah from with it

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,380
from with inside the container itself

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,750
how you can control access to specific

00:09:50,380 --> 00:10:01,600
endpoints whereas others are blocked

00:09:52,750 --> 00:10:03,070
access to those endpoints suite I think

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,900
my name is Andre your kitchen with

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,480
altars called front row consultancy I

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,830
would like to suggest a topic around

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,890
that way is the song called foundry

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,780
everybody knows that not deploying

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,660
database and working with the debasement

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,610
cloud for is a bit tricky task and there

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,070
were suggestion to do something with

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:26,130
stored procedures by the speaker

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:30,000
yesterday so I would like to

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:33,220
Teresa Teresa topic about roadmap which

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,090
now which databases are most in demand a

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:42,970
sequel no sequel new sequel and what's

00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:53,080
what's what what happens next with the

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:56,950
dabassisst one Cloud Foundry thanks

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:59,980
Andrey my name is Renaud the subject I

00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:02,650
would like to propose is integration of

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,130
mobile platform development platforms

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:09,310
such as up celebrator PhoneGap titanium

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,300
as well as back-end as a service how to

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,850
approach it

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:17,050
which ones make more sense to integrate

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,070
should we slice and dice them into

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:25,030
individual services or do a more drop-in

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:27,370
approach those use cases and everything

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,380
surrounding integration of mobile

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:36,690
development platforms and back-end as a

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:36,690
service in - quad foundry Thanks

00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:49,410
I'm Michael Serkan from Hoover software

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:54,389
and I would like to propose talking

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:57,089
about dotnet support on for Cloud

00:11:54,389 --> 00:12:00,990
Foundry we've built some gurus built

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:03,179
some native dotnet de a's and windows

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,519
code and Bausch agents and we'd love to

00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,110
hear from people what what they think

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,740
about that whether it's useful or not

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:13,019
and we've also built Cloud Foundry did

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,679
for Cloud Foundry - we've done this and

00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,569
also for deploying for managing Cloud

00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,730
Foundry deployments and generating bosh

00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:22,199
manifests and we'd like to see what

00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,740
direction people would like us to take

00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:28,199
the building our Bosh management and our

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,800
dotnet support and Microsoft sequel

00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:33,870
support for Cloud Foundry -
