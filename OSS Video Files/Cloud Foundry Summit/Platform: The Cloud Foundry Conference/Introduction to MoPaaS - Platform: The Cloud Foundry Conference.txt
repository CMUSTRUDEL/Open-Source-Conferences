[Music]

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:14,610
today I'm going to talk about the public

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:18,449
past surveys Moe pass we are offering in

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:23,490
China and the first the online and I

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:27,240
first briefly reveal about ancora and

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,880
then why called family-based pass in

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,160
China and then we'll go through all the

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,829
detail about the introduction and kora

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,710
as I said is a leading provider of cloud

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,730
foundry based path solution in China and

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:45,360
we offer both Club app engine for the

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,579
developers as a public pass offer in

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,649
addition we also create interning in the

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,590
cloud platform for the enterprise and

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,280
the service provider as a private cloud

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,559
solution

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,170
there's no printer why we need pass

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:04,739
because this is why there are some large

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:07,770
account the pet market in China the main

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:12,030
driver is mobile and there so this what

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:15,780
I see about today pass is a very small

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,939
portion of the cloud service market

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,060
however we was we are very optimistic

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,240
about the past future there are quite a

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,490
few the mobile app requirements

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,710
particularly for the mobile developers

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,820
there are some common services we need

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,979
to provide the first is a mobile search

00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,200
social networks and also we need to take

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,390
in the consideration of the devices and

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,100
also the communications requirement for

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,460
the push notification and other services

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,189
and also there are quite a few popular

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,600
apps mobile apps in China including QQ

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:54,450
WeChat and we need to take care of this

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,939
there is a new area called back end as a

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,700
service and which a lightweight build

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,700
where between the application and also

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,670
the infrastructure however what about

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,649
the escape scalability what about the

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,860
poor ability and it is we need

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,690
additional help obviously Cloud Foundry

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,650
can do that we should call foundry

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,209
because of

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,549
platform accessibility because we what

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:22,900
incorporates all the necessary mobile

00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:25,120
services into our past offering and also

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,819
we need the multiple cloud support just

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,430
like dearest's the previous speaker

00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:32,799
talking about how to provide the past

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,269
service across different as this is our

00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:38,859
well called the intelligent cloud

00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:43,030
platform impasse is a path based

00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:45,579
solution which will manage the the the

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:48,340
ASP oh and they also provide nice

00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:52,680
service to the applications including

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:56,650
provide public SAS or app and also the

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,829
provider internal apps platform as a

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,370
private cloud edition data service and

00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:05,709
that development at the testing platform

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,290
this is our public the website for our

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:13,359
public cloud pass which could come up as

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:18,760
more action is a path for mobile so we

00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:23,319
use as I said the co-founder is our core

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,389
building core we we have on top is the

00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,060
mobile service extension including mode

00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,919
the the some common mobile service like

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,370
push notifications social networks

00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:36,129
location service voice and cetera and

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:40,209
also we integrate the hot dog based data

00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:43,599
service into our platform for example

00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,940
MapReduce storage systems data

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:51,129
processing lock analysis and also

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:53,500
clustering services addition we also

00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:57,400
turn to the third-party services so we

00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:00,310
we integrate them into our more paths as

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,769
I mentioned earlier and we need

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,530
requirement to support multiple ass so

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,840
so pacing there's our our more past

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,139
picture yeah addition to the enhancement

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,069
what we do on top of call foundry we

00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:17,320
provide the web web console to provide

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:19,690
good user experience and the user

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,349
console we also do a lot of measurement

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,659
stuff other feature I need mention is we

00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:27,470
we support a lot of mobile services

00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:32,330
integrating into the cloud foundry

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:34,310
and and also some data services so this

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,040
is how we integrate for the mapper do

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:40,700
service into cloud foundry and that we

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,190
used the mechanism for the like service

00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:47,860
gaze away I think in the future we need

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,860
to use the service broker as I learned

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,170
for the mobile service

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,660
what we offer is a including that we

00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:02,330
support and a different mobile platform

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:04,520
like Android iPhone and also data alike

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,370
in my cycle MongoDB and some other data

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,730
store also the external service like the

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,850
s3 pacino a similar s3 offering in China

00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:19,280
other communications like push

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:22,270
notification shown message email geo geo

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,450
location services social service

00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:30,530
integrated with Weibo is a microblog

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:33,290
service in China as widget addition we

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:36,760
need provide mobile analytics to provide

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:39,740
the analyst data allows to the developer

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,130
so this is how we integrate the mobile

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,919
service into into Cloud Foundry again we

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,500
use Gateway mechanism to extend this

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,180
service to include all the these

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,870
services either provided by ourselves

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:58,610
with our mobile service server or the

00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:01,490
third-party services to provide all the

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,620
necessary feature offered by current

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:08,150
back-end as a mobile backend as a

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:12,440
service so in summary what we have for

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:14,510
the for the for the more pass is in

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,480
heading the platform between e clean a

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:22,700
lot of paid service into into our

00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:27,140
platform and also we trainer this pass

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:31,780
to the to the mobile application we

00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:34,880
leverage they wanted the CRO foundry

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:38,690
agility to streamline the app lifecycle

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,389
management in addition because we are

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:44,539
open platform so they are known

00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:48,110
and we have extensive we have some

00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:51,020
accessibility to attend our service to a

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:56,479
lot of other services to meet the need

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:58,729
our user and the secure phase both we in

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,979
the infrastructure level and also

00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:04,219
offered by the cloud foundry so what's

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:05,689
next so we were first because what I

00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:07,400
talk about is based on cloud foundry

00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:09,139
words in one and if they were going to

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,569
operate our more path service to

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:14,840
California version 2 and also as some

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:18,110
other more pass enhancement including

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,389
the Baltic cloud support mobile service

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:26,180
enhancement and data services and also

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:28,729
the platform management so we are our

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:32,330
companies in Shanghai area and also we

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:35,820
have our office in in Silicon Valley so

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,300
that's that's it thank you very much

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,449
[Applause]

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,449
