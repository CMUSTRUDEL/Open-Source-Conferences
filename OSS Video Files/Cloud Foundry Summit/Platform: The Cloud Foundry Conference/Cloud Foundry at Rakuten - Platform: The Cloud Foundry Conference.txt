my name is the okay Sasaki from Japan

00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:17,279
let me introduce them myself under my

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,590
company and I give up talk about our

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,460
crowdfunding in two instances in our

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,710
company first of all the I'm a read

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,580
developer or brockton platform as a

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,590
service and I'm very fond of many

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,160
open-source projects like apache couchdb

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:38,010
Ruby on Rails and nodejs and also the

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,320
I'm of power of the country in a member

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,620
of the Japanese local committee for

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,960
crowd funder JP and also I manage the

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,079
crowdfunding instances at my home to

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,960
manage my applications about rockton the

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:56,039
rear the global internet service company

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,789
the many businesses around in Japan the

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,399
picture shows all of the our domestic

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,240
businesses there from the affiliated

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,790
works the pictures and the golf course

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,869
reservations and so from security

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,299
insurance and the main of our main

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:20,280
business is ecommerce services called

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:23,280
rakta ichiba and we have in Japan that

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,909
we have the southern developers and more

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,439
than 70 teams and every week we deployed

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:34,650
many applications in the week and we are

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,470
going to the globalize our company so

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,479
that we started the Robards with the

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,040
special project called english in

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:46,799
addition that this means very strange

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,470
cultures but I'm very fond of this

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,820
product for the Englishmen ization means

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,530
to use English even in Japan so that we

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,960
I worked at Japan

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,689
but I can't speak Japanese in our office

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,509
so we need to speak English with

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:07,610
everyone so that you can join our

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,610
company without any barrier of language

00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:14,150
we've started the rocket and protomatter

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:17,540
service we call it our past two years

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,030
ago and this is our private cloud

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,470
services that we deployed crowdfund

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:28,569
River even on-premise environment and we

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:31,130
started from the 2011 December and

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,720
support from develop development

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,200
environment to production environments

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,660
so now the several services running in

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,459
the production environment on top of our

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:47,090
platform as a service and why we choose

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:50,269
currently there were the three factors

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,840
folder we measure the platform of the

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:55,310
service

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,830
the main purpose is reducing cost on the

00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,750
infrastructure operations and also the

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,680
easy to deploy for application

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:06,620
developers and more about that we our

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,050
business expand to grovel we need to do

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:13,250
applications not only in Japan but also

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:15,260
in Europe America so so that we need to

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,530
provide a transparency on the

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,670
infrastructure because

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,480
infrastructure person is different in

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,820
Japan and Europe so that a bit difficult

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,610
to the same issue to have a same

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:35,360
infrastructure so they're providing the

00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:39,560
our path folder for the purpose for the

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:43,910
infrastructure transparency so as a

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,250
result the we have a big change the our

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:50,120
traditional development process is on

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,850
left side the developer asked the

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,120
infrastructure team to build a service

00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:58,670
that maker VMs and install middle-earth

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,220
and so on the configure the road viruses

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:05,480
and so so there are a lot of the

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:08,290
workflows in our company but after we

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,840
introduced our bus with cloud foundry

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,959
the developer just said push his

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,510
applications so the purpose we provide

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,359
our path commands like the CF commands

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,360
the developer uses our past push

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,669
to deploy the applications so the some

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,860
of the developers integrate the command

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:31,490
line tool with the junkies so that

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,219
everything in the development process is

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:38,360
automated to the deployment other

00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:41,210
results from actual users they save the

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,900
infrastructure operation cost which is

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:51,080
reducing the 90% so that this is this

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:53,509
was big change for us so the I recommend

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,939
the overall interest our team to use

00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:59,270
cross country to reduce the such a cost

00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:00,800
and also them the most benefit is not

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,680
only for application developers but also

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,210
for us that infrastructure engineers to

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,340
develop the new things for

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:13,610
infrastructures and we are still on the

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:16,279
crowdfunding very balanced system there

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,710
is historical reasons for that the

00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,560
middle range is a safe River Rhine and

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,860
the top is safe between lines and the

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,400
bottom is our our path lines the at

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:32,330
first we started to integrate our

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,789
authentication system to the our purpose

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:38,659
so that we integrated with utterson

00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:40,729
crowd and next we are integrating our

00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:44,629
logging infrastructure on top of

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:47,870
currently so that we need makeup

00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:51,050
governance for the logins for e-commerce

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,620
and also that we support to provide the

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,889
latest crustal with using sentinels and

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:01,210
also to integrate with graphics this is

00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:04,039
a massacre compatible Opera Software

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:07,069
practices I recommend the affirmed the

00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:10,969
who started use crowd fund reader as we

00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:13,610
did use a crowd country as a cannon not

00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:15,650
the free stock software so the pick up

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,900
the crowd fund recounted that da the

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,589
crowd controls health managers and

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,800
routers so the and clarified the what

00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:27,889
crowdfunding does and what does not

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,050
support so the I think the well

00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:32,959
supported part is the application

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,550
runtimes so now that the British system

00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,210
support the build parks so that

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:41,720
easy-to-access extent to the runtimes

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:44,659
and also the please be careful about

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,659
need improvement parts the cutters are

00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:49,759
crossed out dead set and also the

00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:51,830
monitoring the logging the wrapping we

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,400
have a lot of their focuses on that

00:06:51,830 --> 00:07:00,050
system and now we are focusing on the

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:02,330
more web features like flex week or it's

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,000
flexible routing like a motor react

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:08,210
feature this is useful for the AV

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,330
testing or SEO marketing of and so on

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,819
and also the trying to integrate

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,650
database platform as a service and also

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,780
the optimizing the market in the center

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,940
deployment because we have a multiple

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,159
data centers in different locations so

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,889
that we need to optimize the deployment

00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:27,740
of those crowdfund rates and the finally

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:32,090
that we need to fill the gap of the with

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:35,090
our system with the CF quits at rush the

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:39,440
more details we can have a technical

00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:43,280
conference that October 26 that this

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,800
site is techno truck 10.0 TP is also the

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,759
part on the our platform as a service so

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,159
you can access that the still that we

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,590
are constructing so the priest reach for

00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:57,250
the updates so thank you for favorite

00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,250
thank you very much
