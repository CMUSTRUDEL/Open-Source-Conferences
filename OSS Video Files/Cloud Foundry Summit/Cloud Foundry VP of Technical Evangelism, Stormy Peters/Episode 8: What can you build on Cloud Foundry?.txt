	Two Protons and a Cloud is a weekly, live dialogue connecting industry experts to the online technical community. For developers by developers and only 20 minutes …there’s no excuse to miss it. 

This week, we are combining evangelism forces and talking with Stormy Peters, VP of technical evangelism at the Cloud Foundry Foundation. Not only do we watch her Cloud Foundry Morning Edition every week, but we’ve also participated in some great activities the Cloud Foundry Foundation has put on. We’ll get an update on what’s been happening with the Foundation and a few CF use cases and project updates. 

And don't forget! We are announcing our first  #HPEHelionApp  contest winner live during the show.
