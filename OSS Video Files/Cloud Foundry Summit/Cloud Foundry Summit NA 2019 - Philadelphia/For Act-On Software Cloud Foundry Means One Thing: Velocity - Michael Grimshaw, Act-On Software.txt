	For Act-On Software Cloud Foundry Means One Thing: Velocity - Michael Grimshaw, Act-On Software

If velocity is the speed of something in a given direction, then in the startup sector that need for speed is in the direction of providing innovative software to our customers.

Fast innovation while navigating resource limitations is the name of the game.

With Pivotal Cloud Foundry:
The POC took less than 3 days.
Services were deployed to Act-On's Staging environment in under a month.
...all with only a single Engineer devoted to the project.

Cloud Foundry allows Act-On Software to focus resources on our software business by providing us with speed in security, speed in stability and speed in scalability.

In a word? Velocity
