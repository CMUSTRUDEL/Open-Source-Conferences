Description: 
	Extending Cloud Foundry at Scale - Addressing the Non-12-factor App Gap with CFCR - Colby Johnston & Brett Mayer, Comcast

For many years Comcast has been successfully running and managing Cloud Foundry for stateless applications and micro-services at scale. Over time, we have had to address the requirements of our non-12-factor apps as well. We have chosen Container Runtime (CFCR) platform for these stateful applications by deploying multi-site / multi-cloud environments. As an extension of Cloud Foundry Application Runtime, it allows customers to do self service deployments and scaling of application stacks and make use of additional features such as service catalog/market place, eternal DNS and persistent storage. Join us to learn and provide feedback on how we have leveraged Bosh and Concourse to efficiently and predictably deploy and manage CFCR at scale.
