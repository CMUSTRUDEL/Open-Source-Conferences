Description: 
	My First BOSH Release - Rebecca Putinski & Peter Tran, Pivotal

BOSH is a tool that unifies release engineering, deployment, and lifecycle management of small and large-scale cloud software by enabling operators deploy software over hundreds of VMs. But how do you get started with packaging your product so it can be deployed, versioned, and managed by BOSH? With BOSH releases, of course! A BOSH release is a versioned collection of configuration properties and templates, start-up scripts, source code, binary artifacts, and everything else required to build and deploy software in a reproducible way. In this talk, we will take you through the process of bringing a new BOSH release to life. We will demonstrate how to create a new release with dependencies and source code, and youâ€™ll learn about the lifecycle hooks BOSH provides for release authors.
