through all the different submissions

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,150
that we had and it was really hard to

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,359
choose the different the different talks

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:26,970
because they were all really so good

00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:29,010

focusing on large enterprises embracing

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,379
open source obviously that's a theme

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,940
through the conference for me I'm

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,100
passionate about focusing on putting

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:04,260
humans back into technology which is why
