Description: 
	Reliability Engineering for Humans - Hannah Foxwell, Pivotal

The concepts and practices of site reliability engineering are changing the way we build and operate our platforms and enabling us to have more meaningful conversations about availability, service-level objectives, and cost. But what are the benefits for the engineer holding the pager? Can we add a human element to our error budgets?

Join Hannah Foxwell to look at site reliability engineering practices through a human lens. Hannah combines SRE with HumanOps and explains how to use SRE practices to improve the health and well-being of your team.

welcome to Cloud Foundry for business

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,220
our second talk is Hana Foxwell from

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,219
pivotal talking about reliability

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,410
engineering for humans this talk is also

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,529
pretty cool because Denise is going to

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:21,750
be live sketchnoting this talk so if you

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,609
go to denis.df apps at i/o it will pop

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,250
up a zoom channel where you can watch

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:34,760
your sketch now but also make sure

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:36,719
you're paying attention to Hannah yeah

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,170
Hannah's not going to answer questions

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,059
after in like Q&A format so if you have

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:49,649
any questions feel free to come up and

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:51,989
grab her after great take it away talk

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,629
about reliability engineering for humans

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,309
or to put it another way is site

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,770
reliability engineering good for you

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,050
so I want to start today by talking a

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,629
little bit about why I became interested

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,810
in sree and sre practices because when

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,360
Google published the sre book in 2016

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,360
this is what I heard you don't need sre

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,180
unless the other size of Google and so I

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,680
pretty much ignored it for the next two

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,100
years until something changed my mind

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,630
after the asari book was published I

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,350
noticed some ripple effects happening in

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:33,630
the DevOps community so previously where

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:37,920
we kind of called our team's ops or our

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:42,570
teammates operators they then became the

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,780
DevOps team and the awful job title of

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,430
DevOps engineer came into being and then

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,200
I noticed they're actually all of these

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,090
people were being rebranded again and

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,579
they were becoming site reliability

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,880
engineers and I was like ok fair enough

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,680
naming things is hard and I'm a bit of a

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,430
traditionalist and I've always believed

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,719
that DevOps is not a job title so

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,969
rebranding these teams to site

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,849
reliability engineers that kind of made

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,489
sense to me and that was really my

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,110
experience of sree until the beginning

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,930
of 2018

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,870
when I joined pivotal and I was on a

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,540
call with pager duty and our cloud ops

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,810
team and we were looking we were looking

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:29,490
into the data that pager Duty had

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,980
collected about how pivotal the cloud

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,500
ops team within pivotal we're responding

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,570
to incidents and managing their managing

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,760
their own call and page duty have this

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,670
dashboard called operations health

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,670
management and it derives a health score

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,470
from all of all of your kind of alerting

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,370
all of the incidents that come through

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,930
from your platform to pager duty and it

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,730
takes into account things like actually

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,470
how many times were you paged out of

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,420
hours how many times was your sleep

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,520
disrupted how many times was your

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,520
evening at home disrupted and how many

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,020
of these incidents were resolved quickly

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,030
without intervention and how many of

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,570
these incidents were real incidents that

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,459
impacted your uses and what the data is

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,070
showing you right here so this line at

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,530
the top it's showing the the the health

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,810
score derived from all of those aspects

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,420
the amount of kind of human impact of

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,330
those uncle routines improved

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,660
dramatically through the course of 2017

00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,750
so it starts just above 20 as a health

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,430
score which is really really bad I hope

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,310
there's no a focus on cloud ops team

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,720
here I'm gonna say sorry

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:42,239
it was really really bad in 2017 but it

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,049
improved dramatically - we've got a

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,040
health score of over 90 by the end of

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:50,430
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,590
so to like kind of summarize it and show

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,239
it in a more simple way the things that

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,560
we saw happen over the course of those

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,690
12 months were improved team health mean

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,540
time to acknowledge incidents was down

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:07,590
and mean time to recover from incidents

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,239
was down and so we asked the question

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,560
and he - page of duty were on this call

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,510
with us and they said what the hell did

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,109
you guys do over that 12 months that

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,600
made such a dramatic improvement and

00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:22,970
part of the answer was implementing sre

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,080
practices so sre you have my attention

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,670
maybe there's something in this maybe

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,680
maybe

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,480
something that I need to I need to start

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,680
reached researching maybe it's something

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,570
but I need to be reading about and part

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,110
of my interest in it was genuinely the

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,940
human impact of good practices because

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,440
I'm involved in a community called human

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:48,860
ops human ops was founded in 2016 by

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,080
server density and it was aimed to being

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,480
a community and a movement that promotes

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,850
more sustainable working practices

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,130
within IT operations because there's a

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,320
very real health impact when you

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,170
implement poor practices no sleep

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,830
deprivation and stress and anxiety can

00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:10,160
have a very real human impact on the

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,300
teeth on the people in the team I always

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,710
like to say when you think about the

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,640
health impacts of sleep deprivation you

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,140
know you're talking about diabetes

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,760
you're talking about cardiovascular

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,850
disease you're talking about high blood

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,190
pressure these are unacceptable side

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:28,100
effects of supporting your platform in

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,620
production and human ops was created to

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,150
share better practices better ways of

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,440
doing things and to try and address this

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,160
problem that we have in the industry

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,810
today one of the tenets of human ops is

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,930
that the well-being of human operators

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,400
impacts the reliability of systems and

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,460
we all kind of instinctively know that

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,560
to be true and from what I'd seen about

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:53,390
sre so far at this point made me believe

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,790
that sre practices could improve the

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,040
well-being of the human operators and as

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:02,390
a result improve the reliability of the

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:05,270
systems that they were supporting there

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,980
is a lot of content available about oh

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,680
sorry there are three whole books I

00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,590
could not hope to cover all of all of

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,350
the all of the information that is

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,150
available about sre in this 30-minute

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,590
talk today but what I'm going to do is

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,480
I'm going to give you the basics the

00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,270
fundamentals of SRA and I'm going to

00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,040
look at them through a human lens I'm

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,900
not going to talk about how to improve

00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,430
the health of your platform but I am

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,380
going to talk about how to improve the

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,770
health and well-being of the team that

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,700
are supporting that platform

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:39,910
[Music]

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:42,730
so sre as it was defined by google is

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,470
what happens when a software engineer is

00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,140
tasked with what used to be called

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,180
operations and we are going through an

00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,590
evolution in operations because we're

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,120
going through an evolution in our

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,480
businesses we are more and more

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,340
dependent on software and on software

00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,920
services and on the platforms that run

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,360
underneath them to actually operate our

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,070
businesses to actually serve our users

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,580
day in day out and so getting better at

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,510
this

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,100
is important it's business critical we

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:18,580
can't continue to do things the way

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:20,200
we've always done one of the fundamental

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,780
aspects of SRA

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,280
is the acceptance the failure is normal

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:29,500
any system of any reasonable complexity

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,500
will experience some kind of failure at

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,220
some point in time we need to change our

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,050
focus from being purely preventative

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,390
ignoring the failure is going to happen

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,150
to our team and actually embrace it as

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,950
part of our normal day to day beta day

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,600
life at work failure is going to happen

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:51,970
but saying that reliability is

00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,190
fundamental to whatever service you're

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,530
providing whether that be to your

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,360
customers to your colleagues internally

00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,460
whether you're supporting a platform

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,500
that serves your application developers

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,800
the reliability of the service you

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,970
provide is fundamental to its success

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,950
you're not going to be able to delight

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:13,830
your users with new features if your

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:16,870
service is down and the velocity of

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,760
delivery is increasingly important we

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:23,020
want to be able to experiment we want to

00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,250
be able to prove prove the value of new

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,970
features and we want to be able to do

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,770
that quickly in a production environment

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,180
but here I am saying that reliability is

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,680
fundamental so surely we should be

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,660
slowing down surely we should be more

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,550
careful but surely having a service

00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,410
available is better than nothing at all

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,849
even if it doesn't have all of the new

00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,719
features that we're all so excited about

00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:47,200
shipping so how do we reconcile these

00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:49,960
really two opposing aims

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,270
sorry gives us some tools that help us

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,090
do that so I'm going to talk very

00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,700
briefly about SL eyes SL owes and era

00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:00,550
budgets because these three things

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:06,040
really for me are the core of s re

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:12,430
practices an SLO is a service level

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:15,070
objective and a hundred percent is not

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,540
your objective not even the Internet

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,130
delivered through your ISP and

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,590
especially not through by your mobile

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,990
device is a hundred percent available if

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:26,250
the internet isn't 100% available then

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,990
why should you be endeavoring to me so

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:32,800
when you think of it in that way a small

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,930
amount of failure is acceptable it

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,120
should be expected and it's it's that

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,600
amount of acceptable failure even if

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,980
it's very small that we want to talk

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,600
about as in the context of SRA it's

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,660
important because we need to be able to

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,170
have sensible and realistic ex-con ver

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,390
say shion's

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:57,310
about reliability and how much we need

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:59,560
to invest in improving reliability SL is

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:03,160
or service level indicators is how we

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:07,360
measure whether we're serving our users

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,640
correctly and you need your SL ice to be

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,350
unambiguous you don't want to be in the

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,840
middle of an incident arguing over

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,700
whether or not your users care about the

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,070
metrics that you're observing they need

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,230
to be as user centric as possible if

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,760
you're not meaty if you're measuring

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,840
your service level indicators and it's

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,600
saying that you're not providing the

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,980
service you need to then that should be

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,330
that should be a black and white

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,710
decision so spending some time and

00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,840
defining your service level indicators

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:39,760
so that their user centric is really

00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:42,490
important and then finally era budget so

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,620
era budget is the inverse of your

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,510
service level objective so if you have a

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,590
service level objective of say four

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:54,820
nines 99.99% availability that means

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:57,220
you've got a 0.01 percent error budget

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,380
this is the amount of acceptable failure

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,529
within your system and that's really

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,660
important

00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:05,720
because now you have something that you

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,699
can measure and you can you can embrace

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,860
failure as a normal part of your day job

00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:12,470
you say am i still within my error

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,519
budget and if I am then that's okay

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,839
because actually we've had a

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,850
conversation about this and then we've

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:21,829
agreed that a hundred percent is not our

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:24,740
target and also if you exceed your error

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:26,120
budget if you're if you're supporting

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,459
your platform and you're not able to

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,670
meet your service level objective and

00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,800
everybody has agreed an unambiguous way

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,360
of measuring whether or not you're

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,160
succeeding to meet that target and

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,139
you've observed from the data that

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,430
you're not able to do it you can have a

00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:45,949
very real conversation a data based

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,509
conversation about investing in more

00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:50,990
reliability about doing things

00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:52,370
differently instead of it being instead

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,870
of it being based on feelings and

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,309
emotions you're actually saying well

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,850
we've agreed that this is the level that

00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:00,319
our users need and so we need to do

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,110
something differently to meet our user

00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,579
needs I'm going to go through each of

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,839
these concepts in a little bit more

00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,040
detail with some of the practices you

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,829
might want to implement behind the

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,959
scenes so we've established that a

00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:17,569
hundred percent availability is not your

00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:19,699
target so what is your target I like to

00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:22,100
reason about availability in terms of

00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,449
time and in to reason about an error

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,339
budget in terms of time because I think

00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:27,889
when you're getting started with sre

00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:29,300
time is a concept that everybody can

00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:31,910
understand you don't have to measure

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,670
your error budget in time though but

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,850
when you do you can see you can already

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:40,579
see some of the areas that you might

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,120
want to consider investing in so if your

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:45,920
SLO is 99.99 if it's four nines then

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,699
your error budget over a thirty day

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,259
period is four point three two minutes

00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:54,529
that's not really enough time for a

00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:55,910
human being to intervene when something

00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:58,459
goes wrong that's not really enough time

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:02,209
for your pages to go off for you to you

00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:03,860
know say say your say say you're in bed

00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:05,870
for you to like get up out of bed

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,920
log in and open your laptop you're not

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,350
going to be able to resolve that

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,790
incident in four point three two minutes

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,100
or you might be able to if you're very

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,089
lucky so as soon as you get above like

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,370
four nines

00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,870
as a service level objective you're

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,930
thinking you need to be thinking about

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:23,930
engineering high levels of automated

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:27,230
recovery and automated failover this is

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,329
an investment in your time and with and

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,370
in extra resources for resiliency in

00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:32,899
your platform and now you can have that

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,779
conversation you can say well actually

00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,970
is that extra line of availability worth

00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:44,120
that extra money that I need to invest

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:46,639
in the platform to get there you need to

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,040
agree these metrics with everyone you

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,920
need to ingry agree and I'm big USS lis

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,480
with everyone you need to agree your

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,009
service level objectives with everyone

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,899
these are not concepts that can live

00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:59,809
solely in your operations team and not

00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,639
go any further if your business

00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:03,319
stakeholders are unhappy then maybe your

00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,559
SLO is not defined correctly and you

00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:08,329
need to revisit them everyone needs to

00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,160
understand the importance of reliability

00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:11,449
it's not about shipping features as

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,509
quickly as possible if you're degrading

00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:16,569
the experience for your users beyond the

00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:18,709
point where your service is usable

00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,610
everyone understands the error budget

00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:21,379
and how it works

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,939
because when you exceed that error but

00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:24,589
you need to do things differently you

00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:28,029
either need to slow down or you need to

00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:29,929
invest in higher levels of resiliency

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:35,179
everyone needs to understand these new

00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:37,189
rules and then of course sometimes

00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:41,329
failure will happen you broke something

00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:42,920
what now actually because we knew that

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:45,410
failure was inevitable and because we

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,990
prepared for that failure we've got good

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,550
practices and sre advocates for a lot of

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,160
really good practices around actually

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,470
what you do to prepare for failure and

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,490
to deal with failure when it does happen

00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:00,620
so you know rehearsing how you respond

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,449
to incidents having playbooks

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,769
so that you don't have to make it up on

00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:08,629
the spot practice do fire drills and

00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,819
then afterwards do a blameless incident

00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:12,170
review and take the learning and take

00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:13,879
that incident as a learning opportunity

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,519
so that it doesn't happen again

00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,050
and then obviously review your error

00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,910
budget how much of the error budget have

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,379
we burnt through and how much is

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,360
remaining do we need to do something

00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:27,350
different right now so that we don't

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,860
disappoint our users if you take nothing

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,779
else

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,730
from this talk today I want I want you

00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:33,980
to go away with an understanding of

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,380
those three concepts as fundamental to

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,940
us our apprentices you need to set your

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,370
service level objectives and they need

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,860
to be realistic you need to measure your

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,860
service level indicators unambiguously

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,690
and with your users in mind and you need

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,310
to enforce your era budgets if you've

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,660
agreed that there is an acceptable

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:56,089
amount of failure then you need to

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:57,680
enforce that but as with everything the

00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,529
only the only way to start doing

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,200
something is to start doing it badly and

00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:04,910
practice the only one normal way to

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:10,220
begin speaking a new language just to

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:12,769
begin speaking it badly so if you do

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,420
want to incubate these practices and

00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:16,970
these processes within your ops team

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,440
initially until you feel confident about

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,640
explaining to them to your business

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,410
stakeholders then that's okay

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,850
but I would always encourage you that

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,200
these are not things that are needs to

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,329
remain within your platform team these

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,279
are not concerns that only affects

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,870
operations these are can these are

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:35,240
things that impact your business and

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:38,000
your users so you're just starting out

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,820
with sre practices and you've never

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,760
really measured your availability in an

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,260
unambiguous way before you don't really

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,399
know what your error budget should be

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:51,800
and that's okay I actually just make a

00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:55,220
start and iterate on it

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,930
aspirational s loz aspirational

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,250
objectives are okay because you know

00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,540
where you're heading for and you can

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,579
have good conversations about the

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,949
investment needed in both time and money

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:05,780
and extra resources to get yourself to a

00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:12,740
level of reliability that your users

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:16,160
expect however overachieving on your

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,919
objectives is less ok so say your target

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,809
was three nines 99.9% available and

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,419
actually you're achieving five nines

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,819
because you know it's a mature platform

00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:27,770
you've fixed most of like the nickels

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:31,010
it's just it's just running it's really

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:34,370
healthy what could you be doing

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,200
differently what could you be doing

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,490
differently with that era budget what

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,650
could you be doing differently to save

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,630
your company money what could have you

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,130
over provisioned your environment

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,970
have you got unnecessary levels of

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,440
complexity what happens if some people

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,930
in your team leave can they still

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,490
support it five nines of availability or

00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,560
is there a lot of lip a lot of

00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:57,830
organizational knowledge within certain

00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,420
individuals it's a risk if you're

00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,490
overachieving on your SLA so I would

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,410
encourage you to always use that error

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,450
budget to experiment even if it's just

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:12,470
to run fire drills and to practice your

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:14,510
practice your incident response we need

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,060
to make a commitment not to over invest

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,370
and over complicate our platforms beyond

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,820
what is required to our businesses it's

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:25,070
very easy to feel afraid of failures and

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,510
incidents and outages because that's

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,310
that's the environment that we've grown

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,760
up in every failure has been viewed as a

00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:33,560
catastrophe but actually when we do over

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,330
invest and every single business I've

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,210
worked with has over provisioned their

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:40,820
hardware so dramatically it's it's kind

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,080
of it's it's kind of hilarious and kind

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,670
of troubling when you think about the

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,030
amount of redundant resources that are

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,680
sat around in our data centers today by

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,020
over investing we don't only waste time

00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:54,170
and resources and money right now but we

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,210
waste time and money and resources for

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,030
the duration of that platform's

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,860
existence every time you over complicate

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,690
or over engineer a solution you're going

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,110
to pay for in the maintenance of that

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:10,760
over over the life cycle until it's

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:14,630
decommissioned best tweet of the year so

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,210
far in my opinion a DevOps engineer

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,940
walks into a bar puts the bartender in a

00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,290
docker container puts kubernetes behind

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:26,360
the bar and spins up a thousand

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:28,880
bartenders orders one beer so this this

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,740
to me completely serve as a reason why

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,200
so many people estates with so many

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:37,490
people because we love to play with the

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,530
shiny new thing we love to we love to

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,960
try new tools and technologies we have

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:45,320
an awful tendency for over engineering

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,970
and actually every time we do that we're

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,170
impacting our business because the time

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,230
and the resources and the money that

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:53,470
you're using to over engineer those

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,280
solutions could be spent on innovating

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,710
for your users

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:03,980
be spent on building new businesses and

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:06,110
experimenting so I've talked a lot about

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,730
data and metrics I've talked a bit about

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,740
money but I haven't talked a lot about

00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,300
the humans yet so apologies for that and

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,800
I'm gonna get on the hook I'm gonna get

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:19,090
to the hub now I want to start by

00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,850
talking about psychological safety so

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:25,280
psychological safety is defined as a

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:28,130
shared belief that a team is safe for

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,950
interpersonal risk-taking and another

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,240
definition is that psychological safety

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,340
is a belief that one will not be

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,290
punished or humiliated for speaking up

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,450
with ideas questions concerns or

00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,580
mistakes and it's been shown that

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,730
psychological safety is incredibly

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:47,150
important for team effectiveness Amy

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:51,440
Edmondson study based in a medical

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:53,390
context in a hospital found that there

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,150
was a correlation between psychological

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:59,600
safety error rates and team performance

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:02,180
and in in the context of delivering

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,950
delivering medical care you know team

00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,020
performance is patient outcomes we're

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,310
talking about practices that make the

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,480
difference between life and death in

00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:13,490
some cases it was found that actually

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,700
higher psychological safety correlated

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:19,190
to higher error rates so the more safe

00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,250
people felt the higher the error rates

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:24,740
within their department however higher

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,070
error rates correlated to higher team

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,960
performance and better patient outcomes

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:33,140
so there was an there was an inverse

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,960
correlation between error rates and team

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:39,140
performance and the reason was was the

00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:42,020
teams that showed had low psychological

00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,700
safety had the same amount of errors as

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,250
everyone else they were just less able

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,980
to talk about it less able to to raise

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:51,770
their concerns less able to share their

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,750
experiences and learn from each other so

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:56,480
actually the ability to talk about

00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,010
failure is very powerful for improving

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,630
team performance because it means you

00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,790
can actually have those open and honest

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,500
conversations and you can improve the

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:07,520
safety within the environment of the

00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,659
team and Google found that exactly the

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,739
same thing Google

00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:14,960
project Aristotle investigated with it

00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:19,369
across Google all of the different

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,080
factors that affected a team's overall

00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,799
performance they wanted to find what

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,019
were the things that really

00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,330
differentiate is the high-performing

00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:28,479
teams from the average performing teams

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,979
and they found the same thing it was

00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:32,659
team psychological safety that made a

00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:36,889
difference between the high performers

00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:37,789
and and everyone else so I have a

00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:40,909
hypothesis

00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:43,369
to share with you today Amy Edmondson

00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:45,769
studies and many other since of showing

00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:47,929
the psychological safety improves

00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:49,940
innovation within teams increases

00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:54,049
learning from mistakes and boosts

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:56,779
employee engagement we also knew no the

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:58,909
sre practices advocate for the

00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:01,849
acceptance of failure learning from

00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:06,440
failure measuring of failure so that we

00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:08,539
can make informed decisions so I want to

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,759
add an arrow in there I actually think

00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:12,859
that sre practices can transform teams

00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:19,249
by improving their psychological safety

00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:22,549
I want to talk about toil now does that

00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:27,700
even know what toilers there's a few

00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:30,109
people okay so defining toil toil is

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,229
work that doesn't add any long-term

00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:34,429
value and if you're in operations and

00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:36,409
you're sporting a platform there will be

00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:38,269
an amount of toil in your day job and

00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:41,749
it's to be expected it's things that are

00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:44,830
manual repeat repetitive automatable

00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:47,779
tactical they have no enduring value and

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,279
they grow in line with the size of the

00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:51,169
service that you're supporting I

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,479
actually spent a week shadowing the

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:55,940
cloud ops team at pivotal in Dublin and

00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:57,529
it was amazing to see how the word toil

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,970
had become part of their day-to-day

00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:03,559
vocabulary so you know when when we were

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,269
when they were completing tasks that

00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,210
felt repetitive that felt like they were

00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:09,470
they had no enduring value you'd hear

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,779
the phrase all this feels a bit too oily

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,710
oh I'm a bit too I might too good for

00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:17,299
this toilet

00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:19,190
and they'd and they and they put they

00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:20,539
put a story on the backlog to maybe have

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,779
a look at how those tasks could be

00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:27,379
automated and I've worked in teams where

00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:29,089
honestly the the toil the the manual

00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:32,239
work associated with keeping the lights

00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:34,249
on was not just someone's day job it was

00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:36,139
more than their day job I didn't have

00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:38,029
time to automate myself out of a job I

00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:39,679
didn't even have time to eat and that's

00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:41,269
how it feels for a lot of teams and

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,549
that's what happens when you leave toil

00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:44,629
unchecked because it will grow and it

00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:49,509
will grow and it will become your

00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:52,099
full-time job so sre advocates for

00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:54,200
setting a limit on the amount of toil

00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:55,669
that's acceptable in a team and they may

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,190
advocate for setting that at fifty

00:24:55,669 --> 00:25:00,080
percent so keeping your tour below fifty

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,419
percent will ensure that you have the

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,320
capacity with you within your team to

00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:08,359
engineer better solutions around

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,269
reliability but also automate some of

00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:13,519
the repeat repetitive non-value at work

00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:15,229
rather than throwing hundreds of people

00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,599
at a problem let's solve this problem

00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:21,710
with you know with software engineering

00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:26,349
with solutions but not all toil is equal

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:30,649
in my opinion and I really like this

00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:33,649
this quote from Joseph Bironas if we

00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:35,029
have two staff humans to do the work we

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:38,539
are feeding the machines with the blood

00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:40,129
sweat and tears of human beings if your

00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,080
system requires continuous human

00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:43,700
intervention to keep it up then you're

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,070
sacrificing the health and well-being of

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,889
your team for the availability of your

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,389
system and as I said before the impact

00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:53,570
on people's health and well-being can be

00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:55,700
can be significant you know these are

00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,450
these are not acceptable consequences of

00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:03,080
supporting your platform in production

00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:05,059
so I like to categorize toil we want to

00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,099
keep all toil below 50% but we really

00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:09,409
want to keep an eye on toxic toil this

00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:11,450
is the toil that hurts humans this is

00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:13,639
the stuff that wakes you up a night it

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,409
ruins your evenings and weekends it

00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:17,629
interrupts your work during your day job

00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:20,509
so you can't concentrate it distracts

00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:21,799
you and it stresses you out this is the

00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:24,379
stuff that needs to be prioritized

00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:26,179
because these are the things that will

00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:28,249
cause your team members to burnout to

00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:28,760
suffer from stress anxiety this is what

00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:30,500
we'll call

00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:37,760
people on your team to leave at the end

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:40,810
of the day we run a team meeting a

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,490
couple of months ago where we started to

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,530
where we wanted to look at whether or

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:50,150
not the needs of the team were being met

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:52,460
and it said that all models are lies but

00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:55,120
some are useful and I find Maslow's

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,620
hierarchy of needs to be a useful model

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,720
it's not perfect but it's useful in this

00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:03,050
context and Maslow's hierarchy of needs

00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,630
it talks about it talks about you know

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:07,850
the needs we have as humans so our basic

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:11,980
needs physiological needs we need food

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:14,840
we need we need water we need sleep

00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,460
once those needs are met we become more

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,220
concerned with our safety and our

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,290
security and when those B's needs a map

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,930
we look for we look for our social needs

00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:26,660
do I belong here am i part of a group

00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:29,750
and then and then really individual

00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:32,120
needs like actually how do I feel about

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:34,580
myself and am I the best version of

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,140
myself that I could be and we started

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,270
talking about actually what aspects of

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,450
our jobs impacted some of our life are

00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,590
some of our fundamental needs as humans

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,810
things like am I getting enough sleep

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:48,440
you know is my is my schedule

00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:51,410
sustainable am I am I afraid to fail or

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,410
do I feel safe to speak up when I don't

00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:56,900
know something do I spend enough time

00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:00,170
with my friends and family do I enjoy

00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,430
working with my co-workers do I feel

00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,830
like I'm good at my job

00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,630
do I have the opportunity to be good at

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,970
my job you know thinking about things

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,890
like toil is an incredibly frustrating

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,070
situation for a talented engineer to be

00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:15,290
in doing repetitive manual work when

00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,520
they could be doing so much more and one

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,620
of the most interesting things was the

00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,990
team identified the ability to continue

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,420
learning as one of the kind of top-tier

00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,860
needs like that that's what makes them

00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,720
feel that they're being the best version

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,620
of themselves this ability to continue

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,800
learning and to continue growing so this

00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:36,070
is my second hypothesis that sre

00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,960
practices can transform teams by meeting

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:41,030
employees needs both the physiological

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,440
needs actually are we looking at that

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,700
toxic toil there's

00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,230
making people up at night are we

00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,620
addressing that with engineering

00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:50,360
solutions do we feel safe to fail do we

00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,519
know that we'll be supported when when

00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:58,009
failure inevitably happens or will we be

00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:59,570
blamed you know do we have enough time

00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,950
to spend with our friends and family and

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,480
do we feel like we could be open and

00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:06,679
honest with our colleagues do we belong

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,659
here am I getting better at my job do I

00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:12,799
have the ability and the time to be good

00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:14,960
at my job and can I continue learning do

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,440
I have enough time in my day to try new

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,460
things into experiment so at the

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,500
beginning of this talk I asked the

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:25,490
question is sre good for you and

00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:27,799
obviously I think so but SRE

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,779
was only published in 2016 and there

00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,240
there are so many teams out there that

00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:34,970
are only just starting to experiment

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,549
with these concepts and so I want to

00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,990
hear from you on your sre journey I want

00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:41,179
to know how you're how you're

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:43,820
implementing your SLA s what difference

00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:46,370
your era budget mint meant to your team

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,320
how you went about building a blameless

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,389
culture from from where you are today

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,179
because I think over the next few years

00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:54,860
we're going to see a lot more teams

00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:57,379
become a lot more healthier as a result

00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,740
of these practices and I would love to

00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:03,769
share those stories thank you everybody

00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,690
for coming as Molly said I am going to

00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,190
be around all afternoon I will be

00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,470
hanging out outside this room and at

00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,759
lunch time to take some questions but I

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,820
really appreciate you coming thank you

00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:14,930
very much

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:18,170
[Applause]

00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:18,170
