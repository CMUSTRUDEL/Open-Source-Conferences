	Reliability Engineering for Humans - Hannah Foxwell, Pivotal

The concepts and practices of site reliability engineering are changing the way we build and operate our platforms and enabling us to have more meaningful conversations about availability, service-level objectives, and cost. But what are the benefits for the engineer holding the pager? Can we add a human element to our error budgets?

Join Hannah Foxwell to look at site reliability engineering practices through a human lens. Hannah combines SRE with HumanOps and explains how to use SRE practices to improve the health and well-being of your team.
