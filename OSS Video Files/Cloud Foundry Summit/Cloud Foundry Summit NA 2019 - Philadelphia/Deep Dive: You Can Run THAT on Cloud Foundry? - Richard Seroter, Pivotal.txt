	Deep Dive: You Can Run THAT on Cloud Foundry? - Richard Seroter, Pivotal

Do you think Cloud Foundry is just for cloud-native apps? It's an honest mistake to make. Cloud Foundry actually runs all sorts of workloads, many of which might surprise you. In this talk, join Richard as he walks through a handful of different types of applications—batch jobs, streaming pipelines, .NET apps, TCP routable apps, and more—and deploys each to Cloud Foundry. At the end of the talk, you'll walk away with a checklist of workloads that are suitable for a Cloud Foundry environment.
