Description: 
	How Cloud is Changing Open Source - Chris Power, Comcast

With the rapid adoption of cloud native technologies, open source business models and use has changed. Cloud changes how companies approach open source from a license, business model and business strategy perspective. I will speak about some of the changes I see in the business landscape and our own experience as a company that uses Cloud Foundry for applications.

awesome well thank you to to Greg and

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,279
Molly for for having me into the cloud

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,470
foundry foundation for the opportunity

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,630
and nithya as well nithya ruff who if

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:15,540
you were at the keynotes yesterday was

00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:17,039
also teed this talk up as well my name

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,109
is Chris Fowler I've been at Comcast

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,220
about about four years I work on the the

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,960
cloud team I'll talk a little bit about

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,199
that I wanted to spend a little time

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,210
today to talk about open source in the

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,219
in the cloud era if you will and give

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,440
you a bit of perspective from from where

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,910
I sit on the cloud side of things in

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,620
terms of how we sort of see open source

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,510
and how we see teams consuming open

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,100
source talk a little bit about some of

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,160
the challenges I think we're seeing in

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,520
in the open source space today and and

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,200
how that's reflected in the cloud so as

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,960
I said my name is Chris power I'm a

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,010
cloud or contect at Comcast I lead what

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,440
we call the cloud center of excellence

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,379
where we partner with a number of teams

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,750
across the organization not just Gregg's

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,449
but but our security organization data

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,760
center engineering and networking and a

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,770
number of other sre and tooling teams as

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,930
well to try to be an enabling function

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,909
for the organization as they transform

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,150
from you know this predominantly data

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,220
center centric environment into a very

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,540
cloud focused environment we'll talk a

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,310
little bit about some of the cloud stuff

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,920
that we've we've done but I think will

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,549
largely stay focused on some of the open

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,080
open-source bits yeah so that's sort of

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,820
what I view today historically at

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,350
Comcast I've built solutions in our

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,369
OpenStack environments and are in our

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,710
AWS environments as well so I guess

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,509
about eight or nine years ago there was

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,810
a somebody made the statement I think it

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,970
was Mark Andreasen that software is

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,310
eating the world and and it had probably

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,140
had been for some time but I think more

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,420
recently some folks have come out and

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,520
said open source is eating the software

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,619
which i think is largely the case right

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,299
if you take a look at the historical

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,619
software models they were largely built

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,049
around closed source proprietary

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,680
solutions and with the advent of open

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,619
source 20 30 even 40 years ago

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,679
you've seen that cannibalize that market

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,940
space where developers groups of

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,940
developers

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,200
commercial software providers as well

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,250
have gone on this bandwagon where

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,590
they've built open source that

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,840
essentially at least rival if not rivals

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,130
in some places displaces some cases

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,110
displaces some of their commercial

00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:29,160
solutions but I think what we're seeing

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:32,190
today is the the possibility that is

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,020
cloud now eating open source and I think

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,150
if you're if you're familiar with the

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,320
space and you use any of the sort of

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,930
public cloud vendors that are out there

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,470
today you'll see that what what I think

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,230
is happening is there's a strong demand

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,380
to consume deploy and run open source by

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,180
enterprises middle sort of middle market

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,790
companies and even and of course start

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,560
ups as well but a lot of the times

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,210
that's not necessarily their core

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,860
business right they're focused on

00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,870
building products and features and this

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,600
is true for us at Comcast and a lot of

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,370
cases and so what they want is to be

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,710
able to potentially consume those open

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,360
source products in some way so those

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,030
projects make them make their way into

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,520
into the cloud market space and we see

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,400
these cloud vendors running open source

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,260
software because there's a demand in the

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,030
marketplace for us for it and it's it's

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,200
causing I think some interesting

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,260
challenges that we'll talk a little bit

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,930
about give you a sense of the public

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,459
cloud market space it's growing as I

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,770
think is no surprise to anyone

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,330
ABS obviously dominates this space with

00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,310
somewhere between 31 and 34 percent

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,310
depending on who you talk to this I

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,430
think was from Canales and then Ashur is

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,620
growing incredibly rapidly in GCP as

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,750
well now as they've brought on some some

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,120
folks over from Oracle to run the cloud

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,950
business there what I think you see

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,870
there on the right is is actually

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,720
endemic of the industry but also true at

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,280
Comcast as well 84% of enterprises have

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,690
a multi cloud strategy so either some

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,620
form of multiple public clouds or

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,989
multiple private clouds we have both and

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,640
I think it's 58% are actually consuming

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,930
hybrid cloud in some way meaning to run

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,720
something on-premise and they're running

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,040
something in the cloud so a lot of these

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,330
open source solutions are really good to

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,580
do both of those things but in some

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,989
cases people that are moving to the

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,209
public lot are looking to consume these

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:22,160
services as I said as a service is not

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,160
as not as deployments of those things

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,440
and I think the markets just gonna

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,860
continue to grow gardeners looking at

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,080
almost 18 17 percent growth in 2019

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,960
across the worldwide public cloud

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,210
services footprint so I think this is

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,150
going to continue to just expand and we

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,800
see that playing out at Comcast as well

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,780
but open source is critical to the way

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,950
these cloud vendors behave and perform

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,270
if it wasn't for open source I don't

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,160
think very many of them would exist in

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,860
the way they do today

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,450
it started with Linux right the tip of

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,370
the red hats and the Canonical's of the

00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,140
world and other distributions but it

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,670
includes things like Xen and KVM as the

00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,320
hypervisors for all of the virtual

00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,320
machines that you'll find out there

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,300
running on these various cloud providers

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,850
solutions but if you look further you'll

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,730
find open source strewn throughout the

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:14,410
various things various services that

00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:17,740
they offer so elasticsearch Hadoop my

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,590
sequel Postgres things like Kafka

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,840
tensorflow kubernetes you name it it's

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,040
probably being offered as a service in

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,930
one form or another on one of these

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,000
clouds and all of these cloud vendors

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,600
have very different approaches to the

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,910
way that they're partnering with or a

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,370
plot or bringing open-source to market

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,200
so you if you look at Google they've

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,960
taken what most consider to be a sort of

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,090
open source first approach by trying to

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,140
put kubernetes out in the market and

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,669
things like that you look at Microsoft

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,370
they've become one of the biggest open

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:50,500
source contributors out there and with

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,479
the acquisition of github certainly are

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,160
firmly interested in that space and then

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,650
you look at Amazon who delivers a

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,479
majority of these open source products

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,130
as services and recently in the last

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,130
couple of years has also become a big

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,560
open source contributor arguably maybe

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,240
forcibly so but certainly have have

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,460
turned and started to play in that that

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,960
market as well what this is doing of

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,390
course is creating some interesting

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,370
challenges in this space for open source

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,370
especially for what people traditionally

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,660
refer to as these commercially

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,090
commercial open source software models

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,550
where you've got an open source project

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,320
that's being delivered commercially and

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:30,130
there's some interesting business pieces

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,539
that play there clearly though the open

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:35,650
source space is attracting a ton of

00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:36,139
investment just from 2010 to 2015 8 and

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,349
a half

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,900
growth you see a tremendous amount of

00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:45,020
investment in the CNC F ecosystem so

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,169
think kubernetes I think Prometheus sto

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:51,949
envoy etc blockchain obviously is a huge

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:53,300
investment space front in nodejs is one

00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:54,919
and and some of the stuff that that

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,330
you'll find over on the networking side

00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,030
as well so clearly there's a lot of

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,039
money pouring into open source both from

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,810
a venture capital perspective but also

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,669
from an investment on the on the cloud

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,580
provider side and this is further

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:09,979
reflected just last year alone this was

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,449
I think through the middle to end of

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,310
2010 but about the full time framer

00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,979
twenty of twenty eighteen sixty five

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:20,719
billion dollars pouring into into there

00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:22,460
versus in M&A IPOs and acquisitions

00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:25,159
it started with red-hot acquiring core s

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,159
in January and moved all the way through

00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:29,810
the end of the year with elastic having

00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:32,479
I think was about a five billion dollar

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,819
IPO in the middle there you've got pibil

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,439
obviously IP owed you've got sales

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,870
forces acquisition of mules off one of

00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,009
the bigger ones that we've seen

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,050
Microsoft's acquisition as we said of

00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:44,840
github but I think though you're seeing

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,520
here is that there's clearly a

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,590
tremendous amount of value in these

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,330
open-source products both from a

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,550
commercial perspective but also from a

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,930
consumption perspective I I think at

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,979
Comcast if I were to survey the

00:07:53,930 --> 00:08:00,889
footprint we probably would find 95 to

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:02,719
99 percent of the technologies listed

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:05,930
here in use in some way shape or form

00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:08,389
many of which were commercially engaged

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,099
with but at the very least more than

00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:12,319
likely not you'll find it in some open

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,819
source form as well we run our own

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,009
internal and github enterprise for

00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:19,180
example have had great success with that

00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:21,589
as well as some of the other things here

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,169
but what we've also seen are lots of

00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:25,940
huge acquisitions and consolidations so

00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,310
if you think about the the big data

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,830
space we saw a cloud era and Hortonworks

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,449
merged this year effectively they had

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,659
slightly different open source models

00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:38,029
Hortonworks was sort of more open open

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,039
source whereas cloud era was partially

00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:41,690
closed but they were both built on top

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,839
of the Hadoop ecosystem you saw the same

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,940
thing with in the community space where

00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,410
IBM we're acquiring hefty o for example

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,570
but the three biggest acquisitions

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,430
totaling some fifth almost fifty billion

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,320
dollars this year are obviously the

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,960
Salesforce mule soft Microsoft github

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,410
and more recently Red Hat acquiring IBM

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,630
and I think that makes 2018 the biggest

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,780
year and open source in terms of

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,100
acquisition in the last 20 years if I

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,280
were to say is I think three of the top

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,760
ten software acquisitions in the for

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:19,170
2018 in the past ten years were where

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,730
open source and occurred in 2018 so

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,920
clearly a lot of a lot of space here and

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,510
a lot of integrations and a developer

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,160
efficiency that have been born out of

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,300
this it's interesting to see where some

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,570
of these will go

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,760
I think the Microsoft acquiring github

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,610
one is certainly caused some

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,470
consternation in the in the industry I

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,900
personally think it will end up being a

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,280
good thing but I think time will tell

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:45,600
and the same thing probably for a Red

00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,920
Hat as well um so let's talk a little

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,480
bit about some of the current business

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,460
models and what we and some of the newer

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,500
ones that we see here is is not an

00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,640
exhaustive list I sort of in researching

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,400
some of the stuff for this talk came

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,140
across lots of different top five

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,390
business model lists and things like

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,820
that but I think this sums up majority

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:05,100
of them you've got the the subsidy angle

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,960
so corporate subsidies personal

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,550
subsidies meeting your an open source

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,410
developer you're writing code on your

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,870
own and contributing that we have

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,940
corporations that of course pay people

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,710
to build open source we do that as well

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,050
you've got donations based models

00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,610
corporate patronage grants and then the

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,080
more traditional models right so support

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,010
and services the Red Hat model if you

00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,310
will

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,500
distributions like you know Red Hat and

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,710
and you know pivotal and things like

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,910
that

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,260
and then the hosted or

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,690
software-as-a-service models that we've

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,730
been talking about where someone will

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,230
take open source and and then run that

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,520
and make that available or they'll have

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,350
a closed source model and make that

00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,270
available as well an example of that

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,970
might be something like data bricks for

00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:47,790
example which is a spark based vendor

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,950
and then the licensing models is just

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,570
where things I think get fairly

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,850
complicated so you've got open core

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,620
you've got the enterprise features that

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,120
get layered in on top of that and

00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,550
confluent is a really good example of

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,560
one of those what we traditionally known

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,779
as a commercial open source

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,689
software vendor there's a good list out

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:09,540
there if you google around for I think

00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:11,180
the top 100 open-source commercially

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,459
commercial open-source vendors by the

00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:18,540
open source software capital or group

00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,740
they keep a public Google Doc of that

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,389
which was really interesting to take a

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,519
look at but we're seeing is there's some

00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,649
new business models come into this space

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,939
here and what I think is really

00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:29,129
interesting is that you see this

00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:31,019
reflected in other industries as well so

00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:32,550
tide lifts isn't is an example of one of

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,819
these it's a subscription-based model

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,990
where you pay a subscription and your

00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:41,100
subscription goes to fund the creators

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,480
of the of the software and and and where

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,100
else have we seen this right so if you

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,559
think about the social media space think

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,759
about YouTube you've got maybe a hundred

00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,470
channels that have a million or more

00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,300
followers out there and those folks have

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,620
this tremendous amount of inertia behind

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,209
them and they're doing great for the

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,519
most part and then you've got this huge

00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:58,470
longtail of channels with very small

00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,629
following but people are grinding it out

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,220
there every day to build content some

00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:04,889
pretty amazing content and the same is

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,899
true for open source right so what have

00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,730
what has the social media space turn to

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:11,309
things like patreon subscription-based

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:15,209
hey you pay you get extra content access

00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:16,410
to content ahead of time ability to meet

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,939
the creator's things like that and I

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,439
think we're seeing solutions like tide

00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:20,639
lifts and other things that are sort of

00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,680
you know they're donation or

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,199
subscription-based mirroring that same

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,319
thing here which is this crowdfunded

00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,910
creator creation based economy really

00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:32,250
driving the limits of what we think of

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,899
as business models so I wanted to focus

00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,149
just for a minute on the on the open

00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,980
core model because that's I think really

00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:40,259
the foundation for a lot of what we're

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,399
seeing today so just maybe explain what

00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:46,199
what what it is and this was sort of new

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,269
to me and as a definition but I think

00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,500
it's it's probably familiar if you've if

00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:52,139
you've looked at the space at all right

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,610
so pulled this from Wikipedia but it's

00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,319
it's a business model that that helps

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,149
support the monetization of commercially

00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:59,550
produced software so typically there's a

00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:02,370
core open source project somewhere and

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,910
then packaged around that is some number

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:08,040
of layers of either open or source

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,189
available code or closed source

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,259
proprietary third-party code right and

00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:14,230
or some mix of that with some licensing

00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,430
in the mix and it gets fair

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,080
complicated and we'll talk about a

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,180
couple of examples but generally

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,490
speaking this is is the core definition

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,800
of it and most commercial open source

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,170
software companies are using some form

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,970
of this model today and and I think most

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,310
have been largely successful right we

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,140
just went through the 65 billion odd

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,630
dollars of money that's flowed into that

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,700
space in the last sort of 12 months and

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:40,000
many of those are traditional commercial

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,430
open source software companies but what

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,540
but what we're seeing is that as the

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,220
cloud vendors come into the space and

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,630
start delivering these solutions as

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,280
services they're challenging the

00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,920
business models of these commercial open

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,080
source companies directly

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,690
so what we're then seeing is we're

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,210
seeing new licenses come into play

00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:00,790
licenses that are shocking some

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:02,530
complicating other the space I think the

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,660
first foray in this space was Commons

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,050
clause which was intended to take open

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,310
source and make it essentially

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,930
protective against the cloud vendors

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,480
from deploying their software as

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,520
services in a commercial sense to try to

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,220
create space for these commercial

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:22,150
vendors who support the open source

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,350
projects mostly directly right to to be

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,120
able to make some money because at the

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,830
end of the day open sources is not free

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,900
somebody is paying for it somehow way

00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:32,500
through time or money some notable

00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:35,740
examples in 2018 where DB Redis

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,960
elastic confluent as we mentioned what

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,270
we saw was we saw reactions from these

00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,150
companies to the open source vendors

00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,130
either historically running services

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,230
like elastic search for example or more

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,690
recently Kafka for example as a service

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,880
and reactions to that in the form of

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,010
these vendors going and changing their

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,240
commercial licenses to expressly

00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:00,190
prohibit in most cases the the offering

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,220
of their these open-source projects as

00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,900
services via the cloud and and they're

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,540
doing this in a protective sense whether

00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,800
this is going to to sort of work or not

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,890
as a good question I think this presents

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,880
a lot of challenges for the space

00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,110
there's been a tremendous amount of

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,240
pushback from the open source community

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,040
as they've introduced these new licenses

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,420
understandably because generally

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,730
speaking they're not open source open

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,980
source is not just here's the code open

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,360
sources here's the code and here's rules

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,770
around how you can distribute the code

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,640
and that's where these licenses really

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,820
change

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,740
the game they add complexity they make

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,190
it complicated for enterprises like

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,060
Comcast to figure out how to go about

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,740
packaging that software and delivering

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,840
it in most cases these licenses are not

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:45,340
targeting you and I in that form but the

00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,560
question then is do they actually solve

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,030
the problem because some common cause

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,100
has been in effect for a while and other

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,510
sort of a GPL and other types of

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,400
licenses have been in fact for a long

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,400
time and these vendors are still out

00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,070
there doing this these cloud vendors but

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,870
they're reacting to market demand right

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,520
the vendors see a demand in the market

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,310
and they run this these open source

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,290
projects as a result of that so the

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,270
question then is are they enforceable

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,270
and I think we get to we've yet to

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:15,340
really see that and then it makes it and

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,220
typically harder I think to combine

00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,410
these models these open source hybrid

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,370
models with other open source projects

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,890
because then you get in these

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,720
overlapping license situations which I

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,870
think for especially for large

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:34,300
organizations like ourselves complicates

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:35,950
things quite quite a bit so I'm going to

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,710
talk about I think a couple of specific

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,060
examples just to really look at this in

00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,740
a concrete fashion because this was

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,840
helpful for me to really understand this

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,940
so confluent and elastic we'll just

00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:50,200
maybe touch on those from a commercial

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:52,000
perspective confluent offers a you know

00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,320
is built around as an open core project

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,120
right it's built around an open source

00:16:53,320 --> 00:17:01,060
distribution apache Kafka license under

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,770
Apache 2.0 they offer it as a platform

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,600
you can download in the upper right

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,190
there as well as via confluent cloud

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,230
which is essentially a managed service

00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,910
that they provide which so happens to

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,270
run on most of the public cloud vendor

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,880
solutions but what we saw recently I

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,640
think towards the end of last year was

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,970
the release of managed kafka in Amazon

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,170
as an example and and confluent reacting

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,670
to that with the introduction of the

00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,130
confluent community license which is

00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,050
this tweener license that sits in

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,840
between traditional open source Apache

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,640
2.0 Kafka and the confluent Enterprise

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,900
license which provides some

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,330
enterprise-grade features which is a

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,920
commonly sort of accepted model I'm you

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,580
know it's one that that pivotal uses

00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,769
it's one that read you know other

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,690
tribution is use with the injection of

00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:47,929
this in between that covers some of

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:50,149
their I'm gonna call them value-added

00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:52,940
proprietary features things like their

00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:55,149
case equal the schema registry which is

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,640
super important in stream data platforms

00:17:55,149 --> 00:18:01,970
and essentially all this license does is

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:05,419
expressly prohibit the use of the of

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:07,730
these features for by cloud vendors when

00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:10,100
offering a managed streaming platform

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:13,610
right so they are very much this is very

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:16,789
much targeted at that specific attack

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,919
vector if you will but it certainly

00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:21,679
complicates things some of these vendors

00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,769
actually provide this middle tier of

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,779
source code as source available as part

00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:28,909
of their distributions and others do not

00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:30,860
so a lot of the times when you pull this

00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:32,419
down you may get both the piece on the

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,880
left and the piece in the middle or not

00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:36,110
and some of that stuff and that makes it

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,250
I think complicated for us when we're

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,309
trying to figure out how do we consume

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,830
this and how do we legally deploy these

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:45,230
software within our organizations and

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,110
honestly the same can be largely said of

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,210
elasticsearch they finally decided that

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,340
they would take their X pack which was

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,260
their sort of proprietary feature around

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,139
that they deliver it on top of the

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,450
elastic core and actually roll that into

00:18:57,139 --> 00:19:01,039
their open source distribution as code

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,870
available features that are free

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,210
generally speaking outside of their

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,950
specific enterprise features and so they

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,380
have a similar model their code is

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,269
actually open code available in there so

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,000
it does make it a bit complicated and

00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:16,519
then what we saw as a direct result of

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,519
sort of some of these things which was

00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:21,529
we saw Amazon then saying okay well you

00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,360
know we're going to release what we call

00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:26,860
open distro for elasticsearch which is

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:30,110
essentially a fork of the elasticsearch

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,659
codebase that they then partnered with I

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:35,269
believe Expedia and Netflix to start

00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:39,019
distributing which essentially offers

00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:41,990
under Apache 2.0 license all of the

00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:44,330
features that are covered by the by that

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,760
tweener elastic license that that

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,710
essentially says you can't use these

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,230
features as a cloud vendor to deploy

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,029
these things that stuff has been

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,650
developed majority of it at least and

00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:58,250
then pushed out through Apache

00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,050
oh via the open distro for elasticsearch

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,930
so we've clearly got a clashing of

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:07,490
business models and licensing here that

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:09,020
I think this was just March 11th so

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,780
we're talking less than a few weeks ago

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,430
right so this is really early stage not

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,510
sure where this is gonna play out but I

00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,070
think it's really interesting to see

00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,300
these two things and it's unfortunate in

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,940
some respects because now we've got

00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,920
essentially Forked repositories and this

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,880
is what I think is is the challenge with

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:28,550
some of these hybrid license models so

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,380
what can we do I think Abby said it

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:33,559
yesterday engage more in open source

00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:36,250
engage in the community write code bug

00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,450
fixes documentation feedback issues

00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,220
community engagement in the form of all

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:45,070
of us sitting here today supporting our

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:47,720
foundations meetups going to conferences

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:50,380
and financial support right as

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,580
supporters of foundations or as

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,860
organizations that are paying developers

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,679
to build code there's a myriad ways that

00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,990
we can as a community can can help move

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,290
this forward it won't necessarily solve

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,670
this murky hybrid license problem but

00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,700
the more that we're engaged and

00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:09,320
understand and are intelligent consumers

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,900
of open-source the more we can be

00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,340
involved in the debate and work with the

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,290
cloud vendors and work with the open

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,450
source distributions and work with the

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,970
commercial open source solutions -

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,100
really / - get to it so some sort of

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,780
tenable situation because ultimately

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,540
what we're trying to foster here is a

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,390
sustainable technology space where

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,040
people can make money off of software

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,470
and businesses can run and build amazing

00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,720
products and and today that's a lot a

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,790
lot of that is based on open source so

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,410
just to talk a little bit about what

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,600
we're doing at Comcast for a few minutes

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,790
I don't think we have the answers or all

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,770
of the solutions and we certainly could

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,210
be doing more but I think we are doing a

00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,980
lot isn't if you mentioned yesterday at

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,240
the keynotes and just wanted to cover

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,830
that a little bit so for the benefit of

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,660
the folks in the room Comcast is a mere

00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,220
a bunch of different brands so Xfinity

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,760
is one that folks are well known that's

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:04,940
TV Internet home security mobile now and

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,820
voice traditional landline and we are

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,370
also own NBC and Universal Studio so

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,490
brands like

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:14,430
nbcnbc all of those film and television

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:18,450
networks Telemundo Fandango I believe as

00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:20,760
well and the Universal Studios studios

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,040
as well as the theme parks and as of I

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,720
guess it was maybe six months ago we

00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:29,280
also sky is also part of our corporate

00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,400
umbrella if you will so that would be

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:37,559
the equivalent of Comcast and the cable

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,450
pieces in in the UK as well so well

00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:41,070
you'll find those you'll find the use of

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,830
cloud as well as the use of open source

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,570
throughout all of these brands as is

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,400
probably no surprise so let's talk just

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:51,929
a quick minute about our open source

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:54,870
journey because I think it is it is sort

00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:58,800
of emblematic of our commitment to to

00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,720
this space go all the way back to 2006

00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,210
we started consuming open source which

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,610
is I think where most people start and

00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,929
that's natural at some point a few years

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,670
later we decided to start contributing

00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,800
and they the contributions came out

00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,050
slowly a little bits here and there

00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,070
where we were using things we got

00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:17,130
involved with the Apache Software

00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:19,320
Foundation in 2011 and we started

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,740
launching open source projects on the

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,890
public github comm under the Comcast

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,970
organization in 2012 so if you go there

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,000
today and we'll talk a little bit about

00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,559
that you'll find quite a few projects

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,059
we've been supporters of other various

00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,850
foundations that we'll talk about I

00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:37,410
think really the the sort of watershed

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,540
moment for the organization has really

00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,910
come in the last two or three years with

00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:45,210
the with the advent of our open source

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:46,590
practice office who I seen nithya is the

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,020
head of is sitting in the audience here

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:51,120
today as well as an amazing team of

00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:54,270
people a number of which I see also in

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,070
the room who really are a center of

00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,230
excellence and a knowledge base that we

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,170
as a large engineering organization can

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,790
go and speak to and understand what are

00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,380
the right open source licenses and

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,480
practices that we should be looking at

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,580
and they work with various parts of the

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,220
organization and foundations and our

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,480
legal group to really enable us as an

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,150
engineering organization to build

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,710
products and be really thoughtful about

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,860
how we do that with respect to open

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,860
source

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,650
and then I think you know most recently

00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,000
we've gotten involved in the cloud

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,040
native computing foundation we've been

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,470
involved in the cloud foundry foundation

00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,120
for as well and OpenStack has also been

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:35,410
an area where we've been significant

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,030
contributors in the past so specifically

00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,160
from a community engagement perspective

00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,660
we're involved kind of across the board

00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,059
and lots of things this was just some

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,190
highlights I've personally been involved

00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:47,320
in the stuff on the left specifically

00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,540
OpenStack and cloud native computing

00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,150
foundation you will find deployments of

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,770
all of the software here within Comcast

00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,870
in various forms as well as

00:24:53,770 --> 00:25:00,010
contributions coming from Comcast

00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:01,240
of comm casters some of which are done

00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,410
as part of their normal course of

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,880
business some of which are done through

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,740
our open source fellowship program where

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,640
we're actually sponsoring people to

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,190
spend time contributing back in addition

00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,900
we're strong supporters financially of

00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,510
these open source foundations

00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,820
specifically a lot of the ones that you

00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,049
that you see here I'm most familiar with

00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,299
sort of what the ones on the left there

00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:24,220
where we're engaged at kind of a number

00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:25,809
of different levels so I think they're

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,790
said there's a really strong commitment

00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,290
from from our organization to try to be

00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,450
involved to be out there be talking to

00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:34,120
people hearing challenges and trying to

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,950
deliver you know our challenges and and

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,790
some of our needs back into this these

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:41,559
organizations if you're sitting seeing

00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,750
some of the projects you can head over

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:46,270
to Comcast github IO

00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,370
I just highlighted and picked a few of

00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,540
the most recent contributions that we've

00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,510
made these are projects that we've

00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:54,160
open-sourced ourselves and and have

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,200
gotten I think quite a bit of traction

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,480
the canonical example for us is Apache

00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,250
traffic control down on the bottom left

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,140
there which is a traffic server for our

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,400
content delivery network and that's been

00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,870
something we've open sourced and has

00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,549
been open source for some number of

00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:09,580
years now more recently though in the

00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:12,429
last 12 months the top three there so

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,110
trickster which is a open source project

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:16,690
that plays in the CN CF space quite a

00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,190
bit it's a front in cash for Prometheus

00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:21,730
so if you've ever used Prometheus which

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:23,380
is a metrics solution it can it's

00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,330
generally a good performer but where it

00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,550
starts to slow down sometimes is from a

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,690
from a query perspective and so

00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,890
trickster is sort of a cache that can

00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,929
sit in front of that as well as sit in

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,290
front of other backends also about

00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:35,540
something internally developed in

00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:37,130
source kübra health is another one which

00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,610
is a health checking system for

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,010
kubernetes

00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,780
and vinyl dns is one of our internal DNS

00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,160
management solutions so these are all

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,270
projects that we have built and then

00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,590
there's of course contributions that

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:50,570
we're making to kubernetes and other

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:52,280
solutions ourselves as well so lastly

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,020
you know where are we going from here

00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,550
right what's the future of open source

00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,350
and these business models I don't have

00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,150
all the answers I sought to sort of

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,070
hopefully educate everybody today and

00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,890
myself selfishly as well through this

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,630
process I think the the flow of money

00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,640
into the open source space is driving a

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,230
tremendous amount of change and the

00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,850
demand from the market the demand from

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:16,040
organizations like Comcast right to to

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,930
consume open source either directly and

00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,310
run it ourselves or via cloud providers

00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,170
in which we do a lot of ourselves as

00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,460
well and that's forcing the models and

00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,130
the licenses that I've worked over the

00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,990
last sort of 25 years you know it's a

00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,670
change in the future so you know how

00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,900
where's it gonna go how do we predict

00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,820
that I don't I don't know that I have

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,170
all the answers but hopefully you walk

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,980
away with understanding a bit more about

00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:39,470
the space and and and as certainly I did

00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:46,089
as well thanks

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:46,089
[Applause]

00:27:53,010 --> 00:28:02,970
I saw you first friendly this was not

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:05,400
play a two-question no it wasn't nice so

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:08,370
from a monetization standpoint sure so

00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,490
as we go forward how much do you see it

00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:15,419
the the trend or at least the model

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:17,250
where its micro changes or necessarily

00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:20,660
paying individual contributors as

00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:23,730
opposed to company sponsorship in ways

00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,110
do an almost like a gig economy kind of

00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,120
thing do you think that's gonna become

00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,890
more prevalent as we go forward that

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,740
there's more individual contributors who

00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:35,130
are on a pay to submit kind of basis

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,570
yeah I think we've seen that and and I

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,000
think solutions like tide lifts are

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,400
probably a way to sort of like scale up

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,419
that model a little bit we see this a

00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,010
lot with some of these open source

00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,140
projects that are kind of in the middle

00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:49,590
of this space I think where you have the

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:51,179
potentially the creators form a you know

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,130
a little a little consulting shop right

00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,440
around that open source project and are

00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,990
willing to do specific feature

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,610
development for paying customers right

00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,440
well that where there can fundamentally

00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,299
alter the the roadmap if they believe it

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,130
it's sort of the right place and I think

00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:06,600
that's an area where where we can see

00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,049
some expanded expansion in the future

00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,049
yeah

00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:19,420
as you look at these platforms at

00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:21,670
Comcast you know you're gonna use these

00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,920
for some pretty big scale and you start

00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:25,570
to put some chips on a platform with the

00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,330
different licensing models of

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:30,550
open-source and their support and you

00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:32,170
know add-on features etc how do you make

00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,360
a decision on your team if you're gonna

00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,070
pay for that support or if you think you

00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,960
can support it yourself internally or

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:40,570
use a partner how do you figure out that

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,190
cost side forecast yeah that's a really

00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,440
good question I think the financial

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,230
model here right how to how to support

00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,910
this is is a complex one we I think

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,980
generally use a fairly distributed

00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,140
decision-making model on the whole

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,910
meaning it's up to most of the

00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,640
engineering teams largely to decide

00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,050
what's best for them and how to fund and

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,410
make the business case to pay for these

00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:06,190
things I think what we see is that a lot

00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:09,400
of our teams elect to contribute in some

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,840
way to the support models for some of

00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,820
these open source projects either

00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,950
because they're looking for support in a

00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,870
material way and want to have a backstop

00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,750
for themselves or because they're

00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:21,370
looking for the some additional

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,560
enterprise features and that might drive

00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,060
them down that path as well but I myself

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,420
have certainly run a number of open

00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,280
source prod products directly myself and

00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,810
supported them I think on the whole that

00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,000
makes sense that's some some of the

00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,820
small to medium scales as things become

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,760
more critical to the enterprise we often

00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:42,010
look at least initially to to the

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,240
vendors in the space to help but as we

00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,500
develop centers of excellence around

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,580
these things Cloud Foundry is a great

00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,820
example of that we have a tremendous

00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,530
team and a huge community of Engineers

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,510
that derive a tremendous amount of

00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,130
benefit from that we can sort of bring

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,930
some of that expertise and develop some

00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,580
of that expertise in-house which enables

00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:59,380
us to you know be a little bit more

00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,430
flexible with choosing whether or not to

00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:05,260
consume that but I think we have

00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:07,900
probably both of those scenarios hello

00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,450
just I saw your timeline it was pretty

00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:14,260
extensive history of using open source

00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:16,510
can you share what successes or

00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,390
challenges you've faced in maintaining

00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:21,520
executive support throughout that time

00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,560
period because what we see is that you

00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,299
know you get a ball rolling maybe a

00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,789
leadership changes

00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:29,470
and projects are abandoned and support

00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:31,809
for them both externally and internally

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,580
so how did you maintain the support over

00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:37,330
that period of time yeah that's a good

00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,669
question probably a longer answer but

00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:41,860
I'll give you the sort of my perspective

00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:43,149
as a consumer and contributor internally

00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,820
we've got sort of this inner source

00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:48,539
model that we support and as well we've

00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,409
contributed externally as well I think

00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,909
generally speaking the leadership from

00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,769
day one has been supportive obviously

00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:55,409
that that ebbs and flows and we're so

00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:59,379
we're fortunate in that respect I think

00:31:55,409 --> 00:32:01,059
and and and to the extent that we put

00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:03,519
our money where our mouth is mouths are

00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:06,249
if you will in a creation of this open

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,940
source practice office that's really

00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:12,940
helped to create a sustainable

00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:16,330
I guess model if you will internally for

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:19,359
for the advocating for open source but

00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:21,940
making it easy to have a well paved road

00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,159
to both consume open source but also

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,230
contribute I think historically where we

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,700
saw a lot of challenge was it was myrrh

00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,950
it was very unclear how to go about

00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,299
contributing and many people didn't

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,549
spend too much time understanding how to

00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:34,869
consume and as a result though in the

00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:37,649
last three or four years I think we've

00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:40,690
seen a much much more sustainable model

00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:43,989
or built around that because of this

00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:45,249
knowledge in the space it's actually all

00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:47,259
the time we have for questions I'm sure

00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:48,580
you take some afterwards yeah grab Chris

00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:54,950
after thank you thank you

00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:54,950
