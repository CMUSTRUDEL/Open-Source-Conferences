Description: 
	Cloud Foundry for Everyone! - Mirna Alaisami & Matthias Haeussler, Novatec Consulting GmbH

This talk will give an overview of the various possibilities to easily access and get in touch with the Cloud Foundry platform. Cloud Foundry comes in various flavors, there is a big range of commercial hosted offerings, private deployment options and various development environment alternatives. This presentation is intended for users who would like to get their first hands-on experience or for others who might want to evaluate an alternative deployment option. The analysis will compare the public offerings based on the metrics of price, availability, options and available services as well as the self-deployed options in terms of simplicity in setup and handling and requirements. It is supposed to cover the breadth of the Cloud Foundry offerings and give an easy entry path to the technology. Kubernetes-based offerings like CFCR, containerized CF and Project Eirini will be covered as well.

right so I'm gonna start it then hello

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,170
first of all and thank you all for

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,240
coming to to the talk Cloud Foundry for

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,000
everyone

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,070
this talk will hopefully it's intended

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,070
to help people getting started with the

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,939
with the Cloud Foundry platform and

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,980
technology and as you can see from the

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,349
title right here there are two names on

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,859
the list and as you can see on the

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:35,780
photos here - there's my colleague Myrna

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,780
and the other one that's me

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,040
unfortunately you can see that I'm

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,250
standing here on my own and this has a

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,320
bit of a sad reason actually what we

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,920
submitted that the talk worked on a talk

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,379
both together and got accepted

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,329
unfortunately after that Mona did get

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,649
there her visa declined and she was not

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,760
allowed to enter the United States and

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:05,990
that's something I don't I don't find

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,280
really good but there is technology and

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,799
technology can be better than those

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,720
stupid immigration rules and with that

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,479
technology we're actually able to bring

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,990
Myrna in so there is Munna

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:26,130
where you can say hi and wait for that

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:37,229
and I say again please we can hear you

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:38,490
now okay okay okay so we had we didn't

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,509
know in the beginning if this is gonna

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,110
work or not

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,630
so I gotta do most of the presentation

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,280
during that talk and later on we have a

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,810
few steps of a live demo and that's

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,549
basically where I tried to do some

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,970
screen sharing with Mona and that she

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,579
can do her her part then so I'm happy

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,939
that that that this works and then

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,700
switch over to the three agenda so as

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,040
this is the one-on-one Trek I figured a

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,869
situation for people being very new to

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,970
Cloud Foundry and an interest in

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,849
California so we try to summarize a

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,530
couple of things which might weigh might

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,170
make your life easier too

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,780
get started so by the time you leave

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,640
that room again I would like that

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,430
everybody has a bit of an idea where can

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,770
you get generic information and help

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,569
about Cloud Foundry I give you a bit of

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,370
an insight on the basics of the

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,230
technology basically a couple of

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,390
fundamental things that I just think you

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,090
should understand a bit of an insight on

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,700
the command line interface I will also

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,489
talk about the lovely Cloud Foundry

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,530
community where I'm a proud member of

00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:45,570
how they can help you getting things

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,620
started or getting to learn things

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,910
better and become a real master in that

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,970
the majority of the talk will basically

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,739
be to get a bit of an overview about the

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,410
various Cloud Foundry options

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,180
so basically when you're new new to it

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,920
and then where you can you start how

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,830
would you get your like first deployment

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:10,050
experience and so on and also a bit of a

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:14,040
look out into the future so the way I

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:17,610
started this i'm besides my consultant

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,769
job at at nova tech and being and

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,799
running the cloud foundry meet up in the

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,780
area of stuttgart I'm also teaching

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,690
cloud native software development at a

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,780
university there and I had two students

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,130
hired and I basically gave them I knew

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,959
that they were new to micro service

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,519
development container technology and

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,890
cloud foundry and things like company

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,570
does in particular so I just sent them

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,780
out with the idea and said please find

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,959
out for me what is cloud foundry and how

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,820
can you access cloud foundry and the

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,000
points they came back with about like

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,859
two weeks or so and cellphone was an

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,829
open source pass cloud computing system

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:58,590
it's fast easy build test deploy and

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:00,120
scale applications support in the

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,010
language runtimes multiple different

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,299
service bionics and so on so most of

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,500
those things we have probably already

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,600
seen it they found a very good video

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,579
recording from Dale's deaf news and from

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,859
a former CF summit which said they

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,690
provide a lot of help and help them

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:17,160
getting started as well and then there

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,410
was the point that may be particularly

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,209
happy is when they said we were able to

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,909
push our first application to fill the

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,590
web services like the first couple of

00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:26,820
bullets I kind of expect that the last

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,530
one I didn't really

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,480
showed me that even without any guidance

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,030
from my side they were able to get there

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,340
and so with this talk I will probably

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,130
just try to recap a couple of the steps

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:42,210
that they did and then continue on to

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:45,150
that survey so the two way to get to get

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,650
started and get information you probably

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,080
all know that Cloud Foundry has a home

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,850
page it's not funny but org on that home

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,770
page there is a direct link to a getting

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,560
started section there you can either

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:58,170
find information or basically say I'm

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,710
ready to try and get started with with

00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,060
this doing some deployments now I'm not

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,060
gonna walk to the home to the home page

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,120
I mean that's not the content of this of

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,690
this talk so do you feel a bit of a

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,170
visual idea of my understanding of Cloud

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,390
Foundry

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,210
it's like if you've a very simplified

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:21,210
view it's just like kind of a black box

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,250
right sorry black box right there and we

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,020
have basically two groups of people

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,900
interacting with it there's developers

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,250
and there's consumers in the end in a

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,500
simplified way the developer would push

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,030
your application to the cloud to the

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,090
cloud foundry platform that will return

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,590
a URL and that is the consumer that's

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,630
something that the consumers can use to

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,540
access that if we look a little bit

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,300
further under the cover and I'm not

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,640
gonna go technically deeper than that

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,340
Cloud Foundry has a model internally

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,400
which is very strongly oriented at the

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,990
12 factor app guidelines and splits the

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,690
components basically into the categories

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,260
applications and services applications

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,790
is the part where the developer deploys

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,340
this is where the magic command see if

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,750
push comes in so the only thing the

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,750
developer has to provide us a piece of

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,290
code that will push the application into

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,850
the runtime internally a so called

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,860
droplet will be builds this is a

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,410
combination of an applic of the

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,360
application codes and the the runtime

00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,980
for that this runtime is being called

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,440
build pack so I think you've heard about

00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,170
build packs this morning in the keynote

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,180
this is exactly where this comes in now

00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,070
if that applications if they have like

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,600
connections to only connections to

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,980
something like a messaging service or a

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,200
database or anything any legacy

00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,050
application this is the service side of

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,659
of Cloud Foundry and the command to

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,330
like to bind our services as the name

00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:47,159
already implies UCF pine service which

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,050
will then attach those back-end services

00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,669
to your application and you don't need

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,030
to worry about like the individual

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:56,370
connection settings and so on so this is

00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:00,150
something and then as I said before a

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,789
route or a URL will be like provided by

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,610
the platform for the for the application

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,470
logic to be consumed this is basically

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,840
the fundamental understanding that I

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,289
would expect everybody to have to move

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,940
forward with this then there is this

00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:17,520
Cloud Foundry command-line interface

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,830
this is like a generic API that you can

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,550
use across all the various Cloud Foundry

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,409
environments I've made a like I try to

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,330
symbolize that that we have like

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:29,039
potentially local Cloud Foundry

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,150
installations like for developer

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,789
environment like I have on my machine

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,349
then there are public options or you can

00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:35,969
run the Cloud Foundry installation in

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,310
some larger data centers no matter where

00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:40,860
you run it the CLI will always be the

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,479
same and as always does just a basic set

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,120
of commands like pushing an application

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,710
scaling lifting the options for the

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,020
services in the marketplace and then

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:53,250
trade and binding them so it's it's

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,710
pretty easy okay a few words about the

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,190
community and I can see a few community

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:02,849
members sitting here and smiling we are

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:04,560
here to help especially the people on

00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:08,099
the left bottom is the so called Cloud

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,569
Foundry ambassadors we are here to get

00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,729
people started and getting people in

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,409
touch with the platform there is an open

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,389
slack Channel the code is on github

00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:18,029
their mailing lists and so on we also

00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,759
have a Twitter account there should be

00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,110
plenty of things to to find out

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,300
information in case you have any

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,310
questions if you have any questions

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,110
right after this talk you look up the

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,169
two people in front of me or talk to me

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,449
we'll be happy to to answer that at

00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:36,750
least we're gonna try I'm gonna try it

00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:38,339
they know what's better than me now on

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,130
there is also some free training

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,899
material available if you go on the

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,880
website you will find trainings guides

00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,529
tutorials certifications the one I'm

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,300
recommending here is the so called Cloud

00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,850
Foundry for beginners from your zero to

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,550
hero it's self-paced training class it's

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,990
free and

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,880
you should spend a bit of time on that

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,640
but after after doing this class you're

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,500
pretty very well set to to operate this

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,140
from from a developer perspective a

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:10,300
couple of people from the community have

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:12,590
also created individual tutorials

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,050
learning materials so there's the soak

00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,990
CF push Club it's like a one-page kind

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:21,230
of instruction how to deploy

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,210
applications to pivotal web services

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,070
this was done by Molly Crowder I've

00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,690
talked to her the other day she said she

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,950
might actually expand that and to show

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,670
how things can be done on different

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:34,130
platforms - then there is the Tri Cloud

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,320
Foundry website which Steve Greenberg

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:40,190
the gentleman here in the front has just

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,870
set up he basically started this in the

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,810
same time as we try to prepare for the

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:48,470
talk so this came in very handy for us

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:51,080
so I'm just gonna open it real quick for

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,680
you and I really recommend everybody to

00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,140
try that

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,250
so in here if you walk through that you

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,350
should basically get a similar

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,580
experience and what I try to bring

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:03,380
across with my with my with my talk here

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,570
so it will list the requirements that

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,820
you need to install then you can pick a

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,130
provider here the list of the providers

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,810
to get started with then install the CLI

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,160
and do all the things so I'm not gonna

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,810
walk through all of this but I can

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,880
definitely recommend checking this out

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:22,010
this is a really cool thing so other

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,570
than that you will find plenty of things

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,240
the third example that I brought up is

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,980
the cloud foundry hello worlds so this

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,840
is a free good hub repository where you

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,580
can find different hello world

00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,200
applications written in the various

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,060
languages that cloud foundry supports

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,580
and if you want to play with some of

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:42,080
them just like pull the code and and

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:45,560
push them to the platform okay so so

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,480
much for the basics and an introduction

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,850
things so now when you say you're ready

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,400
at the point I want to play with the

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,280
platform now and I want to and I want to

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,780
use it what kind of options do I have

00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,390
this was basically the task that I gave

00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,770
to the student to evaluate after they

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,640
had done the initial the initial

00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:06,389
learning curve so basically as I saw in

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,610
the picture before you have like

00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:10,110
options and in a local way where you can

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,939
think run things on your machine you

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,699
have public provider options and you

00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:17,759
have hosted options now if you're

00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:19,559
getting just started the hosted option

00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,819
is probably not the right one to start

00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,129
with because that means like a

00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:24,480
large-scale installation and if you're

00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,279
not just going to play a little with it

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,929
in order to get familiar with that I

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:32,040
would recommend to start with either the

00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:35,429
local or the public options so the local

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,489
options they're basically three there is

00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:41,970
the so-called PCF dev this is like a

00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:43,799
single node Cloud Foundry instance it

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,660
has the full functional scope from a

00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,129
development perspective not so much from

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,389
an operator perspective because it's

00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:50,549
just a single node so there's no

00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:55,170
failover on the on the infrastructure

00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:58,259
side but basically you can use it as a

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:01,259
full PCF it has a basic amount of

00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:04,230
services for database messaging caching

00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:07,259
and it's free you only need to register

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:10,139
at pivotal to to pull that there is a

00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,759
similar version of this from based on

00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,220
the open source version of Cloud Foundry

00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,459
this is called the CF def this runs

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,139
currently only on Mac OS and Windows 10

00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:20,459
this is also free doesn't require any

00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,759
registration and you can pull it

00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:26,850
directly from github the third option is

00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,350
the so called CF local option this

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,049
however is not a real Cloud Foundry

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,720
runtime so but you will find that in the

00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:35,309
local options so it runs the droplet

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,290
spacing the pieces that you build in

00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:38,790
containers and it's in my opinion that's

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,980
more suitable for local testing and

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,779
debugging so if you really want to get

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,639
started with the CF push experience on

00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:47,009
an on your local machine I would

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,449
probably start with PCF Def and see if

00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:53,459
they're first now looking more at the

00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:55,769
public options you can see there is a

00:12:53,459 --> 00:13:00,149
list of certified providers on that web

00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:03,209
page now most of them also provide a

00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:05,160
public offering or a free trial offering

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:07,379
for everybody that wants to get started

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,019
not all of them I mean the one that I

00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:12,689
have highlighted is other ones that I'm

00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:15,480
not gonna do like a magnet be able to

00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:17,490
show in depth today basically Atos is

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,589
currently changing their trial offering

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,190
and it's undergoing a change so we were

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:23,089
not able to

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:25,800
to test this at the time cloud golf is

00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:26,850
it's available only for I think

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,490
governmental and educational

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,870
institutions in the u.s. that kind of

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,259
made it a bit difficult for us to test

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:37,439
and souza is more it doesn't have a

00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:40,019
public provided cloud in in in the same

00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:42,600
way as the others would have they are

00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,160
more focusing on integration cloud

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,560
funding with kubernetes and rolling that

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,819
out in your local data center they're

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,980
working on that I've talked about them

00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:53,040
yesterday but there's nothing I can I

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,740
can tell you about that yet so we must

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,750
mostly focus on PWRs IBM cloud Swiss

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,050
command s ap in addition to that we also

00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:03,389
took any nines into the play they offer

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:07,920
a really easy to consume service and and

00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:11,879
which is very suitable for trying so PWS

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,189
in the first place this was also the one

00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:18,420
that my students discovered as the first

00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:20,879
one to test this has probably the the

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,009
biggest market adoption but I'm not sure

00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,019
about that but basically the feedback

00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:27,300
that I got from them is it's very easy

00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,490
and straightforward to use so it was

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,350
even for beginners really simple to get

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,389
to get their applications deployed and

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,220
and and the service instantiate it I

00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,019
mean the reason why I did this

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,089
experiment with the students was just

00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,329
like if I know if I had pulled this

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:43,800
together my focus would on my few point

00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:45,540
would already be very biased because I

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,680
got that background experience in

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,850
particularly I wanted to have somebody

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:54,209
which is really new for that so when the

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:56,430
the flavor that PWS basically provides

00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:59,220
is like it's cut it's very pretty much

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,660
focused on micro service development so

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,610
you got your banking services like

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,490
databases messaging caching and

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,290
streaming and explicit support for like

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,000
spring and spring good application like

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:14,670
a circuit break or conflict serve or

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,709
registry s ap is also the the common

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,779
that I got this was the smoothest user

00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:20,519
experience I don't know exactly how that

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:24,170
differs from very user friendly but I

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,970
guess both of them are really nice so

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,519
from a from a from a from from that

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,199
level that it was a similar positive

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,910
experience they have a standard set of

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,520
build pack the differentiator here is

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,370
they have

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,110
like some offerings for Hana watch or

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:41,020
they're machine learning called Leonardo

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:44,500
so this is basically how how it works in

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:47,110
general all those three tiers offered a

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,230
kind of a standard set and each

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,120
different company has kind of their own

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:56,110
back-end services for the for the users

00:15:52,120 --> 00:16:00,000
to consume in particular IBM IBM has far

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:03,490
the largest set of services available

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,440
there are things for IOT e is bent in

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,860
the what's inside artificial

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,200
intelligence machine learning and so on

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,980
this IBM Cloud Foundry also comes in two

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,840
options

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,970
there's the global Cloud Foundry

00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,040
platform which was initially known as s

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,260
bluemix and there's the so called Cloud

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,460
Foundry Enterprise Edition in that case

00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,280
you're going to get your own dedicated

00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,440
cluster of Cloud Foundry nodes however

00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,420
the second option is probably not the

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,850
right one for you to start so the

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,940
feedback that I got from my students at

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,460
that point was they got everything

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,700
running but it wasn't as intuitive as

00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:42,820
the others most likely the reason is

00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,970
this is only one subset of the overall

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,040
IBM cloud offering and they had very

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,040
some various CLI tools like the Cloud

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,620
Foundry then the bluemix or an IV IBM

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,300
cloud and they got a little bit confused

00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,590
but that initially in the end when they

00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,240
had worked through that they got their

00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:02,830
thing running and the user experience

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:06,190
was just the same any nines has a really

00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,690
fast registration process and the thing

00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,790
we know that there is even in the

00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:12,940
registration page and in the invitation

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:16,270
email you get your CF push instructions

00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:19,060
straight away so this is pretty much the

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,400
fastest application to platform

00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,600
experience that we had also very easy

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:28,330
and very user friendly Swisscom is

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,340
another alternative based in based in

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:33,250
Europe the the kind of difference that

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,980
we found out here they have this free

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,680
tier only available for individuals in

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,270
Switzerland the other other people would

00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,250
require some kind of company

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,760
registration too but still getting the

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,140
free tier then so as I was able to sign

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,780
up there without any problem

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,230
after that after registration seems very

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,260
easy

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:56,110
good good friendly documentation and

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,480
very positive experience here as well as

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:02,140
I guess that before Sousa is basically

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,030
listed as a certified provider working

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,780
very much to running their containers in

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,049
kubernetes

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,480
everything is open-source but no real

00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:13,420
public cloud that we could that we would

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,240
be able to show it show right here so

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,730
this is a bit of an overview by which

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,040
means they they differentiate I mean

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,620
some most of them are the trial

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,730
offerings are scoped by a duration so

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:30,490
the pivotal sa P and Swiss come over 90

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,860
days any nines over 30 the the big

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,919
exception here is IBM this is a trial

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,710
offering that basically never expires on

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,230
the other side IBM offers the least

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,330
amount of volume so it's like you can

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,580
run very small services over a longer

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,500
period of time but you cannot do bigger

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,020
things like in the other trial versions

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,299
s IP was the clear winner here with four

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,840
gigabytes of RAM all the others have one

00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,419
and two

00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,350
except Swisscom has you have like a

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:02,470
monthly volume given in Swiss francs and

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:06,429
you can deploy as much as it until it

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:08,710
comes to to that to that limit Bill pegs

00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:10,660
are mostly the same as I said before

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,450
there is a standard set of billed peg

00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,400
that pretty much everybody has and each

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,160
provider has maybe one or the other

00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,070
certain build packs specified to a tool

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:25,360
the certain needs in IBM you for example

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:27,250
get a IBM Liberty build pack as a

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,840
standard offering for the other ones you

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,299
would have to take this from from a

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,100
community build peg resource so there's

00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:34,270
not much difference there where there is

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,549
a lot of difference you can really see

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:42,309
that in the services iBM is leading that

00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:43,630
by far and this is also quite a quite a

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:48,520
challenge to understand what they all do

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:50,080
but a lot of them are there and and the

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,970
other ones are ruffian Innes in a scope

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,240
of like 10 20 services which you can

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:58,900
consume for that trial offering ok so

00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,220
now we'll try to demo this a little bit

00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:05,560
and

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:06,990
for that I want to see if Munna is still

00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,299
here

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,299
[Music]

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,420
so you're still there I'm gonna switch

00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:20,950
this on can you say something quickly

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:24,880
because we can heed you my scream yes

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:28,060
okay well I'm gonna yeah you can share

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:32,280
your screen in the in the zoo meeting

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,280
now let's see if that works

00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:44,700
yes can you see anything it no can you

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:44,700
increase your font by any chance

00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:56,650
it's a decide okay we changed the

00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:04,180
lighting runner it's still okay a little

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:07,870
small I know it's not working okay I

00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:12,700
mean I think it should be okay like that

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:14,740
I mean in the end we're just gonna push

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,660
an application right we take the same

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:22,270
application and push it to a couple of

00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:23,920
clouds and so once you show it from the

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,720
front don't want to show the web page

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,030
that should be fine

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,010
so I would say just just go ahead with

00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:33,330
with doing that we have about like an

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:36,190
eight minutes left that should be okay

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,230
so you can talk about initially we

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,680
didn't think we have an audio CK and but

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:45,460
now you can you can speak to the people

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:47,890
so if you hear me II will I will try to

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,790
use a Swiss command any Niles as

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:55,020
providers here and since I'm already

00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:57,550
looked into Swiss come to save some time

00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:01,320
will show the services available there

00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,320
using the CF marketplace come up

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:12,370
so we can see a couple of them here we

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,650
can see the service name what are the

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:18,160
plans that are available there and here

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:21,640
it's important just see to say that some

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,040
revisers offer only specific plans for

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,290
trail accounts so you have to be aware

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:31,150
of that and you can see the description

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:35,860
and so on you can also see which built

00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:45,250
bags are there you forgot to be I think

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:48,640
yeah exactly and here we can see also a

00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:54,010
set of built bags that's what some offer

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:57,190
and I'm gonna say that we have already

00:22:54,010 --> 00:23:00,070
pushed application to Swisscom we have

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:03,070
bound it to a database service and has

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,020
killed it into two instances I'm not

00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:08,080
going to show these steps for that right

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:13,000
now but it's already there I can show

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:15,309
that with the CF apps command so we have

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,070
our simple web application in the

00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:20,070
started state with two instances there

00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:26,799
with the CF services command we can see

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:31,720
that we have a database service which is

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:34,480
bound to our application and right now

00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,390
I'm going to switch to any nines as a

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,950
provider I do you want to show this

00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,110
running in the browser first or you want

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,880
to but maybe that's a good idea

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:48,130
change the provider do the push and then

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,510
show the browser okay so this is space

00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,950
as a background this is basically what

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,410
we pretty much did with all the various

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,120
providers basically figure out how many

00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:58,260
how many services do they offer

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,270
how many billed pegs are available and

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,549
what Mona said is important to repeat I

00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:05,830
mean you might see all the services but

00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:08,260
not all of the services come for in a

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:12,000
free trial version so most of the

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:15,700
databases or messaging providers have a

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,880
as a small kind of test service which is

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,710
which is free as a trial but the

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,000
advanced versions will most likely cost

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,280
something than which is also kind of

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,290
understandable but estimate I said

00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,050
especially if you have already I mean

00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,730
put on your credit card account be

00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,770
careful with creating that services I

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,320
remember I tried a rabbit in queue

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:38,080
instance once and I suddenly had $300 on

00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,650
my credit card without any further

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,140
notification this this can happen so

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:48,970
make sure you look at at the other trial

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:55,300
versions there okay so I can minute you

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:58,150
can know yeah I've looked into any nines

00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:05,830
right now I will show these services

00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:08,110
available there again so we can see a

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:15,270
different set of services compared to a

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:15,270
swisco and regarding the build bugs

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:26,570
we can see also a list of bill banks

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:29,450
here and here I'm gonna show the steps

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:31,970
of pushing the application with the CF

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,960
Bush command and it's important to

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:37,040
mention here that you are not going to

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,200
determine some attributes like

00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,510
application name or number of instances

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,330
the memory limit and so on since we've

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:47,390
already created a manifest file where we

00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:50,180
already determined all of that so we're

00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:55,130
just going to execute the CF push

00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:57,650
command we can see that it just

00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:02,000
automatically detects this manifest file

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:04,370
and they takes the attributes from there

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,820
like the application name the number of

00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:12,559
instances the memory limits and so on ok

00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,940
so you can maybe start showing the

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,179
browser for the Swisscom so we have like

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,160
three or four minutes to go and I mean

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,960
the idea that we had for this demo was

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,570
just basically use the same application

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,120
and I'm about to show the same steps on

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,340
like pivotal Web Services and s AP and

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,090
just to see that it's basically the

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:34,250
consistent behavior across the board and

00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:40,940
so you stop screen sharing right yeah I

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:44,080
will share it in my browser okay so can

00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:49,460
you see it right now yes we can see that

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:52,700
okay so this is the application on a

00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:55,910
swisco we can see the provider name with

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,670
the epic lightning point here and here's

00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:02,120
the application instance index and since

00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:05,450
we already scaled our application into

00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:08,179
two instances there with the refresh we

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:13,300
can see that the application instance

00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:13,300
index will change between 0 and 1 so

00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,679
that's sorry execute a cloud foundry

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,240
load balancing mechanism and a quick

00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,760
word about that application another

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,010
thanks to Steve this is the basic source

00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,830
code we got is that Steve uses for his

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,270
Cloud Foundry trainings here at the at

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,340
the Cloud Foundry summit that you can

00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,120
can also take we just extended it a

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,340
little

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,200
basically identify the provider name and

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,210
display it there as well

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,670
so you can see which cloud we're

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,500
basically connected to so when Mona will

00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:47,870
just like basically points to the

00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:50,720
application deployed on what did I want

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:59,420
to say any lines then this program

00:27:50,720 --> 00:28:01,880
should should look different yes in the

00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,390
meantime I can start doing new things on

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,880
my own so I have the same source code

00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:13,730
installed here currently I am locked in

00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:16,100
to basically my local environment so men

00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:18,380
are basically showed it on to push the

00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:21,290
application to to public cloud providers

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,540
I'm having a local PCF deaf running

00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:27,740
right here so as you can see the

00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:30,200
behavior is exactly the same it's it's a

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,700
full full version of Cloud Foundry you

00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,860
don't you don't need the network access

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,570
in the same way so this is something you

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:39,800
can easily try if you want to do that

00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:40,940
locally but maybe we I just finished a

00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:47,000
presentation and we're gonna have a look

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:49,850
at that then so for the future to today

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,340
you have seen Jules talking in the

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,780
keynote about Irene II and I think I'm

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,970
really looking forward for this product

00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,490
project to mature same as with the Cloud

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,670
Foundry containerization because right

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:03,020
now there are many kubernetes options

00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,700
easily available and if we have

00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,830
something to just like black cloud

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:10,670
foundry into that that will open up a

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:14,140
new range of options for people to get

00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:16,760
in touch with Cloud Foundry easily and

00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:19,190
yeah besides the things we said before

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,100
we also have their companies dedicated

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:24,710
to work on Cloud Foundry you find most

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,260
of them at the at the foundry with a

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,420
sponsor booth there are companies once

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,550
you are beyond the level of doing your

00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,780
initial CF push she wants you won't want

00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,550
to use it in production and wanna get

00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,500
help so these are the ones that I have

00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,210
already a personal experience with and I

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,670
can definitely recommend so I'm not

00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,470
going to read through all of those but

00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:44,360
this presentation is recorded you can

00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,770
definitely look them up later or or ask

00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,560
me I can deaf

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:50,810
the link to all of them and finally I

00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,370
just want to say thank you very much to

00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:55,040
him and she and Reed sue those were the

00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,960
two students that helped me and Myrna

00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,720
doing all the survey and again to Steve

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,230
this time covered in a with sunglasses

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,520
but it's the gentleman right here this

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:14,030
is I got it

00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:16,040
my time is up so we can basically see

00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:20,630
here now I should be able to see you

00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:24,310
know that this application has started

00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:28,300
so if I open this up in my browser

00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,300
basically open a new browser window

00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:33,830
should yeah it's just a little leak so

00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,630
you can see here the provider name has

00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:37,820
changed in that instance now this is

00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:40,100
pointing to my to my local environment

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,330
I have only one in the instance running

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,430
and it's connected to only to an

00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,460
in-memory database but as you can see

00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,450
it's it's very easy to do that and no

00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,770
matter which cloud you are you're

00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,990
pointing to it's always going to behave

00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:56,030
in the same way so Myrna do you have

00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:59,390
ways okay like we can see your screen

00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:01,910
again now and this is the pretty much

00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:05,630
just the same thing on her browser for

00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:07,190
that other account on any nines and with

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,860
that we're basically at the end of what

00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:13,310
we wanted to show and I think I run a

00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:19,670
little bit over so are there any

00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:21,910
questions right now we can take yes

00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,910
please

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:46,690
mm-hmm right okay so the question was

00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:49,300
what kind of an if I got it correctly

00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:51,280
what kind of an impact do I have when I

00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,340
look at services when I switch the cloud

00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,360
provider as basically the application

00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,220
side there's nothing you were really

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,559
gonna worry about because that's that's

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:03,840
being backed by the better build packs I

00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:08,670
mean the answer is of course it depends

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:12,809
if you use some service which is really

00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:15,220
very only available at one very provider

00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:16,900
you will most likely not find it at the

00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,390
other one and then you have like a major

00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:22,450
migration effort if you have something

00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,760
like for example post press SQL as a

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,520
database back-end which most of the

00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,650
providers have a service for then it

00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,270
will be easier to migrate data from one

00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,280
provider to the other I mean this is the

00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:37,750
typical vendor login kind of problem

00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:40,559
problem that you have there so in case

00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:43,690
you don't need a certain specific

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,640
functionality I would try to stick to

00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:49,210
something which is available in a

00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:51,070
broader way but I mean if you use IBM

00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:53,080
cloud for example because you want to

00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,660
consume some kind of their Watson

00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,270
services or whatsoever then this is the

00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:01,179
reason why I need that cloud if you want

00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:02,710
to swap switch to another one then you

00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,000
will want we won't find a service there

00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,070
I mean maybe you can connect to a

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,309
network to consume only the service and

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:11,020
run your application in another provider

00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:11,830
that would potentially work but it's

00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,270
nothing that you would say

00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,920
out-of-the-box I mean it just can't move

00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,090
like the services around because they're

00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:26,460
like a part of your trial and

00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:26,460
reinstallation right

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,860
Christian maybe we can take this

00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,620
discussion outside because I already

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,179
consider next speaker and I always hate

00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,550
it if I own if you don't have enough

00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:38,540
time to prep rate so first of all thanks

00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,340
for listening and coming

00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,900
thanks for Munna for staying up all

00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,940
night because it's very late in Germany

00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,389
now I'm glad you could participate a

00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:50,749
little bit and that's it thanks a lot

00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:50,749
