Description: 
	Deep Dive: Cracks in the Foundation: Operating Cloud Foundry in the Real World - Stephanie Mathis, Technology Manager & Josh Ghiloni, Pivotal

There are dozens of talks from various conferences over the years that talk about how successful Cloud Foundry has made their business. Nobody seems to talk, however, about all the bumps in the road they hit on the way to that success. Stephanie has seen her fair share of bumps as a Technology Manager at a major insurance company as they deploy massive foundations, and in his role as a Solutions Architect with Pivotal, Josh has seen common and uncommon problems that plague customers from all industry verticals. In this talk, they will present their top 10 biggest problems they (and maybe you too!) have encountered, and how they can be avoided, mitigated, or solved altogether.

About Stephanie Mathis
Stephanie is a Technology Manager. She started out as a software developer and most recently took on the role of Product Manager for the Cloud Foundry Platform team. She’s seen many sides of the development world, being a developer herself, helping teams adopt continuous delivery and agile methodologies and now leading the team that’s standing up one of the insurance industry's largest cloud platforms. Stephanie has spoken at various industry meetups and presented at local universities.

About Josh Ghiloni
Josh has been with Pivotal as an Advisory Solutions Architect since 2017 but has been using Cloud Foundry since 2014. He is a member of the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Solutions team, where he has helped customers over every industry vertical be successful running Cloud Foundry in production at scale.

all right everybody welcome welcome

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,640
thanks for coming right after lunch he

had a lot of choices for some really

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,990
really good talks at the timeslot you

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,639
had a choice to sit down and take a nap

00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,059
and you chose us and I really appreciate

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,100
that

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,490
please don't nap in here right so thank

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,840
you

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,119
cracks in the foundation we're going to

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,449
talk about bumps in the road that you're

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,910
gonna see during your time running Cloud

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,359
Foundry and getting started and all of

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,859
those things so to kick us off I have a

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,690
disclosure I'm going to share with you

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,180
so just so you know everything that I

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,370
say today are my own thoughts my own

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,590
opinions and in no way you reflect any

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,440
of the views values or opinions of my

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,360
employer everybody got that we may

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,250
remind you just a few times we might

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,260
bear with us on that yeah

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,610
so first I wanted to give a little bit

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,399
of a background as to why we wanted to

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,820
give this talk so how many show of hands

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,160
have been to conferences in the past

00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,750
yeah this is good how many have walked

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,750
out of a conference and maybe been like

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,970
wow that was great I know I felt like

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,880
rainbows poppies butterflies

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,650
everything's great but then you reflect

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,720
on your own experience you're like wait

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,760
a minute I was talking about how great

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,000
this was but I'm not having that same

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,130
experience am i doing something wrong

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,869
the answer is no we didn't have barely

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,490
anyone talking about it so that's what

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,159
we wanted to share with you today some

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,840
of the things that might go wrong and we

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,299
used to mitigate that we used to look

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,100
into it differently and to share it

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,360
because we're all a community and we

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,130
should talk about the things that go

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,520
wrong so that we can share and grow from

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,409
each other that's right and we want you

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,119
to know that we know some of you are

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,189
going through this right now and that's

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,399
okay and we're here with you and you

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,240
know everybody has been through this and

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,610
normally when you see an introduction

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,229
slide like this this is where we explain

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:57,899
who we are and what we do but our BIOS

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:01,740
exists there on the schedule and you're

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,530
more than welcome to read them and this

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,750
is a ten list it's not a top ten list

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,989
it's not a not top ten list if you're an

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,030
ESPN fan it's just a ten list it's ten

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,470
things that we came up with in no

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,090
particular order

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,650
that reason is to keep you on your toes

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,270
you don't even know what the top one

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,640
might be so bear with us as we go

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,220
through the whole list so for number ten

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,400
to kick us off automation is the

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,370
solution to our problems but it's also

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,630
the problem sometimes how many engineers

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,270
out there and this is gonna be a little

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,720
show of courage have over-engineered a

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,600
solution oh this is good oh this is this

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,740
is a safe space I like this I know I

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,630
have right we've created the perfect

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,030
code we think it's gorgeous it's

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,760
beautiful then someone else takes a look

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,340
at it can't read it at all having a

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,800
really hard time following it right and

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,090
that's the idea is you don't want to

00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,459
write automation that does absolutely

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,990
everything you could possibly think of

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,520
and then some and you'll never have to

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,970
update it for 25 years

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,480
no you want to do what it's supposed to

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,060
do right right exactly at pivotal we

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,910
preach iterative development iterative

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,830
deployment we want you to deploy early

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,630
we want you to deploy so early that

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,500
first time that you're uncomfortable

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,570
deploying really uncomfortable deploying

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,910
we want you to deploy often multiple

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,950
times a day if you have to every time

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,980
you push to your source control system

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,200
you should trigger a deploy and that can

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,239
go for application teams and platform

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,160
development teams right everybody should

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,060
be a little uncomfortable those first

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,530
couple of times you're pushing things

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,420
out you're gonna have users you're gonna

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,540
get feedback and that's the idea right

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,360
perfect is the enemy of good exactly can

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,830
we think of any other areas in the world

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,870
where this is applicable that's really

00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,440
okay so everyone pull out your painters

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,420
hats

00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,799
think about some artists that you may

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,269
know and I'm gonna highlight two of them

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,160
by the way I hope you brought lots of

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,400
hats we're going to be wearing lots of

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,040
hats today the first ones Michaelangelo

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,019
anybody heard of Michelangelo nothing

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,160
into turtle okay we're not we're not as

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,280
courageous about reason our hand about

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,350
here yeah okay so Michelangelo pretty

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,930
pretty famous right painting the Sistine

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,040
Chapel and Josh do you happen to know

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,630
how long it took him to paint the

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,789
Sistine Chapel I do know because we've

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,530
practiced this talked a bunch and it was

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,960
like four years

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,520
was about four years that's a long time

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,080
right if you think about it

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,570
meaning not a long time in terms of

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,730
creating the perfect painting but

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,410
perfect is the enemy of good at the end

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,720
of the day if you boil it down to what

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,610
it is it's a painting I want you to

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,040
think about another artist what are you

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,210
think about Bob Ross haven't seen Bob

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,919
Ross do some paintings

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,830
oh there's more hands this is good all

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,080
right so Bob Ross in about 30 minutes

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,810
create a pretty good painting right I

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,940
know I've been impressed and he creates

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,830
maybe little happy accidents along the

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,080
way and that's okay because at the end

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,480
of the day he has a painting and now I'm

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,520
great and Michelangelo pretty famous

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,800
Sistine Chapel is gorgeous it's

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,750
beautiful but they're both paintings and

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,520
that's the idea here at the end of the

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,010
day you want to get something done you

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,360
want to get a painting finished right

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,419
let's take this back a little bit to the

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,830
tech world and let's pretend that I'm

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,660
the Michelangelo here I have been

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,669
working on a piece of automation on my

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,370
system it's sitting on my laptop it's

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:29,820
beautiful it's got hundreds or thousands

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:33,090
of unit tests it's covering every

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:38,430
possible situation I can think of but

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:44,430
it's not in prod yes you do you need a

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:46,710
curler or a perm I guess you have a

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,410
piece of automation that you are

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:53,100
constantly deploying to your prod CI

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,500
system or CD system and maybe it's 70%

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,510
of the way there maybe it doesn't do

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,120
everything yet maybe there's some bugs

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,740
she's getting real feedback she's

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,450
getting feedback from customers because

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,180
I don't care how many hundreds or

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:09,240
thousands of unit tests you have your

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,090
customers will find a way to break it in

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,460
a way you didn't think of it's very much

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:19,140
a case of if it ain't broke I can fix

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:21,240
that philosophy you don't want to build

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,860
the Ferrari out the door you want to

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,090
start with this skateboard give it to

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,010
your customers let them try it out a

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,200
little bit realize they want the bike

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,640
and then you can stop at the bike and

00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,710
iterate on that maybe get some flashy

00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,750
features on your bike you don't have to

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,250
wait before you deliver something get

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,580
out to your customers as fast as you can

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,010
right so Josh

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,230
to kind of switch gears a little bit how

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,750
do you expect the unexpected

00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:47,300
you can't why is that because it's in

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,570
the name if you expect the unexpected

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,510
it's now the expected it's kind of kind

00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:57,290
of a definition right exactly it's just

00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,180
kind of how it works so but you often

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,700
get asked that and you get asked that by

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,560
maybe upper management maybe your

00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,050
colleagues maybe you're asking yourself

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:11,050
that and a lot of times that's because

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:14,240
there is fear fear of failure fear of

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,550
letting someone down be it your boss or

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,140
your co-workers or even yourself how

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,230
many here have ever dealt with a

00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,870
situation where you thought if you fail

00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:26,090
you're gonna face punishment I'm gonna

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,030
use that word I'm gonna use that word

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,500
very generically but maybe it's you know

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,960
you don't you're not a lot of touch

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,520
product for a week or you know you have

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,020
to bring in bagels because you broke the

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,220
build and you're like I don't want to

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,810
put anything out into protein work

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,790
because I just did something terrible

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:50,120
so you have a lot of very confident

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:52,670
people here we've all been there and

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,940
that's the idea right so let's picture

00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:59,230
this what would happen if in say an

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:02,600
entire production foundation went down

00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:04,580
and and and really really down let's say

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,900
someone accidentally deleted a VP see

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,540
that your Cloud Foundry systems running

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,700
in anybody really uncomfortable right

00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,770
now yeah but everybody want to check

00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,430
your pagers if anybody's holding the

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,840
pager so what we're saying here is you

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,870
know you've got to give some thought

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,250
into that you're going to have failures

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,950
it's actually like the one thing you can

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:29,150
expect things are going to go wrong its

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:30,560
death taxes and outages yeah you've got

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,210
to think about failure and you've got to

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,380
think about disaster recovery so we're

00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,150
not saying don't think about those

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,760
things don't plan for them but we're

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,560
saying you can play in more for how

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,680
you're gonna handle failure how you're

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,470
gonna handle when those things happen if

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,540
it's not it's not if right it's when

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,209
anybody's taking down production before

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,920
show hands

00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:56,570
if you haven't you will probably look

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,279
and that's okay here's the thing you're

00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,630
gonna learn from that we learn from our

00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,370
mistakes and again that's the whole

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,680
point of this you won't get it a hundred

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,050
percent right the first time either take

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,550
a minute reflect on what happened these

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,800
are some of the best learning scenarios

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,360
you're ever going to encounter reflect

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,699
on that and say hey maybe that

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,050
automation that I put out before maybe I

00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:17,089
can add something to that

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,160
to make it better check for this the

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,589
next time iterate on my development

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:28,040
right so if you can't expect the

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:29,860
unexpected what should we do I think I

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,560
think we should plan for the unexpected

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,209
like that like that exactly yeah

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,100
absolutely you can plan for the

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,139
unexpected and you can learn from the

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,240
unexpected you know when you have a

00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:43,910
failure when you have an outage do a

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:48,470
post-mortem and make it blameless

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:53,329
anybody do post-mortems yeah how many of

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:56,360
you focus on what happened and why all

00:09:53,329 --> 00:10:00,699
right now how many just that guy how

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,190
many of you focus on who did it yeah

00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:06,350
maybe maybe maybe you shouldn't do that

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,959
you know it doesn't matter who did it it

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:11,060
matters what happened how you fixed it

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,899
and how you are going to mitigate it in

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,630
the future

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:15,649
I love post-mortems because it's a

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,690
chance to actually share with your

00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:19,550
consumers hey we know something happened

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,319
and we want to be transparent about it

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,779
we want to tell you what we learned from

00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:25,940
that scenario but one pitfall that you

00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:27,800
might run into you did you just share

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,420
the bad things gotta make sure you

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,010
balance that share out the good things

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,839
that are happening - what are those

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,730
success stories what are those gee-whiz

00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,860
numbers get people really comfortable

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,930
with sharing information both bad and

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,760
good and how you're learning through the

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,189
process because it can also encourage

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,959
others to do the same thing then you

00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:47,000
really get into that community aspect

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,130
and learning from each other right and

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,930
you can also post-mortem your teams and

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,079
I know that sounds morbid so we actually

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:58,029
use a different term we call them retros

00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,029
how many here do team retros weekly

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:02,260
quarterly

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,450
hopefully a little more frequently than

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,790
that but the point is you sit down with

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,140
your team gauge the health of your team

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,330
just like you gauge the health of your

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,760
platform find out what's been going well

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:17,230
find out what's not been going well and

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,870
figure out how to change that so that

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,640
the things that aren't going well aren't

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:28,600
not going well the next time you do a

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:29,380
retro anyone not doing oh this is good

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,209
we're getting we're getting some

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,950
courageous people out there that's okay

00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:35,500
right because this is a learning

00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,720
opportunity you can be the change in

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,579
your company to say hey why don't we

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,440
share out what we did to fix this

00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:43,269
problem why don't we share out the

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,550
things that maybe went wrong and learn

00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,870
from other people it's your chance to

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,970
stand up whether you're a formal leader

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,130
an informal leader and developer and

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,750
operator it doesn't matter you can say

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,490
hey failure we're going to learn from

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,839
that we're gonna do things differently

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,130
next time and we're gonna share all the

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,339
things that matter right and I'm gonna

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:04,089
do a bit of a disclosure here that we

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:06,490
know this is not easy this massive shift

00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:09,730
in cultural change is not easy we're not

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,649
claiming it's easy we don't want it to

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,149
sound like it's easy because then we'd

00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:17,470
be just Becht all the talks that we

00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,850
didn't like before we know it's hard we

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,270
know it's gonna take a while and we're

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,100
gonna hammer on that as we continue on

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:27,220
so for this next one how do you change

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,680
the culture around upgrades this is kind

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,000
of our second culture why so how many

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,930
out there and your hands are gonna get

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,880
tired because we're gonna do a lot of

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,709
this raising hands thing so how many out

00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,930
there maybe have maintenance windows

00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:39,700
anyone been around at midnight on a

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,709
Saturday midnight on a Sunday putting

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,199
out a change excited for that breakfast

00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:45,279
pizza that's coming at 7:00 a.m. might

00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:47,230
just be a Midwestern thing I'm not sure

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,820
but it's it's a breakfast PTA if you

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,050
have it at breakfast time there you go

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,600
that's a great way to think about it

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,220
what happens anyone else maybe have an

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,470
expectation you have a hundred percent

00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,610
uptime outside of those designated

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:02,829
maintenance windows yeah how great is

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,050
that you've been on the consumer side of

00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:07,750
that have you ever tried to go to a page

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:11,020
maybe update your car registration or

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,980
possibly make a dining reservation you

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,010
see a page it says

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,480
oh this page is under maintenance anyone

00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,630
had that experience before I just had

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,350
this yesterday yeah how did that make

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:25,480
you feel oh I like this great one over

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:29,050
here I felt great glad I couldn't update

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,630
my car registration is perfect now I

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,340
want you to think about really that

00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,080
experience and how you could change some

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:38,380
of that right because if you think about

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,000
it if you want 100% uptime while you

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,130
have that hundred percent uptime you're

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,200
running on static infrastructure static

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,940
infrastructure doesn't get updated you

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,800
have zero day threats just sitting out

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,570
there waiting to be exploited maybe

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,580
somebody's already exploited your system

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,410
and you don't know it and they're just

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:59,050
sitting there doing their nefarious

00:13:53,410 --> 00:14:00,340
deeds with you none the wiser and so you

00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,080
really need to get into those small

00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,010
incremental upgrades because it will

00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,600
mitigate those threats and the idea here

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,310
isn't that you're just pushing code

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,410
willy-nilly out to production every day

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,960
right the idea is that you're looking at

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,400
proper testing practices scans you've

00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,530
got continuous delivery in place

00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,210
continuous integration on both sides the

00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,430
application delivery side and your

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,380
platform side so that you know when a

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,150
piece of code is going out it's been

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,100
through that testing lifecycle it's been

00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,050
through those scans I have confidence in

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,200
that now is it perfect

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:34,480
no of course that you're always going to

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,860
run right right and we don't want it to

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,930
be perfect because perfect the enemy of

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:43,120
good that's right you're learning

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:45,790
oh yeah I'm learning about is how many

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:57,760
people are at their best at midnight on

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:59,470
a Saturday for work so yeah probably not

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,350
even anyone a little bit better at 9:00

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,270
a.m. on a Tuesday probably in better

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,190
shape around there yeah some people are

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,440
our night oh yeah hopefully you've had a

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,790
couple of coffees by then yeah here's

00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,410
here's the thing to think about though

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,390
when it comes to upgrades when it comes

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,680
to patches we've got to start getting

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,660
comfortable with some of those things

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,180
happening behind the scenes and trying

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,460
to introduce changes and

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,710
that aren't going to impact our users

00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,810
it's important to think about that but

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,090
to be comfortable with it because you

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:30,630
only have one person on midnight on a

00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:32,130
Saturday and something goes wrong yeah

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,360
it's not great right there probably have

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,440
to call the other ten people who weren't

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,970
awake and they're not out there best

00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,910
either and these have a whole bunch of

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,890
people at about 60% maybe give or take

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:44,250
but if you're giving that upgrade at

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:46,200
9:00 a.m. on a Tuesday perhaps maybe you

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,270
have people closer to 100% you've got

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,700
your team there and they're focused if

00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,680
something were to go wrong right and

00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,900
going back to the zero day threatened

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,540
you know I don't think many companies

00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,060
will just let known zero days sit on

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:03,120
their platform you address that you

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:05,820
deploy a fix for that zero day but when

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,550
you do that you are acknowledging and

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,920
accepting risk so why not extend that a

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,990
little bit further why not check your

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,810
error budgets because you should have

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,750
error budgets you should say I've got

00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:22,740
the time to run a deploy to upgrade

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:24,210
these other parts of the system that may

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,270
have different security vulnerabilities

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:30,290
that aren't quite as critical or maybe

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:33,060
it's a massive performance increase

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,310
except that risk - again we know this

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,190
isn't easy we know that a lot of folks

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:40,620
have contractual obligations for up time

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,990
but contracts never last forever

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:48,930
so maybe the next time you revisit that

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:50,610
contract you work towards that are those

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,740
service level objectives service level

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,970
agreements right consider those you

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,980
haven't objected that you're planning to

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,950
meet with that agreement maybe you're at

00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,480
a hundred percent uptime right now you

00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,700
can introduce some change you can eat

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,770
under do some feature upgrades maybe

00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,370
you're at 80 percent and you were trying

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,200
to agree to 99.99 probably not in the

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,730
best shape right doesn't mean that you

00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,230
don't deploy that critical patch that

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,459
needs to go out there it means you need

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,830
to look at it with a little bit more

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,060
scrutiny decide hey is this the right

00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,800
time because I want to make sure I'm

00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,110
building trust with my consumers and

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,620
introducing that risk when I have the

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,240
error budget to do so sure so you know

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,160
we've talked about some cultural changes

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,770
we've talked about now now you've got a

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,740
great system that everybody is

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:36,690
you know deploying patches - and it's

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,390
automated and you've got upgrades going

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,480
but what if you build it and none of the

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,190
app developers want to get on it they're

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,370
very happy where they are deploying to

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:50,809
their kubernetes pod or to their

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:55,230
WebLogic server or to their lamp stack

00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:57,660
to go very classic so let's take off our

00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:00,390
painter hats and let's put on our

00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,190
philosopher hats and I'm going to ask a

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:06,240
very odd philosophical question because

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:09,690
it's one that has a right answer if you

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:16,679
have a prod and it's not taking prod

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:18,960
traffic is it really prod exactly so you

00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,460
need to deploy your apps to prod you

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,040
need to deploy them early you need to

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,190
deploy them often prod is the happiest

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:32,460
place on earth unlike maybe some theme

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:34,320
parks but it's important that you know

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,960
you partner with an application team to

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,610
really get buy-in you partner with an

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,800
application that's maybe taking a lot of

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,720
traffic maybe has a lot of high value at

00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,360
your company sure things like an SSO app

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,370
or a payment processing app exactly and

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,530
you say hey we're gonna go through this

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,870
journey together we want to help you

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,000
along the way there's going to be some

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,620
bumps I can almost guarantee that but

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,179
we're gonna take it together and I want

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,510
you to picture this you're standing in a

00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,980
ledge we're all behind everybody and

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,929
you've got a product platform team over

00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,020
here saying yeah down there is great

00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:09,240
it's amazing you should really try it we

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,740
love it everyone's look at each other

00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,730
like why would I jump off this ledge

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:17,550
right right what you need is that one

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:20,070
person one person who jumps off that

00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,480
starts the flow they get down there they

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,120
start singing the praises about how

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,100
great it really is but we were are you

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,970
saying if all your friends jumped off a

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,460
ledge you jump - I kind of hear I'm

00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,530
saying maybe in reality we can be

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,630
livings in this situation we can kind of

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:39,450
encourage that kind of attitude and the

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,010
idea is if I hear someone else is being

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,250
really successful on it maybe I heard

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,610
deployment times are happening in menace

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:49,610
versus ours I'm hearing those success

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:52,820
stories I want to go join into it can be

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,320
great fun yeah and just to recap what

00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,240
we're talking about you know

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,120
remember if prod isn't taking prod

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,980
traffic it's just wasted hardware it may

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,400
not be your hardware it may be the cloud

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,170
but you're still paying for it so

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,500
deployed properly deployed a prod off

00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:14,630
and and learn from your failures and

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:17,330
maybe just maybe slow the lemmings down

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,330
a little bit because what if we built it

00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,280
and everybody comes all at the same time

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,870
right obviously a problem or problem you

00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,640
may have just created by having that

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,230
first lemon limiting jump off the cliff

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,670
now you've got three hundred people

00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,860
saying hey this sounds great

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:34,820
I'm onboard let's go tomorrow you're

00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:36,230
like whoa hang on a minute this is where

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,280
you have to balance that right so you

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,110
may be partnered with that first

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,850
application Josh mentioned maybe it's an

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,550
SSO app so maybe it's a simple web

00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,650
service and you say as a platform

00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,120
product team hey I'm gonna focus on

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,120
maybe this capability

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,100
I like web services we're gonna start

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,720
with them first work through some of the

00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,950
kinks hold hands with some of the

00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,110
development teams that are getting on

00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,580
board for the first couple of tries and

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,370
then maybe I'm pretty comfortable to say

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,440
hey I'm gonna open the doors to all web

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,850
services can't come on board we've had a

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,190
few go we've had some success stories

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,810
let's let them come on and then you

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,940
focus on the next capability and the

00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,980
next capability to really help kind of

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,830
slow that roll a little bit you want to

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,660
be slow in study to win race and it also

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,140
gives you an opportunity to test some

00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:24,140
things out get it wrong a few times make

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,840
some changes and adapt as you go you

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,850
partner with them and you can eventually

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,650
feel pretty comfortable with those 300

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,500
people that are coming on board right

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,090
because if you do that or rather if you

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,010
don't do that and everybody shows up at

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,190
once then you have concerns around say

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:42,560
observability you know your logs are now

00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:45,140
maybe 300 times or four hundred times

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,550
more full than they were before we're

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,210
going to talk about logs a little bit

00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:56,750
later because it is her favorite subject

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:58,340
one of it's her favorite happen when

00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,900
those 300 applications were trying to go

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,550
to production because maybe you didn't

00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,140
try it out a few times maybe there was

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,640
just an application miss configuration

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,470
that you weren't aware of or that you

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,510
needed to make some more educational

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,429
time with you've got to think about that

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,420
your blast radius can be a lot wider so

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,640
if you kind of go with the slow and

00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,230
steady approach and then you open it up

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,970
to the masses as you go you're gonna be

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,800
a lot more comfortable with time right

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,240
because those logs may not actually be

00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,710
structured the way you thought they were

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,750
gonna be structured and it's going to

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:26,929
make them much harder to search and to

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,940
write the appropriate queries for in

00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,910
addition maybe your dashboards that you

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,740
have showing you health of the system

00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,660
maybe they're getting overwhelmed

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,090
because you don't have you know

00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,720
appropriately scaled in gestures or

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,190
maybe you know maybe you take down your

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,230
log system we're gonna definitely talk

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:50,000
about about that a little bit later soon

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,410
is the problem where you've had a bunch

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,490
of alerts coming all at once

00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,870
yeah experience that and then you're

00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,610
like oh I don't know which one matters

00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,840
and which one doesn't matter and I'm

00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,640
having a hard time telling the

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,080
difference if you do this slow and

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,790
steady role you can have some chances to

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,770
make some tweaks on that same thing on

00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,240
the application side maybe they have

00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,070
it's a different system that they're

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,020
deploying to so as an application

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,640
developer you want to take a chance look

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,710
and test figure out what your logs are

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,120
going to be and slowly roll on is you

00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,130
maybe have a smaller number of people

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,390
there right and you're also going to get

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,580
a chance to make sure that your error

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,640
budgets are actually holding up to make

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,560
sure that you chose your s loz wisely

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,020
and to make sure that you're calculating

00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,150
your SLO s appropriately because that's

00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,130
really hard there were talks at SR econ

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,990
last week about calculating your error

00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,910
budgets correctly that I highly

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,740
recommend you check out when they become

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:46,429
available on YouTube probably this week

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:48,800
or maybe next yeah let's talk about is

00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:51,830
all the hardware guy yeah and we don't

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,510
mean it walked out we don't mean that it

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,820
was a Black Friday sale and people came

00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:58,190
in and took it we just mean we've used

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,620
it all so this is a pretty good segue

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:04,070
into capacity planning anyone doing

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,630
capacity pinning no in just a few people

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,759
you mind just trying it let's see how it

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,959
works

00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:12,699
yeah so most companies have a fairly

00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:14,799
long lead time when it comes to getting

00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:16,659
actual hardware in the door but that's

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,190
just your opinion that is that is it

00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:20,019
does not represent the views or values

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,709
or opinions of my employer is only my

00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:23,320
opinion

00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,969
mine alone because I'm not running out

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,769
to Best Buy and buying a server and

00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:28,570
installing it myself right probably not

00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:30,849
a lot of people are we've got a lot of

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,229
process in place you've got a lot of

00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:33,190
teams involved you might even have a

00:24:32,229 --> 00:24:35,440
separate infrastructure-as-a-service

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,029
team that you're dealing with that's

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,769
even going to be true in the public yeah

00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:41,139
the public cloud does not protect you

00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:44,440
from this if you have to do quota

00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:45,009
increases or get VPC increases on your

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,719
account

00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:49,149
you know sometimes that account is tied

00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:50,999
to a VP's email address you know hard it

00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:52,809
is to get a hold of a VP sometimes

00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:53,499
sometimes it's very difficult and it

00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:56,409
takes a while

00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:59,440
lead times are real no matter where you

00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:01,269
are and there they are and so the idea

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,739
is if you're using some of the tips that

00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:05,589
we talked about earlier and you're

00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:06,549
gradually introducing workloads you may

00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,039
have a little bit of a chance of

00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:11,399
mitigating some of this right including

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,659
not buying all your hardware at once

00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:15,069
looking at it and it's sitting idle

00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:16,629
there you're only using like maybe 10%

00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:19,059
of all the hardware that you think you

00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:21,339
need forever and then maybe someone

00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,799
comes along and borrows some of that

00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:25,569
hardware right and borrowing hardware is

00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:30,579
like people borrowing my CDs in high

00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:33,959
school they're just they're gone but

00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:33,959
where did my Smash Mouth CD go then

00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:42,279
because it's just walking on the Sun so

00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:43,329
this even has to do it then you're on

00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:45,399
your platform side you're worried about

00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:46,929
actual physical Hardware right on the

00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:48,909
application side you might be worried

00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,739
about instances you might have to think

00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:52,329
about hey what ball you move traffic am

00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:53,709
I going to have and you really need to

00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:56,019
think about how you're going to scale

00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:57,309
that appropriately this is again where

00:25:56,019 --> 00:26:00,399
I'm going to say testing is so

00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:02,199
incredibly important performance tests

00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,759
understand what your load is going to be

00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:05,349
understand how many instances you might

00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,999
need in a new platform or a new

00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:08,829
environment so that you're kind of

00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:10,899
planning for this and you're gradually

00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:12,190
introducing it right auto-scaling your

00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:15,279
apps will not fix your performance

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,740
problems it might make your performance

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,750
problems worse

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,940
but in addition to considering the max

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,650
capacity for your whole foundation and

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,170
for your apps you need to think about

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,580
your max effective capacity folks that

00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:32,320
are actually running Cloud Foundry how

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:36,650
many of you are running in three AZ's

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,690
anybody running in five if anybody's

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:43,460
running in one just save yourself the

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:46,640
embarrassment it is it is I'll give you

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,140
that but if you're running threesies

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,940
we're gonna use that as an example it's

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,790
a pretty common example you should

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:56,780
really be running at about 67 percent of

00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:59,660
your capacity because when not if when

00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:02,720
you lose an AZ just ask Amazon when you

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,520
lose an AZ you can failover all your

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:11,870
apps and all your components and there's

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:12,770
room you need to have that space to make

00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,960
sure that things are still running

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,280
smoothly on the application instance

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,870
aside we talked a little bit about that

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,910
earlier make sure you don't just have

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:22,100
one if you have one and that thing

00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,360
happens to get upgraded you're out of

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,920
luck you've got to make sure that you

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,450
have the number of instances available

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,430
to really spread that load and take

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,810
advantage of effective capacity right

00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,610
and if you are running singleton apps

00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,800
because that's what the architecture of

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,930
the app requires maybe it's time to look

00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,960
into re-architecting the app unless you

00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,400
can handle downtime exactly you can't

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,050
have AI availability with only one

00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:49,100
instance keep in mind you know you

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:51,290
really have to think about if you plan

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,060
that 67% you've got to think about that

00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,980
budget and making sure that you're also

00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,150
planning that for your team's - you

00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,010
don't want to run in your teens about a

00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,830
hundred percent either right right we're

00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:03,910
gonna talk a little bit about that later

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:08,150
so let's kind of go into a segue here

00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:11,270
root cause analysis is a topic that is

00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:13,130
far and not dear to my heart but how do

00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:16,520
we do it when the root cause is actually

00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:19,580
gone so how many people have experienced

00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:23,450
a failure before gonna be used in narak

00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:25,280
failure yep yeah and then what happens

00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,560
if someone comes along and says hey what

00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,630
was that root cause who caused that

00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,039
failure

00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:32,750
happens a lot right we can ask that

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,120
quite a bit and what happens in this

00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,190
case if maybe your Bosch resurrector

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,460
magically fixed the problem for you

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,900
server no longer exists and you got to

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,270
ask say what's the root cause of what

00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,770
happened and I'm gonna throw a grenade

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,409
here and say that there's no such thing

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:50,270
as a single root cause in a distributed

00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:54,110
system like Cloud Foundry it is a very

00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:56,679
complex distributed system 99.9% of the

00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,950
time maybe higher availability than that

00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:03,559
that number that cause is going to be a

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:06,440
complex confluence of events that may

00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:08,710
not be related in any way it just

00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,600
happened to hit all at the same time

00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:14,330
maybe we can identify some of those

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,669
events hopefully we can correlate them

00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,590
and that's why it's incredibly important

00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:21,070
to think about logs where your logs

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,900
going I told you it was her favorite

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:26,419
they just disappear with that fix that

00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,159
magically happened I hope not right I

00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:29,690
hope that they're going to a place where

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,159
you can look at them later or you can

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,720
say hey what really did happen don't

00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:34,850
have a history of what's been going on

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,770
in my system can I take a look at that

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:39,140
because you don't want to lose those and

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:42,470
we're going to talk even more about logs

00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:46,400
right and maybe it's not a big failure

00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:49,280
where something you know died and a VM

00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,980
was recreated maybe you had a thousand

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,780
percent spike in latency maybe your app

00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,460
started serving requests every minute

00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,620
instead of every a hundred milliseconds

00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,370
or something like that how many folks

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:03,530
are running a PM tools for their apps

00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:06,020
wonderful if you're not there's a lot of

00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:08,750
folks in the foundry that specif are

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:11,240
that specialize in a PM tools go talk to

00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,950
them I'm not here to make a pitch one

00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,419
way or the other on any of them they all

00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,370
do things a little differently and you

00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:18,650
can find what's perfect for your company

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:25,280
but go check them out a PM is very

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:26,960
important to figure out what's happening

00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,970
if you don't have the logs that tell you

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,400
a story right do you really want to try

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:35,510
to guess while your latency spiked a

00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:37,250
thousand percent I don't I know I just

00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,899
want to know right I just want to figure

00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,480
out what happened because I'm interested

00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:42,190
and I want to think about how I can

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,630
prove things later and that's the idea

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,040
go back to something that you can

00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,540
actually take a look at and say hey I

00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,540
can make this thing better I can put in

00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:53,850
some improvements and if you don't have

00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,850
those tools good luck

00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,780
so here's someone probably a lot of

00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:02,080
people's favorite topic what happens

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:04,059
when the regulator's get involved you're

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,460
excited to hear that what about security

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:09,549
change compliance what happens when

00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,140
those teams get involved yeah

00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:12,880
well I'm hearing some grumbling I'm

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,750
hearing that too we're about to rock

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,730
your world

00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:18,490
so who here have to worry about

00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:21,460
sensitive data sensitive workflows NPI

00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:26,049
SPI all the famous data terms out there

00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:28,270
any TLA that n deny and how frequently

00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:30,460
do you happen to talk to your corporate

00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:33,190
security groups or maybe your regulators

00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,780
your change or compliance may be that

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,030
you talk to them about twice a year when

00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,470
they come in to audit your system they

00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,309
say hey here's a whole list of things I

00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,900
need you to fix tomorrow right it's

00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:46,690
probably what may have led to the

00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:49,660
grumbling earlier and here's the thing

00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:52,840
I'm gonna tell you a really really big

00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,960
secret those people in change those

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,840
people in security those regulators

00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:03,220
they're people - is anybody from change

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:07,030
or security in the room I don't believe

00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:10,390
you but they are that's the idea they're

00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:13,030
people and the idea is to treat them

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:15,940
like people get them involved in your

00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,650
process early so that they're not coming

00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,880
in twice a year and giving you a list of

00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,290
things that you have to fix instead

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,090
they're there from the beginning they're

00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,630
bought in they're like hey let's do this

00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,150
together

00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:28,419
how can we make changes as a team and

00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:30,790
not just as an individual units it's

00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:33,340
really important to also take a minute

00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:35,559
take a step back and think about your

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,690
production flow how do you get a change

00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,250
from a developer's workstation all the

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:42,070
way into production is anyone mapped out

00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,660
that flow before it's a really fun

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,820
exercise to do if you haven't and I

00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,809
highly recommend it think about all the

00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,850
different things that you have in place

00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:50,830
the wait time that's built in the

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,640
automation that's there all the things

00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,590
that you may have

00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,140
put on that doesn't necessarily need to

00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,490
be there right and I bet the first time

00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,350
you do it you're not actually going to

00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,900
believe the number that you see I've had

00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:05,320
customers do the value stream map and

00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,900
start to finish was 18 months and they

00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,390
didn't believe it because you also

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,800
uncover maybe some processor control

00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,960
that people have put on in different

00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,460
areas that doesn't have to be there and

00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,260
so when you involve the security folks

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,240
that change folks the regulator's in

00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,040
that conversation they can help you tell

00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,750
that story and say hey this is something

00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,000
that doesn't actually have to go there

00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,410
that's process we can remove and then

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,790
you can look at once you remove the

00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:30,070
process it doesn't need to be there

00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:33,370
what can we automate how can we make

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:35,440
this faster let's still meet security

00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:37,480
and compliance requirements that's the

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,670
key right and as you're building out

00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,990
your platform team and we're going to

00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,670
talk about that a little bit more later

00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,410
it's really important to go as

00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:47,200
cross-functional as possible if you can

00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:49,120
get someone from your compliance team or

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,430
someone from your InfoSec or corporate

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,300
security team dedicated to the product

00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:56,650
do it do it immediately because you're

00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,420
going to be able to educate them on the

00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:01,090
platform and you're going to be able to

00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,430
work with them because here's the thing

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,820
a lot of these scans a lot of these

00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:09,669
scanning tools they are built for kind

00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:12,340
of a more traditional pure virtualized

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:13,870
infrastructure model and when you run it

00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,090
on a path like cloud foundry you're

00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,560
gonna get a ton of false positives I've

00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,090
seen it happen every time I've done it

00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,890
you're gonna get a ton of false

00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,780
positives and if you can educate them on

00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:25,240
the platform and show them why it's a

00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,909
false positive you can work with them

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,630
because as you continue meeting your

00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:33,159
compliance goals you are going to

00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:35,140
fulfill the requirements on that

00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,230
compliance checklist in a way in a lot

00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:40,570
of cases that was not written because

00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:44,580
the platform just does things a

00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,580
different way and because of that

00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,440
because you may learn things from them

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,090
you may teach them a little bit about

00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,950
the platform they may teach you a little

00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,780
bit about compliance and security and

00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:57,670
some things to look out for and then you

00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,830
can work together to automate a solution

00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,900
that's really cool that you can put out

00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,760
as a group then maybe get your gear

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,369
changes in a production a lot faster

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,170
than they were

00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,599
for that's why this is so important okay

00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:12,079
two things one I'm now convinced that

00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:15,200
their people and two I fibbed a little

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,539
bit earlier I said we didn't put these

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,329
in any order but we did wait a little

00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:21,349
bit we saved our favourites for last so

00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:27,710
we're gonna go to Stephanie's favorite

00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:31,009
first which we may have foreshadowed all

00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:32,539
right so we're on Safari now and all you

00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:34,880
see are logs they're everywhere there's

00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:36,440
logs everywhere logs logs logs and I

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,479
can't get rid of them they're everywhere

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,219
and they're overwhelming my system I

00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:42,440
don't know what to do

00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:44,180
guess who here has a log collection

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,749
system all your logs are going somewhere

00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,069
yeah that does not surprise me how great

00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:50,539
is that if you send millions and

00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:53,839
millions of logs to that log collection

00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:55,969
system all at once it's not a great pub

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,900
great you're probably in that situation

00:35:55,969 --> 00:36:00,829
where you're like there are too many

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,599
logs everywhere and part of that is

00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:04,130
because there's a great thing when it

00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,539
comes to a lot of these cloud platforms

00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:08,569
all of the new technology that's coming

00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:10,430
out so you get a lot of power get a lot

00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:12,890
of freedom to do a lot of really cool

00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,569
things write the quote one of my

00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:18,469
favorite Marvel movies that's out there

00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:21,039
with great power comes great

00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:22,489
responsibility and that's key here

00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,259
absolutely

00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:25,940
you know the Cloud Foundry foundation

00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:29,200
has been preaching for years the freedom

00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:33,400
to create but the freedom to create also

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,029
brings the freedom to make bad decisions

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,890
yeah exactly

00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:38,420
you know maybe you didn't make a bad

00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:41,239
decision maybe you just you know

00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:44,539
accidentally left a check off and now

00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:47,319
everything is in debug mode and you're

00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:50,989
sending a million lines of logs an hour

00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:55,759
to your to your log system maybe a

00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:59,839
minute yes exactly just you're buried in

00:36:55,759 --> 00:37:01,910
logs in the log plow and here's the

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,739
thing debug is an awesome tool right

00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,869
it's great when you have a problem and

00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:07,729
you need to debug something and you need

00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:10,099
to figure out what's happening but

00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:11,900
please make sure that you turn it off

00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:14,329
that's like the one thing I want you to

00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,350
walk away with is use debug for good not

00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:17,180
for evil

00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:23,240
right has anybody in here written a

00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:26,780
custom fire hose nozzle cool thanks Sean

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,820
maybe if you guys and if you folks

00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,040
excuse me if you folks decide that you

00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:34,370
want to write a custom fire hose nozzle

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,970
ahead filtering in from the start

00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:40,960
maybe filter out the word debug just

00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,960
skip those messages

00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:49,640
no one wants those logs showing up in

00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:51,410
Prague right and some of your bigger log

00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,290
collection systems have interesting

00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:56,600
licensing models where maybe you pay for

00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,250
the amount of data that you index and

00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,930
let's say you're in debug mode and you

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,180
accidentally get in an infinite loop of

00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:07,730
exceptions and you blow through your

00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:13,550
index allowance in a day for the year it

00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:15,080
can happen and the idea logging is

00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,220
always great you want to make sure that

00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,690
you know that your systems are doing

00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,780
what they're supposed to be doing but

00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,610
you want to do it the right way and some

00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,770
of that's also going to be educating

00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:26,630
folks so maybe if you're moving from a

00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:29,240
different platform to a newer one that

00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,530
it lets you have more freedom it's about

00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,870
working with those application

00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:35,210
development teams educating them on how

00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,830
this thing works you do have a lot of

00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,720
freedom you do have a lot of power so

00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,650
here the ways that you can use that here

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,780
are some things that you can do a little

00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:45,110
bit differently but still get really

00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:50,980
great results all right so this next one

00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:52,700
I think it's Josh's favorite it is okay

00:38:50,980 --> 00:39:00,220
there's that word again

00:38:52,700 --> 00:39:02,810
I don't like that word perfect Oh

00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,820
perfect perfect doesn't exist in the

00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:06,710
tech world

00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:09,860
all right let's yeah okay that is better

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:11,210
let's build a good product team and we

00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,790
haven't said the word product team much

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:16,460
yet but that's what I mean I mean a real

00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:18,530
product team and you may think but cloud

00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,240
foundry is the product or my APM is the

00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:22,970
product or the apps that we release to

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,310
our customers the end users that is the

00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:27,830
product no the platform itself is a

00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,730
product that you provide to your

00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,310
customers

00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:33,230
your customers are your developers this

00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,300
product needs to be branded you should

00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,280
have a designer on your team it should

00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,930
be branded maybe someone from marketing

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,520
is now embedded in your team and they're

00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,710
coming up with a great name for your

00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:45,770
platform maybe it's something cool and

00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:47,570
Spacey like Galactus or Alderaan

00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:53,630
maybe not Alderaan it didn't end well

00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:55,790
for them it's fine this is fine but you

00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,100
should have that branding and you should

00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:01,580
be upgrading updating your product

00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:04,460
regularly because that's what products

00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:07,130
do they get updated regularly stale

00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:13,070
products don't get used stale products

00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:15,410
don't get bought rolls you might want to

00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:17,270
have a new product team that's maybe

00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:20,000
more of a perfect world situation right

00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:21,860
some of us aren't there and that's okay

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,960
you just have to think a little bit like

00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,580
maybe a designer we have to think a

00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,230
little bit like a tester like a QA

00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,940
person you have to think about a product

00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,500
manager and consider those things and

00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,020
actually treat it as a product whether

00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,090
or not you have those actual folks that

00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,560
have that role that doesn't matter as

00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,640
much as thinking about those things when

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,860
you're developing your product and

00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,800
putting it out right and one thing about

00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,810
a product is products need to be

00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,480
responsive to their customers you need

00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:49,520
to respond to their needs and that is

00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,530
not me up here saying that the customer

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,110
is always right they are super not

00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:55,460
always right but you still need to

00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:57,680
respond to their needs

00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,020
exactly and that comes into anything

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,940
about prioritizing a backlog maybe

00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,370
you've got one of those critical CVEs

00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,460
that Josh was talking about that's

00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:09,470
probably gonna take priority over

00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,420
possibly a customer request like that in

00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:13,460
an engine X build pack or something

00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,660
you've got to prioritize that backlog it

00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,370
doesn't mean that you forget about

00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,650
customer requests or just say oh hey

00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:20,030
you're not right that's ok if you add

00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,200
them into your backlog you think about

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,640
that because you're a product they're

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,220
your customers they should really drive

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,110
where it's gonna go right and think

00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:30,260
about that balanced product team that

00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:33,590
you will work towards achieving you know

00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,970
you should have engineers obviously you

00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:37,040
have someone to work through the backlog

00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,420
you should have product management and I

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,400
said product management and not

00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,770
necessarily project or program

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,050
management those have their place those

00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,890
folks have their place that role can be

00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,340
important

00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:50,870
maybe not part of the team directly

00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:53,840
maybe sitting outside of the team with

00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:56,840
an with a more overarching goal for the

00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,640
entire initiative at your company the

00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:02,590
designer is very important if your

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,690
company does manual QA get a tester

00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:07,190
ideally get a pair of testers and get

00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,130
them on the team so that they can help

00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:14,510
you test code that goes through test

00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:15,920
apps all of that stuff just your

00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,570
platform team you want to treat your

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,490
platform team like a product as well but

00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:21,620
it also is applications applications

00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,760
should be product teams - they should

00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,560
have things that they're doing from

00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,750
beginning of lifecycle to end of life

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,430
cycle they have on call they have

00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,900
incidents that come out their customers

00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:31,790
are just a little different right they

00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,410
might be your actual end-users and you

00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,480
as a platform product team might have

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,070
customers as developers same kind of

00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,960
concept though yeah and if you don't

00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,960
have a product team you can't have swag

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,390
and everybody wants swag everybody wants

00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,430
stickers t-shirts

00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:52,450
we're talked a lot about hats hats are

00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:56,450
great but the on call is super important

00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:58,670
how many folks here have do on call for

00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:01,210
like actually do on call for their

00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:04,370
product for the for the platform itself

00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:08,990
do any of you also do on call for the

00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:10,700
apps running on it that's not great you

00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:13,070
did not have a hand in writing those

00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,500
apps you do not have ownership of those

00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:18,650
apps you probably can't put in changes

00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:21,710
to those apps your apps and their teams

00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:24,020
they need to take that ownership and to

00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:26,600
a point feel that pain with you you know

00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:29,330
your app teams should hold a pager when

00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,070
you're holding a pager when you create a

00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:32,600
product when application teams are also

00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,520
based around products they have an

00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,900
ownership so you've actually owned that

00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,730
product from start to finish like I

00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,830
mentioned earlier and so it's not just

00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:41,630
one team that always gets called when

00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,520
something goes wrong you've a product

00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:45,020
you want to get called because you're

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,340
the one who put out the changes to begin

00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,380
with your team is the one that did that

00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,520
so you want to be the one that kind of

00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,560
looks and says hey what are some ways

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,000
that I can get better let's talk about

00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,830
what it maybe has gone

00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,150
right and how many folks in here are

00:43:54,830 --> 00:44:02,720
managers like people managers great this

00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:05,260
parts specifically for you when your

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,490
people are on call

00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,130
don't make them work the backlog the

00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:13,310
next day or when they're in the office

00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,870
but you know if they're on call they

00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,820
should not be working the backlog let

00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,500
them work on other things maybe it's

00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,330
reducing tech debt maybe it's fixing

00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,780
things they found the previous night on

00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:26,420
call this goes back to being responsive

00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:28,220
to your customers and having folks not

00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:32,120
fully dedicated to product and feature

00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:35,510
development in the backlog let them use

00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:41,150
their brains the way they see fit when

00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:42,380
they're on call yeah I think that's

00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,690
about it

00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:47,350
but we have time for Q&A if anybody has

00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,350
any questions

00:44:52,230 --> 00:45:00,350
thank you for that but that was not an

00:44:54,150 --> 00:45:00,350
answer yeah any questions at all

00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,090
oh there's one back there Oh

00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:22,660
hey it's a great presentation thanks for

00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:25,360
thanks for scripting is well our

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,340
question so in the bigger organizations

00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,010
we are different groups are responsible

00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:33,250
traditionally upstream infrastructure

00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:37,750
now we are using the product teams you

00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:40,150
talked about the culture shift it takes

00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:43,810
years it takes time right Kenny

00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:46,780
absolutely this is one place where I

00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:50,140
think that both the top-down and the

00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:53,500
bottom-up methods for building support

00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:56,530
are critical you can't you're not gonna

00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,970
be able to you know by Fiat tell people

00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,220
we were going to go cross-functional

00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:02,410
everybody's going to be happy and it's

00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,970
going to be rainbows and puppies but at

00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,700
the same time if you don't have

00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:09,730
executive buy-in if you don't have the

00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:13,350
folks that can make that change you are

00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:15,610
going to fail in different ways because

00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:17,380
if they don't have the buy-in they're

00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,730
going to see you changing the structure

00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:22,810
and they're going to make you go back to

00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:25,660
what you had before it doesn't mean you

00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:26,980
can't change things right it doesn't

00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,540
mean that Greenfield doesn't work

00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,160
because it does have you get a

00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,900
groundswell the people who are doing

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,630
something it can be really incredibly

00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:36,250
powerful and tell a story all the way up

00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,720
if you've got people who are

00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,000
collaborating who are sharing those

00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,220
failure stories you can start that

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,260
momentum towards building an entirely

00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,060
different culture and you can start that

00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,960
right at your own team right we're gonna

00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,700
do things a little differently

00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,210
absolutely a lot of time that's what you

00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,800
need to get that executive buyer okay

00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,190
but here's the thing it's gonna take

00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,230
time

00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,530
absolutely I'm not gonna sugarcoat that

00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,940
it's absolutely going to take time and

00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,750
it's what's incredibly important is to

00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,730
learn from other people

00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,530
that's where others doing it how are you

00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,790
going through that transformation what

00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:08,890
are some ways that you've done it

00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,270
differently and know that you're also

00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,980
going to face some pain points along the

00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:13,540
way things aren't gonna work out you may

00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,000
not even split up your product teams

00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,640
exactly right the first time and that's

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,580
okay be willing to make changes be

00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,320
willing to take a look at things and do

00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,000
retrospective type activities on how

00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,660
things that moves her through your

00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,980
transformation as well great experiment

00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,819
you know experiment and be willing to

00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,979
fail

00:47:30,819 --> 00:47:35,229
if you don't go into it willing to fail

00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:39,179
then you're not going to take the risks

00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:39,179
necessary to really affect that change

00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:48,819
the financing side of things and cost

00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:51,339
you know traditionally you have a budget

00:47:48,819 --> 00:47:53,410
for your IT budget very planned for the

00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:54,969
infrastructure now you're living in a

00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,489
dynamic world like you don't know what

00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:58,749
your consumption rate is going to be

00:47:56,489 --> 00:48:00,999
business desires now I can watch a new

00:47:58,749 --> 00:48:04,179
product in two months my budget going up

00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:06,449
how do we tackle those so that's a great

00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:08,799
could you mind if I tackle that one so

00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:11,079
because I've seen this in a lot of

00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:13,599
different customers everybody wants to

00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:16,239
do charge back and show back day one and

00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:19,660
that's it's not tenable you really need

00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:22,029
to effectively manage the platform and

00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:25,329
really know where where your folks are

00:48:22,029 --> 00:48:27,969
coming from what teens what orgs who's

00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:30,819
using what I mean before you start

00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:32,439
showing them and charging them

00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:35,319
effectively you need to know for

00:48:32,439 --> 00:48:40,539
yourself first and a lot of times that

00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:42,429
takes a while so when you think about

00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:43,809
capacity and you think about deployments

00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:45,159
that are going out there that's another

00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:47,049
thing you're probably not gonna get

00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:48,669
right the first time right you might

00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,349
start with a minimum number of capacity

00:48:48,669 --> 00:48:52,179
that you're giving your orgs and then

00:48:50,349 --> 00:48:53,859
that's probably gonna have to change cuz

00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,839
you have to see how usage is going how

00:48:53,859 --> 00:48:57,699
are people really using this system how

00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,099
should it look in the future maybe I

00:48:57,699 --> 00:49:01,599
have one product that has really high

00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:02,979
uses you need high capacity I have

00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,019
another one that needs to be pretty low

00:49:02,979 --> 00:49:07,959
so you've got to think about this kind

00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:09,309
of a platform that's gonna scale things

00:49:07,959 --> 00:49:10,569
that are going to change over time

00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:12,189
whether you're an application that's

00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:14,409
going out first time you only have 10

00:49:12,189 --> 00:49:15,969
users or your platform that's going out

00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:17,799
and you're looking to put new

00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:19,419
applications on them right and do you

00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:20,829
charge prod differently from test

00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:22,689
because I hope you have a test

00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:29,669
environment testing and prod is great

00:49:22,689 --> 00:49:32,049
but it shouldn't be the only place also

00:49:29,669 --> 00:49:34,419
we should give a round of applause to

00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:36,099
this room because the participation

00:49:34,419 --> 00:49:37,239
levels with all those questions I

00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:38,769

00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:43,390
