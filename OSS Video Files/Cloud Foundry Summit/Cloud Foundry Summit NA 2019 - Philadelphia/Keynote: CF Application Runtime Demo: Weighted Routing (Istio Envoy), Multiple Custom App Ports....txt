Description: 
	Keynote: CF Application Runtime Demo: Weighted Routing (Istio/Envoy), Multiple Custom App Ports, and App Revisions - Dieu Cao, Director of Product Management, Pivotal

Have you ever wanted to route traffic for a url to multiple applications in proportions that you can specify?  
How about specifying multiple custom application ports for an application to listen on? Perhaps for a hard-coded listening port? Or for exposing a management endpoint on a different route?
What about tracking changes to your application and being able to easily rollback to a previous version?

In this demo, I'll show how some of the latest features in CF Application Runtime work together to achieve all of the above, making application developer lives easier so they can focus on delivering business value.
