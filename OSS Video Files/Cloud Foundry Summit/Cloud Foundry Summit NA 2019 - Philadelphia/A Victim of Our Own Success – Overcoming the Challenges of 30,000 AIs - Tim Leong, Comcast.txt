	A Victim of Our Own Success – Overcoming the Challenges of 30,000 AIs - Tim Leong, Comcast

2018 has been a boom year for Cloud Foundry at Comcast. Because of its immense popularity with our development teams, and the easy, repeatable frameworks we have created for transitioning into CF, we have doubled in size from 13,000 AIs to over 30,000 in a single year! It’s been great to see such rapid adoption, but it has come with serious challenges. As we maintain our commitment to the success of teams going Cloud Native, we needed to overcome these obstacles and maintain the success of the platform. It was a hard year, but our team came out of it stronger and better prepared to plan for and respond to rapid changes in demand.

Let us show you how we did it. We will review our most important lessons of the last year.
