	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,670
our final panel tonight is one that

00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:10,080
obviously I'm really excited to have but

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,280
more so because we're in Philly our last

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,259
three guests are going to join me on

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,450
stage from Comcast

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,760
and I'm pretty excited to welcome them

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,250
because not just because this is her

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,949
hometown and I'm really fond of their

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,570
story but I also think that the

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,310
participants on the panel I'm going to

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,590
bring up to join me really represent so

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,179
many different parts of the business

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,030
that I think it really lends itself to a

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,790
much more broader view of what the

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,800
journey looks like from both a an

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,989
executive decision making to the

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,120
implementation of the technology to the

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,640
power open-source has as part of that

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,410
continuum so I'd like to welcome on

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,239
stage with me

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:53,370
Rick Rivoli who's the fsvp and CIO

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,469
nithya ruff senior director of opens of

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,190
the open source practice and my

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,590
Crisafulli

00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,230
the SVP of platform and product services

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:08,970
come on up

00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:12,299
[Applause]

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,299
[Music]

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,110
practice your names I did not practice

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,000
the fsvp you got rebo lee though that

00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,100
was I did yeah you know at least I got

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,190
one thing right it's been a long day

00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,780
people it's been a long day I'm actually

00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,340
excited to end today with the

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,920
conversation with the three of you

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,869
because we often talk as I said about

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,210
the transformation journey and bits and

00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:38,800
pieces of open source or platform I

00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,660
think this is a first opportunity we've

00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,259
had to have the entire continuum in one

00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:47,710
organization on the stage so I actually

00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:49,659
want to start first with you know a

00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,300
really difficult job which is leading

00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,429
this initiative and Rick you've been

00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,560
working to transform Comcast now for

00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:59,050
several years and this has been quite

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,390
the undertaking maybe if you could walk

00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,840
us through you know how that journey

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,649
began and and the process you've taken

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,789
you know it's particularly on the

00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:08,739
culture side because I think you've got

00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:11,799
a great story on the culture piece yep

00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:15,250
love too so yeah I joined I joined

00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:17,500
Comcast about 14 years ago as of last

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,329
week was my 14 year anniversary so when

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,930
you were like 12 I was like 12 years old

00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:25,200
absolutely and and it was funny when I

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,250
joined the company we were very much a

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,650
we just we had just become the largest

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,120
cable company in the country and we were

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:35,109
very much a cable company we were all

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,180
about set-top boxes cable modems you

00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:39,250
know rolling out hardware trucks call

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,780
centers operational efficiency that was

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,299
what that was what our story was all

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:47,829
about and and we were a self-proclaimed

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,989
fast follower in terms of product and

00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:51,910
technology and we that was sort of our

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:55,060
story that was our strategy coming out

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,350
of the gate back about 14 years ago we

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,750
came to the conclusion though pretty

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,310
quickly that in order to compete in this

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,650
industry and looking forward that we

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,850
were really going to have to become a

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,150
product and technology company and we

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,590
invested a huge amount of money and

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,989
energy into becoming a product and

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:14,440
technology company just out of curiosity

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:17,200
how many hands hands for customers

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,480
Comcast customers I know this front row

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,090
is going to be

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,950
customers and just out of curiosity how

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:28,080
many folks have liked the x1 the voice

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:30,390
remote pretty pretty good yeah so so

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,950
that was the x1 the voice remote would X

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,780
Phi a lot of the product advancements

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,370
that you've seen come out over the last

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,670
couple years or the result of a big

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,950
investment in technology and just a huge

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,349
cultural change within Comcast from

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,030
becoming an operational cable company to

00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,160
a technology and product company and

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,230
then interestingly enough over the last

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,880
couple years we came to the conclusion

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,190
that it really even wasn't enough to

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,290
become a great technology and product

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,860
company we need to be a customer

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,690
experience company and what that means

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,010
is what is it what does it mean to

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,769
really create a great customer

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,019
experience from from the time you buy

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,140
our products to the time we support you

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,480
and ongoing lifecycle of a customer and

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,940
that was a really that was like our next

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,229
cultural shift as a company was how do

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,760
we go from not just building great

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:20,430
products and technology but creating

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,770
great and end experiences and so that's

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,120
the big that's the big journey we've

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,020
been on over the last couple years it's

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,330
been super exciting it has been exciting

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,800
and you know it's part of this journey

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,139
and I actually had the pleasure of

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,690
speaking at your open source day a few

00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,630
months ago here in Philly feels like it

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:42,300
was just yesterday nithya but one of the

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,639
most powerful things that that I got to

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,630
hear was a lot of your executives

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,039
getting up in front of the room and

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,810
talking about not just the culture

00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,789
change part of it but how important open

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,710
source was to that journey which is not

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:54,419
something you often think about when you

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,770
think about Comcast is Wow open source

00:04:54,419 --> 00:05:00,450
right and so nithya you know you've been

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,690
a part of the Comcast team and you run

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,669
the open source program up is you talk a

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,970
little about the journey for Comcast on

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:11,160
the open source side absolutely so it's

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,780
it's really fun to be here and and

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,810
welcome you know Cloud Foundry to

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,010
Philadelphia I consider it my second

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,789
home even though I live in the Bay Area

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:24,330
so it was around the time that Rick

00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:27,360
mentioned you know around 2004-2005 we

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,430
made that switch from just procuring

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,240
proprietary software

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,120
or if you will commercial software and

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,060
move to starting to consume open-source

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,470
software in our you know desire to build

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,260
our own products build our own

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:47,100
technology and then very soon after that

00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,840
around the 2000 I get a 10 timeframe we

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,270
realized that it wasn't enough to just

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,450
consume we needed to actually contribute

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,910
back any changes we made and and frankly

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,850
sustain open-source and you know do our

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,000
part to give back to open source and

00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,950
then since that time frame the scale of

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,620
open source consumption and contribution

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,140
has been spectacular so just to give you

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,660
a statistic we did about 13

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,570
contributions I think around the 2013

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,870
time frame and then the last year we did

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:22,950
about 165 a pretty major contributions

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,990
that's and you can go check out some of

00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,570
the open source projects we have open

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,930
sourced on Comcast github do

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:33,810
there are over 150 projects that we have

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,200
open sourced all for all kinds libraries

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,480
front and back and a big one is the

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,910
content distribution network that's at

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,070
Apache foundation it's called the Apache

00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,530
traffic control another big project

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,080
would be the software stack that runs on

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:52,050
your set-top boxes and routers and it's

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,880
called the RDK project and it's a

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,700
collaboration across a lot of different

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,670
companies so so tremendous growth from

00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,160
consumption to contribution to actually

00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,660
creating original project that's

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,850
phenomenal it's also phenomenal to think

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,230
about the set-top boxes on top that

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,960
actually are running an open source now

00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,180
which is that's come a long way in the

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,920
last ten years

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:17,100
absolutely and Mike you're you know

00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,360
responsible for the platforms that run

00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,550
all of these things from a technology

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,710
standpoint how do you you know you kind

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,330
of sit literally in the middle of these

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,030
two things but I think figuratively also

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,260
between the the directives from the

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,940
executive and the leadership and the

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,890
culture change that's happening as well

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,240
as the work that's happening on open

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,500
source side you know how are you

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,390
bridging all of those things together

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,950
for the product choices you're making

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,780
sure great no thanks to having yeah I

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,370
mean it's um billion offer Eric said

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,440
what we quickly learned in the journey

00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,570
was you know we say happy cuz

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,270
our happy business and for me and going

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,560
through a four or five year

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,450
transformation leveraging both the great

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,760
technology around cloud foundry and open

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,250
source we learned quite a bit about the

00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,640
people the culture and like happy

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,740
developer happy business right like we

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,140
had to really adjust our internal

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,060
development you know buzzword bingo

00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,850
around DevOps and things like that but

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,220
it's really about frictionless happy

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,050
developers where we're creating very

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,760
crisp outcomes that translate the

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,250
strategy like Rick mentioned customer

00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,410
experience outcomes around that and

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,000
really changing the game there if our

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,160
developers in our development community

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,390
don't experience the same transformation

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,410
the same focus on acting and behavior on

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,330
a day to day basis in a very

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,190
frictionless digital way how would they

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,070
present that from a platform or a

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,530
product perspective so it's been a great

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,960
cultural transformation from the

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,280
perspective of learning not and I say

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,650
just it's an important part the

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,180
technology aspects but the adaptive

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,910
leadership that came with that as well

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,170
as really empowering the development

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,480
team through the technology but also

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,610
through getting out of the way from from

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,070
a top-down from a leadership perspective

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,330
and in bridging the strategy through

00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,860
creating that same environment for a

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,060
development community you don't often

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,150
hear that getting all the way part

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,290
that's yeah it took a lot it was a my

00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,000
team will tell you we had some very

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,560
passionate moments when we were we had a

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,730
lot of performance a lot of resiliency

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,740
problems a lot of trust with the

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,310
business we went through this big

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,840
cauldron of change and we had big great

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,480
tipping points where you said let's have

00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,730
crisp out puns and outcomes empower the

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,020
development community leverage the open

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,670
source like really create a true

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,530
community internal not just as we

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,180
contribute externally and it's it's been

00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,740
a really fun journey yeah that was

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,250
actually one of my favorite stats that I

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:37,350
got from Greg today Greg is everywhere

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:39,030
um you know the 1500 people that are

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,290
active on slack and that they're helping

00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,180
and they're building that community and

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,680
I think that you know we talk about a

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,760
community a lot in open source and

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,720
nithya knows we always have this

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,530
conversation by CUNY but it's also

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,120
interesting that you're actually

00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,970
building a community you're inside

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,920
Comcast - yeah absolutely and changing

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,780
the way changing the way that you know

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,920
we develop platforms and you know

00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,910
clearly we're not there yet the

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,709
transformation

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,149
more than four or five years but there's

00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:03,000
been some really great just tipping

00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:05,459
points and we really empowered the Dec

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,010
this organic drive to this frictionless

00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:10,620
value that the open source technology

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,180
Cloud Foundry the whole environment that

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,490
we've created and it's just it's so

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,190
refreshing to see and it's um you know

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,110
not having that big top-down management

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,149
style that's it's really refreshing it's

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,290
and the outcomes are great so it's great

00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:24,540
and you could say that with the

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:30,480
management here yeah absolutely yeah no

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:31,680
it's a management yep so we're you know

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,600
you can actually say that with a

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,880
straight face absolutely I mean we

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,170
talked a lot about open source and an

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,459
errata open source conference so

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,440
obviously I'm gonna lean heavily on the

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,570
open source but how is open source and

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,579
participating and making it part of your

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,589
core product offering how has that

00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:48,209
changed the way that you you work and

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,350
maybe this is something any of you want

00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,649
to answer with I think I look at it from

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,050
a culture and a technology standpoint

00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,610
yeah I think so what changes it

00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,279
definitely changes the way we think

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:02,100
about the way we build the technology so

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,079
I think I was referencing back when I

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,970
first started and when we were really

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,720
all about buying products from vendors

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,640
and and the way it worked was you know

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,350
we were a big obviously a very big

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,720
company we would tell the vendors what

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,490
we're looking for and they would give us

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,620
these long product roadmaps

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,570
right and then we would wait around for

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,160
a product to show up and in the meantime

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,550
you know we'd be testing and all that

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,709
and it was just a very typical of

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,120
waterfall process we developed like

00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,579
product requirements we'd give them to

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,130
the vendors they'd build out a roadmap

00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:37,740
you know so on and so on and and now

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,230
with open-source and with the you know

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,970
software development teams we have it is

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,430
much more of a dynamic environment right

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,350
we we can control our future we can

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,779
contribute we can come up with great

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,060
ideas we can innovate and then we can

00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,019
build that into the technology and we

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,670
don't have to sit around and wait for

00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,860
everybody else and then we also get

00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,529
contributions from everybody else so for

00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,050
us it's it's absolutely been a massive

00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:03,449
shift right and definitely got us out of

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,579
that sort of total like vendor

00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:08,100
dependence mentality that we had a bunch

00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,650
of years ago it's awesome and I mean

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,420
from the platform standpoint and

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,910
with a plug Cloud Foundry here obviously

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,160
but you know you know that's an open

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,540
source platform as well as the

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,710
surrounding technologies how is that

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,630
impacting the way you think about

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,279
product and platforms yeah it's it's

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,529
like building an opera Rick said the

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,990
dynamic kind of flexible aspect that

00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:29,540
some what was again really if I tie it

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,029
back to the development community it's

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,190
just it's a it's refreshing it's it's a

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:38,390
very innovative the the great team that

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:40,130
we have the desire to contribute be part

00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,690
of the community and then clearly that

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,830
provides a business value back to like

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,800
what Rick was saying to what we deliver

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,120
day to day and just people participating

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,029
in that ecosystem seeing our

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,120
contributions it actually pushed on the

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:54,320
broader comcast culture a little bit

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,690
just like what Rick mentioned in terms

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,430
of where we've been from either security

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,400
or a legal profile perspective and and

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,810
just it's just refreshing to see that

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,339
kind of all that shift together is kind

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,680
of driven by the technology and then the

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:08,180
impact that it had so it's all really

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,820
tightly coupled that's really hard to

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,170
separate those things the only other

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,300
thing I would add is I think when it

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,650
comes to one of the big culture shifts

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,190
we made when we started to become a

00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,870
product company was platforms we started

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,720
to really think in terms of investing in

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,760
platforms and I think before that we

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,790
used to think about projects and

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,709
implementing individual things and I

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,910
think we we made a big shift several

00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,020
years ago when it was really around the

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,630
time we were building out the x1

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,880
platform where we realized wait a minute

00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,600
if we're really thoughtful in the way we

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,490
we develop our software and we're really

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,130
future looking we can build things once

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,410
and reuse it over and over again and it

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,750
became sort of a very big mantra within

00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,330
our technology organization is we build

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,670
platforms we don't run projects and we

00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,230
not only took that mantra on the product

00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,459
and technology side but we also brought

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,540
it over to the IT side of the house and

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:04,310
started attacking our problems in a

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,250
similar way and that was definitely a

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:10,130
big culture slash mind shift as well

00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:12,080
that's phenomenal I'm learning so much

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,339
on you know during this conversation

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,760
even though we've talked a couple of

00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:17,959
times I'll say just processing that and

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,610
thinking about the number of products

00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,620
you're now creating you're not just

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,540
contributing back to existing projects

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,520
you're creating

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,380
projects in the open source and and

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,870
using that to power both your business

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,540
but also drive that community engagement

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,670
you know have you seen an at the end I'm

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,050
going to go off-script every minute but

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,300
I was coming back to the numbers you

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,820
just threw out about the projects you're

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,900
actually putting out there now have you

00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,100
seen that drive a bigger interest

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,660
internally and the in the communities

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,280
that you're building inside Comcast's

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:52,120
have you seen those projects really get

00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,890
people excited absolutely in fact very

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,920
often some of these projects start out

00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:59,830
as inner source projects where teams

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,540
across the company will contribute to

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,130
the project and will actually their

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,290
users of the project they start

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,750
contributing to the project and you

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,480
start kind of honing your skills as a

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,060
community inside the company and then

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,030
once it goes outside it becomes you know

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,700
much more successful an example of that

00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:22,060
would be a project called vinyl DNS

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:26,050
which is DNS as a service it's used by

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:28,060
people across the company and many of

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,820
these users used to wait for this small

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,500
team to maintain that project but soon

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,480
when we opened it up they realize that

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,400
they were empowered to make the changes

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,740
themselves and they didn't have to wait

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,230
for you know the maintainer of the

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,820
project and then once we open sourced it

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,720
we're seeing a tremendous amount of

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,710
interest from other users and other

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,410
contributors who are taking it far

00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:53,050
beyond you know what we had imagined so

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:57,670
I'm seeing it's it's been a huge shift

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:59,290
also in how people perceive us more and

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,480
more when I go to open-source

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,640
conferences people actually see us as a

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,070
technology player as an open-source

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,710
player which helps us then attract the

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:11,500
right developers and you know the right

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,150
technologists into the company and if

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,970
anyone's interested we actually have a

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:19,600
booth here and we are recruiting and we

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,880
have a lot of ta folks here and we have

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,830
a lot of people and and a plug for

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,160
Philly Philly is a fantastic city to

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,620
live in and work in and

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,519
and be in and the culture of Comcast is

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,870
a terrific culture for developers and

00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,329
it's a great place have a conference and

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:38,879
turns out to yep

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,779
well I mean you know I just I have so

00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,269
many questions that could Rex you

00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:44,069
probably run this for like an hour but

00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,870
you know because I think you you both

00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,129
hit on there all three of you hit on the

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,870
points I think a lot of people are

00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:50,220
really excited about in terms of open

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,920
source and technology and platform

00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,790
building but also the culture and the

00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:59,040
leadership I think one last question I'd

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,209
love to hear from all of you is you know

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,220
what are some of the obstacles that

00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:03,389
you've had to overcome in your

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,880
organization I realize again this is

00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:08,039
gonna be put you on the spot but I think

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,209
we love to hear stories about what are

00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,000
some of the challenges you've had to

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,559
overcome because we all know and I know

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,809
everyone in this room knows this is not

00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,949
an easy journey this is not something to

00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:19,049
your point you're not going to do it in

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:22,110
three or four years and it requires

00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:24,030
everyone be part of that process so you

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,589
know if maybe if you could you know list

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,120
out maybe a few of the obstacles you've

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:31,140
had to overcome as part of this now

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,909
first how much time do we now we've got

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,880
all in the world I think the option you

00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:38,789
know it's we're the obstacle I mean

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,010
scale is clearly you know from an award

00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:43,530
change management perspective if you you

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,940
know with what we have to deliver to the

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,309
business every day and balancing that

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,440
with the transformation but it's you

00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:52,500
mentioned it earlier a B but kind of

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,909
self-awareness to really drive that

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,559
empowerment that risk-taking

00:17:53,909 --> 00:18:00,750
it's the letting go like the obstacle of

00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:03,530
as a either a leader evens in in you

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:06,720
know technical leaders as well it's it's

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,970
letting go taking more risk and trying

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,860
to overcome that mindset obstacle the

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,409
technology is difficult at scale it's

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,299
hard but I'm gonna say that's kind of

00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:17,309
the easy part relative to that you know

00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:19,169
I say that often yak is the easy part

00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,090
it's a change that's hard partner

00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:23,610
exactly and so just as self-awareness

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,990
for my from a loot like don't try to

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,260
change everything out of the gate pick

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:30,690
and empower and have clear outcomes and

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,580
then let go and then trust and verify

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,890
and I think when we rinse and repeated

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,480
that we had some really good outcomes

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,070
for the business it wasn't just a kind

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,720
of nerdy technology thing that we did

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,000
and coupling that and giving

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,490
people a sense of purpose and mission in

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,380
that context was really it literally

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,830
took us about a year to figure that out

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,659
that was one of the biggest obstacles

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,809
yeah I think I would say so I'm about to

00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:57,450
insult everybody in the audience here

00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:59,220
but I would say the biggest challenge we

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,480
have is I've been leading software

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,490
development teams for a whole bunch of

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,049
years and usually it's the smartest

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,510
software developers when you tell them

00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:09,150
you know go make a left or go use this

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:12,270
technology or go use this platform this

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:15,480
is the strategy they put like every

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,919
ounce of energy and chip proving you why

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,210
that's not the right answer

00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,970
right and they all kind of want to go

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,409
over this way and so I think one of the

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,720
biggest challenges we've had over time

00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:27,000
is is we've we went from almost zero to

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,980
over 10,000 software developers and I

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,530
think Comcast and as we grew that

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,830
community we wanted it to be a very

00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:37,409
innovative community and so we let folks

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,820
kind of do their own thing and then as

00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,400
we've built up some of these platforms

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,809
and technologies and said hey everybody

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,360
we really think it would be great if you

00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:46,799
did this you know a lot of them would

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,520
kind of say oh if that's what you know

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,200
management wants me to do you know well

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,429
that's probably not the right answer we

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,870
probably need to go do something over

00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:57,360
here so just kind of getting everybody

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,370
aligned on getting on to a common

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,799
technology a common platform a common

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:05,010
way of doing things the whole change

00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:07,559
management aspect to it I have found

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,600
over time has been has been challenging

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,460
with with some of the developer

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,350
community but what I found works really

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,480
well and you know that I think the way

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,450
we get there is it needs to be a

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,309
grassroots thing it works best if there

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,350
isn't like a top-down mandate go do it

00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:25,260
this way it works best when there's

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:27,480
someone like I'm Greg who says hey I did

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,640
this thing check it out you try it you

00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,510
try it you try it and you start to get

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,770
this you know brown bag lunches and you

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,070
start to get this groundswell of

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,559
grassroots around it and then it's like

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:43,350
it takes on a whole new life and I think

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,990
that's the way you beat the that's the

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:49,020
way you kind of the best way to get

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,980
really a cultural change management

00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,169
program going on

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,480
something like this that's yeah it's

00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,889
amazing I think I I know I often hear

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,990
the question I'm like alright this is a

00:20:55,889 --> 00:21:00,809
lot to do where do I get started if I

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:03,450
have 10,000 developers how do I start

00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:06,679
because taking off 10,000 at one time is

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:10,019
a lot right so starting small and then

00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,360
you know in a Thea I'm gonna put you on

00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,100
the spot also because you've built an

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,309
open-source program office at Comcast

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,409
and I know I've heard from a lot of

00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,700
users in the audience how do you get

00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:23,519
that how do you get that started cuz

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:27,360
there's so many hurdles internally you

00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,190
know legal PR like how do I get that

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,539
started so maybe you could walk through

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,610
a couple of the obstacles that you've

00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:35,639
overcome to get where this amazing thing

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:38,039
is today you know ironically one thinks

00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:40,019
of legal as an obstacle and in our case

00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,080
legal was the instigator of the

00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:45,899
open-source office and they're fantastic

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,480
people we have a great legal team and

00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:51,690
the reason is they were getting

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,909
inundated with developers who wanted to

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,190
do more open source had a lot of license

00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:57,899
questions and wanted to contribute to

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,360
open source and they would say you know

00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:02,340
help me help me help me and so legal

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,380
said we really need a center of

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,840
excellence in the company around open

00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:10,529
source who could serve as the first line

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,419
of questions in support if you will for

00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:15,000
our developers right and act as a

00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:18,419
translator between developers and legal

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,850
so the first obstacle wasn't really an

00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:22,769
obstacle because legal was on board the

00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:26,429
second obstacle often tends to be

00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:28,830
leadership sometimes business leaders

00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:32,279
may not see this as important to the

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:34,710
business but again we had an ace here

00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,690
because people like Mads Alaska is the

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,080
chief software officer for the company

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:42,539
and Rick saw the value of open-source as

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,480
a means of innovation for the company as

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:47,399
this is we do need to innovate this way

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,279
and we need to empower our developers

00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:52,649
this way so we had so much support from

00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,510
the top from the legal team that it was

00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:57,029
easier to start the open-source program

00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:59,879
office that way that's where most

00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:01,889
companies struggle with starting an

00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,809
open-source program office right and if

00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:05,549
you can get your leadership on your side

00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:07,409
and if you can get your legal team on

00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:09,629
your side developers are already on your

00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:12,179
side they're chomping at the bit to do

00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:15,029
open source it's just setting up at

00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:18,149
scale some of these processes like open

00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:20,279
source approvals license you know and we

00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:22,099
want to respect licenses and we want to

00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,330
contribute back it's engaging

00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:26,609
systematically with external communities

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:29,009
that Cloud Foundry and the Yocto project

00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:31,169
for example which we rely on and being

00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:33,419
members of organizations like the Linux

00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:36,989
Foundation the Apache foundation so that

00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:39,299
we can learn from our peers just as Greg

00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:42,179

00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:44,729

DLF and the Apache foundation and other

00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:51,869
