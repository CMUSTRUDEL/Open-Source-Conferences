Description: 
	Air-Gapping: A Moat for the 21st Century - Michael Ferris, Stark & Wayne & Vincent White, Agile Defense

The best way to ensure that an unauthorized, external bad actor cannot take advantage of your platform is to make sure they cannot reach it in the first place. For this reason, many organizations choose to run their PaaS in an on-prem, air-gapped environment, meaning there is no path between the public internet and your PaaS, either inbound or outbound. However, air-gapping a PaaS without using the proper processes and tools can drastically slow down your Operators and undermine the benefits that the organization adopted the PaaS for in the first place. In this talk, Mike will outline the implications of running your PaaS in an air-gapped environment, including changes to the installation process, the running of apps, and the ongoing maintenance of your air-gapped platform. Vince White from Agile Defense will share his war stories with you about the most common pitfalls of running a PaaS in an air-gapped environment and how to avoid them.

all right so uh hi everybody people

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,500
still rolling in come on

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,370
talking about air gaps can we fun all

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,110
right we'll get started

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,089
so hello everybody my name is Mike

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,130
Farris from Stark and Wayne and I'm

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,100
Vincent white from agile defense I am

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,600
with agile to Fitz I just like starting

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,920
away and so much so I was supporting him

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,410
today he likes the shakes all right

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,230
that's just what Omega should you know

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,490
agile defenses in the house yeah all

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,830
right and so today we're gonna be

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,070
talking about air gapping and so Vince

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,780
and I have actually worked on a project

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,399
together recently where our two

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,840
companies came together to work in an

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,340
air-gapped environment and so we're

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,590
going to be talking about some of the

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,120
pitfalls we faced with installing PCF

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,010
for cloud foundry in general or and

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,440
really any paths in general in that kind

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,170
of environment and providing still being

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,140
able to provide the experience that

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,699
users expect from cloud foundry in that

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,719
air gapped environment and if you don't

00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,670
know what air gapped environment is

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,500
we'll talk about that a second it's next

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,960
slide okay so what is an air gap it is

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,460
the 21st century moat if you're in an

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,400
air gap network you are in that castle

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,930
and you can't nobody can get into the

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,600
castle nobody can get out I don't know

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,070
if there's a drawbridge here but no

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,960
bridges in an air-gapped environment

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,240
can't get in can't get out to the to the

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,180
internet and so a way more boring

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,009
diagram with zero castles is right here

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,380
where you see the Internet at the top

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,770
and you ever got the environment

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:37,380
next slide boom no internet everybody

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:40,200
clear internet no pop quiz okay so so

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:49,049
what is our what our organization use a

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:54,580
house so basically it is to protect us

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:58,950
from internal and external hackers or

00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:01,450
yeah or so basically yeah it's basically

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,990
protecting the environment from internal

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,340
or external hackers right we're

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,050
obviously external hackers are people

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,640
trying to get in trying to compromise

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,680
your system trying to take advantage of

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,120
ports that are open to the Internet that

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,440
you might not know are open to the

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,540
Internet or you might not know have a

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,330
vulnerability where they can get in get

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,560
root access to start doing funky stuff

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,910
and obviously the best way to make sure

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
nobody gets in is make sure nobody has

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,110
physical access in the first place and

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,580
then internal by internal hackers we're

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,620
just talking about people in your

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,870
organization rogue employees that might

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,390
want to install software that has not

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,340
been deemed okay by the organization and

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,770
just rogue employees in general that

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,060
might compromise your network by

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,000
thinking they're smarter than everyone

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,710
in installing whatever they want and so

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,940
obviously there's a lot of bennet the

00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,830
benefits that we just talked about but

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,070
with any benefits obviously there come

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,960
cons in the big cons with installing a

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,550
pass especially like hog found

00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,310
recoupment under kubernetes in one of

00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:00,030
these environments is that one all those

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,989
binaries that you use to install

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,489
kubernetes and all the documentation

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:05,380
everything is tailored towards an

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:06,610
environment typically all the detail in

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,260
the documentation is about an

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,270
environment where you have access to the

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,250
Internet all the installation patterns

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,050
are gonna go and grab things from the

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,489
internet pull them down and so when you

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,709
don't have access to the Internet you

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:18,730
are going to hit some complications that

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,290
we're going to talk about that will

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,470
ultimately slow you down that's the big

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,320
problem that we want to show you in this

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,239
presentation how to solve how did Matt

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,900
get slowed down too much by an

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,980
air-gapped environment and so for

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,810
developers obviously there's

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,430
implications on every engineer using

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,890
every software engineer within an

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,180
organization so for developers the

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,980
implications are going to be that their

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,110
apps obviously cannot use the Internet

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,390
so don't write your apps to use the

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,160
Internet pretty simple and then also for

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,720
building your apps a lot of especially

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,580
like in Cloud Foundry for example you

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,410
use build packs and a lot of those build

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,830
packs they actually go out and they'll

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,930
download Joe if it's the Java build pack

00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,040
it'll download jars that you need a lot

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,390
of things that you need for the build

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,770
process will come from the internet so

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,140
in that case you want to use things like

00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,760
offline build packs basically like I

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,020
said with the running of the apps don't

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,120
make your app use the

00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,350
Internet with the building of the app

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,950
don't make the building of the app use

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,270
the Internet

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,750
but in this presentation I'm gonna be

00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:19,300
focusing on the operators so let's go to

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,520
that and we might be biased as operators

00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,050
but here's the how complicated air

00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,810
gapping makes the developers lives and

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,680
then here's how complicated it makes the

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,680
operators lives

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,010
so with those complications right sorry

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,810
cons installation complication for us as

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,320
whatever road that you may be planning

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:45,100
on on the platform team from the delve

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,080
I've seen two engineers because one

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,730
you're talking about now all right

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:55,150
what like like we stated earlier what

00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:58,360
installations can we download that we

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:01,150
that needs all of the supporting detail

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:05,380
are supporting software's or

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:07,000
installations to map that out and then

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,070
from an engineer level and then take

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,350
that over to the air-gap environment so

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,870
I that within itself there's a

00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:17,260
complication because as we know there's

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,480
a lot of moving pieces to it upgrade so

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,830
after you have insulate our platform or

00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,070
install and upgrade

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,750
I mean it's installed you at some point

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,150
of time of course you want to look at

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,740
upgrades so know your whatever role you

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,140
play your course it goes back to

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,360
understanding what pieces are needed to

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,330
upgrade making sure that though it falls

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,070
in the guidelines and the protocols that

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,790
is necessary and whatever environmental

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,860
situation that you're in and like Mike

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,840
stated earlier no use of the external

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:51,610
services so that those external services

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:54,400
are github for for repositories harbor

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,650
doctor any of those type external

00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,520
services now you have to engineer okay

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:02,350
we got a builder's on the air outside to

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,890
make sure that we can emulate the same

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:08,620
process or a scenario on the non-arabs

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,060
on our right and we want to go back one

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,570
slide is from sorry we just called that

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,780
out specifically because that obviously

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:18,160
complicates your life in when you're

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,870
doing installation or upgrades you're

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,260
pulling down from external services for

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,170
example with PCF you pull down

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,920
PIPP net you pull down the docker

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,750
containers you need for your concourse

00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,870
pipelines from docker hub and you can't

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,700
access those another reason that might

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,590
complicate your life is depending on how

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,060
many hats you wear as an operator or on

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,980
the infrastructure side of things your

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,050
developers who now also can't use those

00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,720
external services might be coming to you

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,280
to replace to give them a alternative to

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,660
use those solutions so it can kind of

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,210
have a double whammy effect of

00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,320
increasing your responsibilities as an

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:56,650
operator and so let's run through an

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:59,510
example of so with installation of PCF

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,550
obviously pivotal ships Concours

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,790
pipelines and so those will install your

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,260
PCF on and is and it's going to if you

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,140
if you're not air gapped it's going

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,340
those pipelines are going to be grabbing

00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,840
artifacts you need from pivot it's gonna

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,730
be grabbing the docker red docker

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,230
containers you need from dr. hub it's

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,540
gonna be grabbing the pipeline tasks

00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,250
from github your life's going to be easy

00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,100
it's gonna be great except oh wait we're

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,810
air gapped we can't talk to any of those

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,430
so what you instead need to do for

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,440
installation is you need to have like we

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,120
mentioned internal services to match

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,620
each one of those an internal service

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,420
corresponding to each of the external

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,430
services that you can no longer talk to

00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,680
so in this case you'll have an internal

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,180
blob storage where you'll put with the

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,040
things that would typically be in pivot

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,560
and so that can be anything like me know

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:46,340
any typically s3 compatible blob storage

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,920
is typically your go-to mini o Ceph if

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,890
you're on OpenStack anything will do and

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,500
then so to match docker hub you'll have

00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:57,280
an internal docker registry VM harbor

00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,530
VMware Harbor is a example of that and

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,320
then for to match github or whatever

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,580
external git repository you were using

00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,020
you'll instead have your own internal

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,610
one that like Vince mentioned now you

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,650
have to build out all these services and

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:14,540
that is increasing your responsibilities

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:17,540
as an operator and just like I stated

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,950
earlier this piece right is a part where

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,800
okay

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,360
from whatever hat ideally the engineer

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,900
will have to come in and put this

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,170
together somebody because you know to be

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,120
to be effective you want it done the

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:35,000
right way as much as possible the first

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,620
time there's a lot of going back and

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,390
forth so the engineer Peaks where there

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,410
would be tremendous a tremendous help to

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:44,480
that yeah and so so obviously you're

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:47,330
you're wondering you're thinking okay

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,950
this is great we've got these we've got

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,960
these services that magically contain

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,520
all the blobs we need we've got a docker

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,370
registry that magically contains the

00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,930
doctor containers we need this diagram

00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,300
kind of implies that everything's all

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,800
set to go and we just got to build these

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,330
but we actually have to populate them

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,160
with the things we need so how do you

00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,960
get the things that are typically in

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,640
pigment into your internal blob storage

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,250
if you're in an air-gapped environment

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,780
so the best practice and you'll see

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,120
there is an asterisk next to that next

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,430
to that basked because this might you

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,680
you might go to your security team and

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,850
start the sentence to say hey we might

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,690
want to have a date and they'll say no

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,580
you can't do that

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,820
so best obviously depends on the

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,830
environment you're in on what kind of

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,820
regulations your security team is

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,080
imposing on you and so this is best as

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,790
in it's going to make the operators

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,530
lives easier but it might just not be

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,060
feasible within your organization so it

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,850
really depends on the organization but

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,070
anyway so the best practice for making

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,430
your life easy as an operator is to be

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:49,040
is to have a DMZ a demilitarized zone

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,660
which basically ends up being one VM or

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,120
a couple VMs that are white listed on

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,970
the network and can talk to the internet

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,920
but can also talk to the air gap and so

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,460
what you would do is run a concourse

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,920
pipeline or whatever your CI is and

00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,570
specifically have a yeah Mel file a yeah

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,730
Mel file defining your pipeline that

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,320
calls out each resource that you need to

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,480
grab from where it needs to be grabbed

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,210
from which version you need to grab and

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,650
then where you need to put it into your

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,110
internal services and this makes your

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,790
life really easier than the alternative

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,800
which we'll get to because now you have

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,170
in addition to that pipeline being the

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,030
thing that actually does all of the

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,400
grabbing for you it also it ends up

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,050
being documentation of which resources

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,150
which versions of which resources are in

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,740
your system and

00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:36,430
you've just got a nice list that you can

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:40,630
then modify and run later if you need to

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:46,420
get a new version and so that's the best

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:52,500
practice worst practice so worst

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:57,220
practice worst practice so basically is

00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,800
we're walking from one building to go to

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,560
another building that has internet

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,710
access it's a burning our bond there is

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,650
artifacts real pacts whatever those are

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:10,420
to a DVD so as we're walking we're

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,060
making sure that we have a case of CDs

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,630
or DVDs and I had and we're going over

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,110
to the other area to to burn what we

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,190
need

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:24,220
so in adding to that you find out so you

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,530
go there you you download whatever if I

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,050
narrow bill Pat you have and you put it

00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,090
on a dish you get back and you're ready

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,910
to go you know you got those binaries on

00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:36,040
that dish you saw it before you love

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,380
they're all there and you get over and

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,290
you start pushing those bill packs or

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,960
uploading those binaries and you find

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,610
out that is kuroh completely

00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:52,060
hypothetical this didn't happen to us

00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:54,670
hundreds of times so you're trying to

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,280
figure out now and we literally sat and

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,960
did this be like deep dive we know the

00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,240
files are there like maybe something is

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,430
wrong in the file so we're changing you

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,010
know different things you know in

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,150
amplify learn that in that bill pack and

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,340
this is like oh no okay

00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,320
so if I know that is correct so now we

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,290
are marching back across the street to

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,080
play that same file that same barn area

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,550
back on the dish and the DVD to make

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,750
sure that is there and then we're coming

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,790
back and trying to basically it's a it's

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,710
a rinse and repeat type thing right till

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:31,410
we get in the right one so ideally what

00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:33,400
you want to have okay

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,870
yeah if you get one thing out of this

00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,480
entire presentation this would be it

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,070
yeah just in Scituate if you find

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,040
yourself in a situation like this where

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,810
you have to be going many uh somewhat

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,200
manually or completely manually going in

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,209
download

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,380
all the resources that you're gonna need

00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:52,149
for your system don't wing it plan ahead

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,240
and think about which binaries you're

00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,649
going to need because it's going to make

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,060
your life a lot easier and it's going to

00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:01,089
make you way more effective as an

00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,889
Operations team and if you are winging

00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:04,870
it like I said you're developers are

00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,100
going to notice eventually and because

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,930
you're going to be moving very slowly

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,279
and you're going to kind of your teams

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,370
kind of kind of going to be a dumpster

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,690
fire so plan I had about which binaries

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,610
you need make a list of all them

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,570
beforehand it's an easy it's a harder -

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,790
harder said than done

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,810
but it will definitely make your life

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,690
easier that's something that me and

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,399
Vince learned on the job yeah I think

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,690
the other piece that I - is just making

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,149
sure like you have those necessary

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:31,120
parties in there to plan ahead like

00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:33,070
developers do if if you're not you know

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,500
developers on the developer side is

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:38,940
making sure hey you know can you sit

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,160
with us and we do our a whiteboard on

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,709
pieces that you guys need or have used

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,209
in the past or we can factor all of that

00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,589
in it because now what you're doing is

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:49,690
making sure that you have the supporting

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:51,880
tiles and those sort of things to make

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,220
sure that those developers are able to

00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:00,070
be impactful in what they are doing as

00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:01,510
well so as every operations person knows

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,930
once you've installed the platform your

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:07,329
job's done

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:08,800
you're good mission accomplished and so

00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:10,089
obviously that's not true you still need

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,829
to maintain the platform

00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:14,310
you still need to upgrade the platform

00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:17,079
and you want to be doing this in a

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:19,120
regular cadence and providing

00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,410
functionality that opera that developers

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,839
are requesting and being able to do that

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,190
in a timely manner and so in order to do

00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,380
that properly it's going to go back to

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,779
exactly what I just said if in the best

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,640
case you've got your pipeline to find in

00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,470
a Yambol file where you're just changing

00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,540
which resources you need in that Yambol

00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,100
file and you run the pipeline it grabs

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,630
them down and you're good to go and

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,980
you've still got the ammo file to

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,709
finding nicely every single resource

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,199
that you're pulling into the system and

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:45,430
then in the worst case where you've got

00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:46,750
a walk across the parking lot with the

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,660
DVD it come back

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,270
stand in line maybe planning is going to

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,620
be everything in

00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:58,360
having a good regular upgrade cadence

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,380
and velocity being able to provide

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:06,340
requested features to your developers

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:09,640
yeah and so let's talk about Vince and I

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:12,220
each have our own respective experiences

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:16,210
outside of our experience together on

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,220
that one contract so I've worked in I've

00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,170
had a lot of experience working in

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,870
situations where the best practice that

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,370
we talked about was allowed and so we

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,650
would have like I mentioned that

00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,150
pipeline that was just defining

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,280
everything that we needed to pull down

00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,170
and once we had that pipeline defined

00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,700
and every everybody on the team was

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,830
aware of how that pipeline worked and

00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,630
what you needed to do if you wanted to

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,390
upgrade and get a new get a new version

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,820
of a binary and/or add a new version and

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,410
who you needed to talk to in order to

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,270
make sure that that those whitelisted

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,740
VMs in that pipeline were within the

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,120
constraints of your security team and

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,500
you weren't going to get yelled at once

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,570
all that was taken care of up front the

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,880
operations team weren't slowed down very

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,330
very much if at all by the air-gap and

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,880
so like it that's why I say it's the

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:08,410
best case if your organization will

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,870
allow that kind of setup and so you have

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,360
been on a couple of engagements where

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,980
that kind of setup has been allowed and

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,740
it's like I said it hasn't slowed us

00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,940
down too heavily and it's allowed us to

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,790
to installations in a timely manner

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:24,730
without looking up without us looking

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,950
like a dumpster fire and two upgrades in

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,020
a timely manner and be able to stay up

00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,170
to date with versions of the platform as

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,660
it comes out and being able to provide

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:37,870
functionality as it's requested by users

00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,640
and so Vince isn't a little bit of a has

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,870
been in a different situation a couple

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,680
of times until you can talk about that

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:48,030
yeah I mean it's somewhere similar just

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,410
some more there's edit pieces like cross

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,670
in the air gap environment you have to

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,010
have from top down

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,720
Atos right yeah

00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,950
there's a number of things I said I

00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,230
won't go through that list because it's

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,670
long but there's a lot of compliance

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,180
that you have to ensure that you're

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:06,339
staying inside oh so planning is like he

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,650
says it's definitely like that's like

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:12,699
number one like if you the planning

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:17,110
piece can make that our installation in

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:19,240
a in an air-gap environment much

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:22,150
smoother and when you have the right

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,050
parties and people that's a part of that

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:29,200
for us in our environment we had

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:32,290
different people that we reached out to

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,960
that help in different perspectives to

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,930
help make our planning a little bit

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,910
easier and I'm talking about from from

00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:43,170
the installation piece from the security

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:46,000
piece from the compliance piece from

00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,160
vulnerability from all of those aspects

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,250
like we had different people we could

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,460
reach out to to make sure that we were

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:56,770
inside of that arena to to get past the

00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,870
hurdles or when we started on at home so

00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,600
a microsecond of my earlier is you know

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:04,660
going back and forth and I just paint

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,690
like a less small picture of you know

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,060
points that are not high is you know you

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,010
start out with this offline build pad

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,860
and you find out there's other pieces

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:17,140
that you need of that offline build pad

00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,400
to make that pickup that work so if

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,010
you're if you're talking with someone

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,110
like Mike that knows the outside pieces

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,030
of what makes that build pad work it's

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,460
like okay hey let me jot this down where

00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:30,340
you will put a list together so that

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,310
when we walk over we can have as much as

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:36,450
as much as we can get on and those DVDs

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:39,640
or whatever and bring it back over and

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:42,250
and be successful and just deploying it

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,840
offline or pushing that offline bill pad

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,420
so that we could be over health

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,610
yeah those trips start to add up if

00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,370
you're winging it and not planning ahead

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,020
and coming back every time and saying

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,010
okay now we need something else okay in

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,310
that case you might want to hire an

00:18:54,010 --> 00:19:00,340
intern

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:02,770
and just a side note about each of our

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,920
respective experiences my experience is

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,300
where we are allowed to use those that

00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,090
best practice that I talked about with

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,050
having a pipeline do this for you and

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,610
basically self documenting all the

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,170
resources that you pulled in via AML

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,300
file that also doubles as your pipeline

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,390
that does it for you that tends to be

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,190
those have tended to be in financial

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,110
institutions and whereas Vince's

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,700
experience with completely not being

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,460
able to do that not even being able to

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,690
finish the sentence asking for uh asking

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,230
for permission to do that those have

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:33,820
tended to be in more defense the defense

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,370
world of side of things so if you so if

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:40,570
you are a consultant who might be doing

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:42,850
defense type stuff in the future or or

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,830
you are in the defense sector and you're

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,200
thinking about doing platforms would

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,570
definitely recommend heavily investing

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,310
yourself in your team in planning ahead

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,260
with which binaries you're going to need

00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,610
and knowing that ahead of time obviously

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,050
it depends on the platform that you're

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,630
installing the flavor of the platform

00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:01,300
everything to know what those to know

00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,650
what those are and but yeah that's that

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,090
I'd say that was that would be my one

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,890
big takeaway from this presentation if

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,640
there's any planning ahead and not not

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,470
trying to wing it

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,720
because been like like we've said Vince

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,060
and I did that at first and it didn't go

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,350
well we had to kind of pivot and think

00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,210
of something better think of a better

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,220
way to do it the entire installation

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,200
really like we was privity right you

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,940
know with our team we really didn't like

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,230
through the entire situation maybe a

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,300
better process really made all the

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,500
difference folks our velocity as an

00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,540
Operations team and being able to

00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,790
actually provide functionality to

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,310
developers and so our my concern about

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:37,030
if your consultant is is are definitely

00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:39,430
sitting down with the devil teen or

00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:42,070
whatever team just to understand the

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,650
restraints or front that they are

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:47,950
dealing with so you can that can be a

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:50,430
factor factor than to your solution or

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,800
installation plan as well mm-hmm yeah

00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:57,450
so you know which things to download

00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,620
your own planning ahead yeah because the

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,740
software's not gonna do it for you in

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,870
this case um so yeah that is our

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,210
presentation at air gaps and installing

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,840
platforms anybody have any questions

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,960
we'd be happy to answer them

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,960
yes sir

00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,250
yeah so that would be it obviously

00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,020
depends on the solution that you're

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,450
using that's actually doing the looking

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,940
but for example in concours it's just a

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,310
matter of changing the yeah Mille file

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,990
to changing the URL on the amble file

00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,070
maybe some some of the parameters if

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,570
it's a completely different kind of

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:38,220
service all the credentials are being

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:40,420
passed and whatnot but I've never used

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,670
Jenkins or anything like that or any

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,320
most other CI things but I cannot

00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,660
imagine it's really similar to changing

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,970
the URL of where that's pointing to most

00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,320
of them most of them seem to be a pretty

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,090
plug-and-play at this point where you

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,620
can just interact with different

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,230
services by just changing URL maybe

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:59,460
changing some of the parameters yeah

00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:11,980
yeah there's a cycle order ID ideally

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:15,430
yeah so it depends on the environment

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:18,970
obviously some yeah some environments

00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:21,520
the proxies typically come into play in

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,260
that DMZ type of environment where you

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,210
do have access to the Internet but it

00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,670
needs to go through something that might

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:33,100
be regulating your traffic checking HTTP

00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:36,280
headers things like that and typically

00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,050
the biggest problem is that I that I've

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,210
run into with proxies and environment

00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,350
like that is forgetting that the proxy

00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,080
is there and forgetting that you're

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,340
talking to the proxy and thinking that

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,890
you're talking to something else and

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,120
trying to decode the error messages if

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,760
you're talking to something else but

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,810
forgetting that the proxy is there so do

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,790
you have a does that answer your

00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,330
question do you have a more specific

00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,330
like

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:03,420
yeah I got you yeah okay yeah

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,010
typically in that DMZ pattern that I

00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,670
talked about there would be a proxy that

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,030
yeah correct

00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:10,590
yeah I think just act like you know

00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,990
defense world like most the time if

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,270
you're sitting in a DMZ

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,560
you're pretty much good unless you come

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:21,000
across some pieces that are hard coded

00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,650
if they're not hard coded you should be

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,450
pretty much good as far as like any

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,910
traffic going in and out through that

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:30,290
DMZ that's in the defense side like I

00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,290
said well most of the time

00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,360
yeah good question so obviously it

00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:52,900
really depends on the organization um

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,790
but for so for uh you're talking for a

00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,710
security team to vet those and say okay

00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:59,260
yeah you can pull these in it can really

00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,410
I think the minimum I've seen it take is

00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,910
a week and the most I've seen it take is

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:10,930
longer than the engagement I was on so I

00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:14,200
don't know I'll check my email out for

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,790
those we didn't yeah but it can vary but

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,530
that's definitely a very very good point

00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,120
and that is another thing that can

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,370
greatly influence the speed at which you

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,220
can deliver to your developers and so

00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:26,310
getting on the same page with your

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,960
security team as far as we are trying to

00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:30,490
be an agile team that is delivering

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,200
functionality iteratively to our

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,550
developers and we're going to need this

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,020
is not going to be a one and done thing

00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,730
where we come to you and say hey is this

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,010
good we need to come back and say hey is

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,270
this good to the next version of that or

00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,920
the next version of your backer image

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,300
and being able to do that iteratively

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,470
yeah that's a very good point thank you

00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,910
for bringing that up

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,130
yeah getting on the same page with your

00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,840
security team about the iterative

00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,050
fashion at which you plan to work is

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,980
very important and can either facilitate

00:24:53,050 --> 00:25:00,340
or definitely slow down your process as

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:02,410
a operations team the added I to is

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,940
given with this young is that they what

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:07,290
configuration management like they would

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:10,810
definitely be over hell because you can

00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:16,450
ensure that versions of and versions

00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:18,700
before or after are has been vetted good

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:21,000
to go yeah yeah good point thanks for

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,000
bringing that up

00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,730
anybody else yeah

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:53,370
yeah that's a good that's a good point

00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:55,080
um a good question um so you could have

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,000
I've seen a lot of organizations have

00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,220
like a lab where you can turn on and off

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,240
in air gap functionality so you can pull

00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,130
everything in that you that you need via

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,169
the typical way turn off the environment

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,429
and make sure that using those binaries

00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:10,320
that you've just pulled in everything

00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:12,210
runs properly and then you can say yeah

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,970
from there we're good to get we're good

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,169
we can figure that we're gonna be good

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,139
to go once we move that into an actual

00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:24,120
air-gapped environment that's what we're

00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:28,380
doing does it's going to be a big help

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:32,039
agile defense there are allowed and so

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:34,590
it's an implement is a duplication of

00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:37,260
what we have in the air gap what is

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,200
needed in the air gap and then agile au

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,000
is what it's the same thing it reflects

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,750
the same it mirrors the same so that

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,820
that testing and that breaking breaking

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,440
fix least I'll be done in that lab and

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,169
you know we can push it over yeah being

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,909
able to having that lab such that you as

00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:56,760
an Operations team can toggle that

00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:59,029
air-gapped miss that would be imperative

00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,019
towards the testing of it otherwise

00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:02,250
you're going to be going back to the

00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,049
same security that's a gap in your

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,230
actual environment and it's going to be

00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:10,250
end up probably being just as slow so

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,250
yeah good question thank you

00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,480
any other questions comments concerns

00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:23,069
what's he good

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,069
[Music]

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,100
yeah yeah that would definitely be an

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,900
ideal scenario in the so in the specific

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,910
scenario that Vince and I worked in that

00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:01,500
would not have been possible because the

00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,790
computers in the place that we were

00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,990
working on there were Windows machines

00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,810
and if we said hey can we install

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,400
concourse here they'd be like what or

00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,930
any CI engine and it would have been

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,310
just a complete no go away from the

00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,770
start but yeah that would definitely be

00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:16,080
another ideal scenario obviously

00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:27,210
depending on your organization a good

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:28,710
point it's not a question all right I

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,850
think we're good thank you for coming

00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,359
everybody

00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,359
