	Air-Gapping: A Moat for the 21st Century - Michael Ferris, Stark & Wayne & Vincent White, Agile Defense

The best way to ensure that an unauthorized, external bad actor cannot take advantage of your platform is to make sure they cannot reach it in the first place. For this reason, many organizations choose to run their PaaS in an on-prem, air-gapped environment, meaning there is no path between the public internet and your PaaS, either inbound or outbound. However, air-gapping a PaaS without using the proper processes and tools can drastically slow down your Operators and undermine the benefits that the organization adopted the PaaS for in the first place. In this talk, Mike will outline the implications of running your PaaS in an air-gapped environment, including changes to the installation process, the running of apps, and the ongoing maintenance of your air-gapped platform. Vince White from Agile Defense will share his war stories with you about the most common pitfalls of running a PaaS in an air-gapped environment and how to avoid them.
