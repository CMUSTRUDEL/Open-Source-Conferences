	Microservices With Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Julian Skupnjak, IBM R&D & Georgi Dankov, SAP

Using the full power of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes to create your services... wouldnâ€™t that be awesome? With Eirini, you can use the great CF push experience and interact with Kubernetes directly at the same time. This opens up some really interesting possibility for using microservices than span both CF and Kubernetes. Come to our talk to explore the full potential of both platforms combined. Transformers unite! Get your black belt in deploying and combining CF apps with native Kubernetes apps.

Participants will learn:

- how to debug combined apps
- how to bind services to you apps using Cloud Foundry Services and Kubernetes
- how to access loggs with both, CF and Kubernetes
- how to monitor CF and Kubernetes apps
- how to implement Continuous Deployment with the combination of both platforms
