Description: 
	Introduction to the Cloud Foundry 101: Getting Started Track - Xiujiao Gao, Stark & Wayne & Jared Ruckle, Pivotal

This track covers the most important topics to help you get started with Cloud Foundry (CF). Regardless of your role, you’ll learn how to get up and running with CF. You will learn that CF supports a wide range of application architectures, so you know what workloads are a good fit for the platform.

You’ll learn from veteran CF operators. These folks have deployed and run the platform at scale and will share what they have learned.

What about the developer experience? We will take a deep look at examining how to use CF to manage applications and backing services. We will learn about building pipelines, and how CI/CD can plug into CF.

This track has something for everyone because all the technologies that touch CF are so diverse. We will learn about .NET with CF. If you’re more familiar with Kubernetes, you can learn how CF compares with this orchestrator.

Services are extremely important for apps. So we focus on how the open service broker framework works, and how it helps you run services across CF and Kubernetes.

We also know that security is important, authentication and authorization are always hot topics. You will learn how to deploy and use UAA both inside and outside of CF.

And finally, every vibrant open-source community needs as a growing pool of thoughtful, responsible contributors. How can you take part? We’ll discuss that too.

good morning everyone welcome to CF 101

00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:12,059
before we introduce ourselves

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,610
I would we would like quickly thank the

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,430
people who submitted attracted travnik

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,300
talks to this track even they are not

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,880
here because that's what really unites

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,430
us to build a such good quality track

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,210
here which covers lots of important

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,210
topics

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,290
I'm dr. sue Joker you can call me dr.

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:41,940
gahl o xj I'm more currently the from

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,730
slack on the win and I'm Jared Ruckle

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,399
director marketing from pivotal got an

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,780
exciting set of things for all of you to

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,010
go through today and as we were going

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,770
through and reviewing all the awesome

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,930
submissions we wanted to have a couple

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,600
of few things in mind we had all kinds

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,280
of submissions about security and some

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,859
more kind of advanced topics there's a

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,339
bunch of things about yo kubernetes and

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,040
as we settled on the the talks that we

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,960
did select for all of you in the track

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,540
three things really stood out when dr.

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,220
Gao and I were reviewing the talks and

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,650
so as we go through the sessions today

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,259
as well as the sessions tomorrow we'd

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,299
love for you to keep three things in

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,950
mind we talked about is three the right

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,659
number maybe it's two maybe it's four

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,689
but three seems like a magic number when

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:34,290
it comes to these kind of a things so

00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:36,390
first up yeah yeah actually I had like

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,000
more than 10 nice things about this

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,470
track in my mind and the weight of the

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,259
orchestra will be the magic number

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,450
because you probably will still remember

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,049
what our decisions after you work out

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,799
this room so first one you can run many

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,500
kinds of apps on CF so when people talk

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,350
about Cloud Foundry we already mentioned

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:04,320
cloud and native apps twelve of fake

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:06,659
tracks however is not quite true that

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,619
Cloud Foundry is only for cloud native

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:13,600
apps Richard from pivotal it's going to

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:16,540
give a talk

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,330
different type of apps we can run Cloud

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,480
Foundry so you will come out with

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,060
checklist

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,280
what workloads you can run with you

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,930
after that session it's a deep dive

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,950
session this afternoon and there's also

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,000
Richard we'll talk about this in a few

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,500
of the sessions tomorrow we'll talk

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,110
about how Cloud Foundry has really

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,260
become a wonderful platform for dotnet

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,240
applications there's dotnet core which

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,400
is kind of the the new way to run dotnet

00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,290
apps on top of Linux but if there's also

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,090
dotnet framework applications you can

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,460
run on top of Cloud Foundry as well and

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,200
you really have this multiplier effect

00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,330
when you put more and more kinds of

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,860
applications on the platform so as dr.

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,830
Gail mentioned Cloud Foundry has always

00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,770
been great for 12 factor apps but now if

00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,380
your app has maybe four or five factors

00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,520
it can run on the platform too so lots

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,260
of innovation happening from the

00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,580
community about how all kinds of

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,010
different applications with maybe

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,630
multiple application ports cannot fit on

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,850
the platform pushing docker containers

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,350
on the platform all kinds of innovation

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,780
the last few years to make the platform

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:21,580
more accessible for a broader set of

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:24,340
your application estate yeah ii assume

00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:29,140
we would like that you keep in mind is

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,300
that CF we included guardrails to make

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:37,080
you more productive efficient and a

00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:40,870
secret secure productive so with CF

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,600
developers can only focus on code so

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,580
focus on creating your apps so you don't

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,190
need a worry about how to build it how

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:52,630
to write how to scale it with this focus

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:57,670
it it make developers more productive on

00:03:52,630 --> 00:04:02,070
top of that with CF the application the

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:05,350
time deployment cycle reduced from like

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:08,410
for some companies even from years two

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:12,700
weeks from months to two days so it's

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:18,250
very efficient tomorrow

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:21,280
at 11:45 at this room Charlie balm from

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:24,370
Comcast is going to give you a talk how

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,139
they deploy and the manager like

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,060
multiple

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:31,090
action CIF environment you know very

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:37,840
efficient manner which like bring lots

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:44,199
of for business business review to to to

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:45,249
Tom yeah yeah and I think in in the past

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,499
you may have heard some things about

00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:50,020
Cloud Foundry it's a opinionated

00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:51,629
platform there are contracts and how

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,729
different components work to each other

00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:56,169
but we like the term guardrail so it's

00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:58,810
pretty cool for us to hear

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:01,710
Schwab who's adopted Cloud Foundry at

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,789
scale use the actual word guardrails and

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,250
guardrails when you're driving on the

00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,139
road they help keep you on the road and

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,360
you're moving forward and you're getting

00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,949
where you need to go and when you think

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,960
about you know what Cloud Foundry does

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:16,000
when you have code on your developers

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,560
laptop and then you want to get that

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,930
into production as fast as possible

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,819
there's no system on earth better than

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,159
Cloud Foundry for that type of use case

00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:25,449
and these guardrails make it happen so

00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:27,460
we'll talk about you know service

00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:29,080
brokers will talk about you some of the

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,639
other dimensions inside of Cloud Foundry

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,710
that are these guardrails that you

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,270
should know about they're there for a

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,490
very good reason and they can help you

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,620
achieve better business outcomes a lot

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,360
faster than some other runtimes and

00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,839
applications and abstractions you may be

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,029
looking at and then finally yeah it's

00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:50,680
very easy to get a start here with the

00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:55,149
CF so you can use about to deploy CF on

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,159
different is it's very easy pouch takers

00:05:55,149 --> 00:06:01,479
CAF management for you like cell for

00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:04,389
healing all that also there are lots of

00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,919
different options in community like how

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,560
you start with CF

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,439
there's also good community support like

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,460
the way I mentioned earlier charlie bomb

00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,360
from Comcast

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:19,120
he's going to share away how they deploy

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,699
manage with SDF also like a further

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,419
people are very familiar with kubernetes

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:28,960
there's also CF continuation projects

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:31,479
which allow you quickly deployed its CF

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,819
Antioch you Burnett is to start to use

00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,940
it

00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:39,120
London I can think of is using deploying

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,730
using CF

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,980
doesn't really require lots of a

00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:49,770
learning curve so that's all nice assume

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:54,030
so today the first attack will be given

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:56,699
by Tyler bird and a Tyler Poland from

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,710
Stockholm win yeah you see that we do eh

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:03,900
eh everywhere we can

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:06,660
so we leverage this Tyler application so

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,419
they will share with you just in 30

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,270
minutes no matter URL color summary

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,130
owner or your developer or your operator

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,750
they will be able to share with you in

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,240
30 minutes what do you need to know to

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,970
get a start with the CF then after data

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,210
tools from IBM will actually do a

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,740
hands-on show you okay now you have this

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,120
yes how you're going to build a

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,340
application how you're going to manage

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,160
it how you use it with a service all die

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,500
in 30 minutes for the left hand I

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,169
believe after those of you you will even

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,190
occur in more with me oh yeah yes user

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:43,889
to get started will see it and then

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,300
there are a lot of options for thinking

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,610
about how you might want to run CF

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,260
inside your organization open source

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,120
commercial options there's a vibrant

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,610
your community with different ways to do

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,729
things with hosted options multi tenant

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,740
options single tenant options and so on

00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:01,050
also hopefully we hope you'll agree that

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,210
it's Cloud Foundry is a welcoming

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,400
community and it's also easy to get

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,740
started not only with the platform

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,900
itself but as a part of the community so

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,669
we'll have some talks to kick off

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,349
tomorrow about being part of the

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,610
community and hopefully you've gotten a

00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:17,610
good sense of that in your time here

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,860
with the CF summit so far so with that

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,830
dr. Guerra and I hope you really enjoy

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,440
the sessions today and tomorrow and I

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:29,789
think we're ready for the AJ Tyler show

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,160
yes yes thank you very much for being

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:35,379
here

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,379
