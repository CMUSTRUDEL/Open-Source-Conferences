Description: 
	How NOT to Build a Pipeline - Mirah Gary, Pivotal

Pipelines are the infrastructure we use to test and deliver our code. We work with them every day, but sometimes they behave in unexpected ways. 

We will go over common failure modes and issues encountered in Concourse pipleines, and understand what we can do to prevent and solve these pain points. 

Being able to build pipelines that work for you is critical for effective dev/ops. By sharing our own mistakes, we hope that the audience will be able to recognize them when they happen and know what to do to fix the problems. 

After this talk, attendees will:
- be familiar common mistakes found in pipelines and how to recognize and correct them
- be able to build pipelines that facilitate the development process rather than hinder it
- understand how to refactor and improve their pipelines
