	Bulk Application Migration Between Cloud Foundries - Michael Brodhead, & Patrick Jones, Stark & Wayne

You have 30 days to migrate hundreds of applications from one Cloud Foundry environment to another. You donâ€™t know what any of the apps are, nor how they work. How will you take inventory of what is running? How will you move these apps to the new site? How do you know whether they have been migrated properly? Believe it or not, this is all manageable. Learn what to do from a team which has done the job many times and lived to tell about it. Ready? Go.
