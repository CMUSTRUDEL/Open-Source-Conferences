	The Subtle Art of Keeping your Broker Multi-platform Compatible - Georgi Lozev, SAP

The Open Service Broker API is a standard which allows different vendors to deliver their services to applications running within Cloud Native platforms. Today there are two platform implementations Cloud Foundry && Kubernetes and thousands of brokers adhering to the specifications. As we all know often the devil is hidden in the details and while the specifications defines the general contract for platform to broker communications there are lots of pitfalls which could make your broker incompatible. So if youâ€™re a broker author or plan to be and want to give your best shot in making your broker platform agnostic, then this session is for you! 

We will start by giving an overview of the different types of broker based on their deployment model like hosted brokers, one deployed alongside the platform or on top of it. Then we will show you some pitfalls we came across while working on CF as a platform implementations and last but not least will go over good practices and future improvements that should keep our brokers multi-platform compatible.
