	FaaS: A Contemporary, Comparative Study - Dilleswara Anupoju, Comcast

What is the latest trend thatâ€™s catching up in the world of distributed computing? The latest buzz word is FaaS or Serverless- though serverless is a misnomer because these functions still need a run time environment some where; FaaS is simply a new level of abstraction above PaaS & IaaS so that developers can run and deploy snippets of code easily.

As the popularity for FaaS grows, there is a corresponding increase in the number of FaaS flavors, available in the market; each offering is unique in terms of the capabilities and the level of complexity/abstraction.


In this talk Dill Anupoju would like present a comparative study to describe what's out there, how they work so that devs can choose from wide variety of options that's right for their use case
