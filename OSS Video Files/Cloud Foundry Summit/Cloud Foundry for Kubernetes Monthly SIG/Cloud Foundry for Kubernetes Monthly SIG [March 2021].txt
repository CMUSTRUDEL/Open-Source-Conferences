hi round

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:45,840

oh braum's able to make it this is his

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,800
topic right

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,800
i think so yes yeah

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:05,840
okay great

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,840
hi hello

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,360
well it does look like ram is online and

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,000
i i just pinged them but um

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,000
same thing here

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,400
maybe everybody thinks everybody

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,400
thanks for

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
so joining maybe wait another minute

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:24,320
then

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:27,280
get started

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,800
kind of glad that we have the call after

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,960
a couple of declines

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,039
even though it's a small round just

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:39,840
we're going to

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,840
touch base

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,919
you

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:27,360
okay why don't we get started

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,240
so ram it's actually all yours right so

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,160
you suggested a topic uh and i guess you

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,840
also get to introduce it

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,840
to the round

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,520
so historically a lot of the

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,199
[Music]

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,800
let's say outreach and the marketing

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,919
efforts have been

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,800
around how you know cloud foundry as a

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,080
technology

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,680
has a project and

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:02,560
as a tool has fit well into

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:06,240
sort of enterprise use cases

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,800
you know ways for um folks to deploy

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,360
hundreds of on across hundreds of vms

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
and

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,840
and even recently the tone has always

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,599
been um if you're using like

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,680
thousands of container images across

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,840
your organization here's the way to do

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,520
blah blah blah

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,639
one of the things that we've been seeing

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,240
recently with the cfo gates project and

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
something that we want to actively

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,560
pursue is to also

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
position cf in the form of cf for gates

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,080
as a tool for

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,599
also the small teams and the mid-sized

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,280
teams and

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,440
if you're a start-up and things like

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,000
that so personally i come from a

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,599
background

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,639
where i've advocated kubernetes um

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,560
as a tool of choice even

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,879
irrespective of the size of the team

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,400
let's say so let's be agnostic of you

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,800
know what your deep size is

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,840
what your sort of digital footprint and

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
spread is

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,479
um you can always you know get started

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,400
on a containerization journey

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:11,680
and keep kubernetes uh not for the day

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,800
when you start scaling but even you know

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,639
from

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,440
right from the beginning it can be part

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,560
of your

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,479
your approach to infrastructure and so

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,160
during these conversations um

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:31,759
the point always seems to be

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,919
um okay so but managing communities is

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,000
very hard and you know we probably don't

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,320
have the know how and

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,440
why do you want to force kubernetes

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,600
you know mind share on top of our

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,959
product mindshare and other things that

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,880
we have and

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,640
the conversation steers into the

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,600
territory of

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,040
is there no way that this complexity can

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,080
be reduced or

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,080
is there no way that any of these can be

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,399
simplified and

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,800
the the two choices that people have at

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,040
that point and

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,160
fortunately the number of choices are

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,320
increasing today

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,360
but the two choices the two broad

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,720
choices that

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,160
people have okay let's go for like a

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,399
managed kubernetes

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:24,160
sort of approach or let's use a pass

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,360
so obviously the past space has been

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,200
slightly more active at least in my

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,279
experience and i'm happy to be corrected

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,399
people have been thinking openshift

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,519
people have been thinking

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:43,120
recently they have been thinking um

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,720
the digitalocean app platform google has

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,920
always had

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,640
something in the past flavor for folks

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,920
to toy around with and so conversations

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,959
have always

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,480
you know centered around these different

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,880
tools that are available

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,760
in the space and so i just thought it

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,640
might be

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,079
a good opportunity and a good use of

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,440
time to

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:11,279
discuss you know what

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,320
this positioning is for cf for kids in

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,600
terms of

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
um how do we advertise it to the rest of

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,040
the world

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,680
and as contributors as you know members

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,200
and

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,079
um you know people who have sort of

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,680
uh inside seats into into what what's

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,480
going on

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,440
what are your thoughts about you know

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,640
what

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
what this looks like and um like i like

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,160
i also

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,880
mentioned in that comment now uh sap

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,480
just to

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,720
pick on a provider offers both a managed

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,640
kubernetes flavor and also

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,959
a cloud foundry flavor apart from you

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,880
know a lot of other things and so

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,120
what's the thinking there and you know

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,200
what are sort of the takeaways if i'm

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,640
looking at it from like a

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:02,000
perspective of discovering cloud foundry

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,079
and all of these other tools in the

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,920
ecosystem so just wanted to spawn

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,920
conversations and

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:14,959
get people's ideas around these these

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,959
positioning you

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,959
thank you very much so i guess like my

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,240
two initial instincts would be to say a

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,320
yes i also believe that like in order

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,880
for a cloud foundry on kubernetes to be

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,560
successful we actually need to

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,839
like also address

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,800
way smaller com or

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,200
companies first of all but then also

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,600
individual community members that

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,120
are kind of interested in trying out a

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,279
password flow

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,040
on top of kubernetes so so that would be

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,399
my first reaction

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,519
the other reaction is that like

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,519
as it is a cloud foundry on kubernetes i

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,880
believe you would still need to solve

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,959
the question of like

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,320
who is managing your kubernetes cluster

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,160
overall and

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,880
at least like in in the case of sap

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,639
we have a solution and vmware and others

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,160
have have their solutions as well

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,519
to provide this management of kubernetes

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,760
clusters overall

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,959
i think like if you if you don't have

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,800
that and are already

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:33,120
like facing concerns

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,320
from people that that you talk through

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,959
the storyline

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,440
around like we are too small to manage

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,800
our own kubernetes cluster which i can

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,000
very well imagine

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,399
um then i think like using some kind of

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
managed provider is the answer for for

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,800
that

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,040
part of the question and then yes

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,360
obviously it should be

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,880
ideally fairly easy to on top of that

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,920
kubernetes cluster then

00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,959
kind of enable a pass experience based

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,959
on on cloudform

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,839
my initial reaction

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,680
yeah i i think that makes sense to me i

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,200
mean um

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,839
to a certain extent i i um

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,240
view those like rami mentioned that

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,279
there's

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
you know they've been the rise of

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,079
managed kubernetes offerings on the one

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
hand

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,519
and then these paz offerings on the

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
other hand i mean i i kind of

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
view those as solving some of those

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
management but at slightly different

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,279
layers

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,519
where that even with a managed

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,200
kubernetes you're ultimately

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,760
presenting as the interface for that

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,800
system the kubernetes apis

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,120
and so the management part of that is

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
is really more addressing the actual

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,360
operation of the

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,519
kubernetes cluster itself as

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,959
infrastructure and it's not doing

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,199
anything intrinsically to

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,160
provide a higher level experience for

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,279
developers

00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,800
or other users of that cluster and

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,839
so um you know up until now

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,279
if you've wanted something like that

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,680
you've had to go do a totally separate

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,160
pass like cloud foundry on vms or heroku

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
or

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,279
you know some of the google offerings or

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,720
something like that and

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,199
i think that that is a lot of the

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,279
opportunity that we see with taking that

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,399
uh cf experience technology onto

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,399
kubernetes

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,880
is that you know we're getting them to

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,680
combine those infrastructure layers

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:31,839
having it be less of an either or choice

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,839
for those end users

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,360
so how follow-up question um

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,720
would be often times would be

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,160
um we sort of understand how this can

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,079
bring benefits to like

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,519
big teams in sort of enterprise grid

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,959
organizations where

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,600
even like a small

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,399
percentage boost in efficiency for a

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,079
single team

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,399
you know gets multiplied across the

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,440
organization and that results in like

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,440
a lot of saving and

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,800
in terms of you know benefit

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:25,600
for a smaller team is it

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,760
only in terms of convenience um

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,519
or he said like uh is that like

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,519
something we can look forward to a year

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,360
from now is that something

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,279
you know you can you can promise them

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,160
say six months from now so

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,720
um any thoughts or ideas that folks have

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,160
about

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,959
you know what are

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,600
these short-term and long-term benefits

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,880
of

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,240
taking this approach of take cloud-found

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,639
repairs

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,120
avail it on a managed communities

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,680
offering that you are

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,480
that that you are going to use and you

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,600
know just

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,040
just be cute first

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:09,839
uh for your product or for your

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,839
web service from the beginning

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,720
i guess many many of the conversations

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,759
that

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,240
like i i have these days are actually

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,720
talking people through like what are the

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,279
differences when it comes to

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,199
doing the bare naked kubernetes workflow

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,360
of developing a stateless workload

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,320
versus what do you actually

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,120
do and get if you're using cloud foundry

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,320
on top

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,360
ultimately and then actually

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,920
like probably we could do a much better

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,720
job in

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,639
in kind of explaining those benefits for

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,600
a kubernetes user

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:53,920
like obviously everybody puts together

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,920
our own material around that topic but

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,000
when i think about it i'm not sure that

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,880
we've kind of

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
nicely articulated that that difference

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,880
in in like

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,679
a crisp overview of any any sorts and

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,199
that

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
like starts with a couple of things

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,640
right like you would typically say you

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,720
have cf push which

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,720
kind of turns your container into a

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,439
running application but then

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,079
uh you actually have have much more like

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,880
um

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,679
default security settings that that are

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,600
saying

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,160
you have like the whole topic of how do

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,720
you get an ingress and how do you get

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,440
or how do you make sure that http

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,320
requests

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,320
reach your application and so on and so

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,120
forth so if you dig through that

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,520
whole thing roles that are kind of

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,960
predefined that makes sense for people

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,679
um then at least with

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,160
small teams granted those small teams

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
don't

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,760
run cf kates for themselves but they

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,480
also expect that

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,559
to to be a managed offering but small

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,240
teams oftentimes say

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,240
but i want to focus on actually

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
developing my business logic as opposed

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,280
to

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,240
kind of looking into low-level

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,880
kubernetes

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,400
concepts and kind of understanding them

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,039
and managing them

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,120
on our own that's at least like

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,120
conversations that that i have

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,720
quite frequently these days

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,400
yeah i mean i i think that that

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,679
fundamental value proposition

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,880
for app developers still remains

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,000
and um you know we've we've seen

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,880
validation of that in the form of

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,760
um some of the hosted cf offerings that

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
have existed

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,919
so you know there's been pdubs um

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,520
uh ibm public cf instance is still

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,280
another example where you know that's

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,400
that's largely multi-tenant and it's

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,760
just presenting that developer

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,840
experience they don't have any of those

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,400
operational concerns

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,240
um and so i think

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,840
even even right now that's still a

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,760
benefit that we can present

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,039
um uh maybe it's

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,520
it's a little bit um

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,400
less of a jump from very kubernetes up

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,320
to

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
the cf level abstract of abstraction

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,039
than it was from say

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,760
starting with vms and you know amis and

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,559
and just

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,080
virtual machine images um and having to

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,120
generate all of that stuff yourself as a

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,200
developer

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,120
um but i you know i i think that that's

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,039
still going to be attractive to a

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,320
certain segment of developers that are

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,919
just like okay i want to

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,440
you know i just want to get this stuff

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,640
working i care about

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,799
um uh writing

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,000
code in my language that i'm developing

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,120
and not having to deal with all these

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,160
infrastructure details

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,720
it's not going to appeal to everyone

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,400
right some people want to be able to go

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,440
down and tinker with the system

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,600
and so yeah i think that yeah

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
that that near term benefit is really

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,320
the making that infrastructure more

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,000
accessible with things like cf for kids

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,440
i rang it on top of kubernetes which is

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,080
more available yeah go ahead go ahead

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,960
rob

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,640
sorry i'm just going to pick on uh

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,679
multi-tenancy because you

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,679
mentioned it because again it's

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,400
it's not so much as you know small teams

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,640
inside a startup that

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,520
um that interact with us but there's

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,080
also this

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:20,720
um agency persona who sort of

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,400
come and go from time to time but

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,280
there's like a lot of folks who are

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,640
managing multiple apps for like multiple

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,360
clients and then

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,400
um cfocates is a good proposition for

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,200
them because

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,000
um you know two of their clients are

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,600
working with like

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,440
a drupal website and they have some

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,440
go apps running and they have something

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
else and um

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,039
there's the agency persona who's

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,880
managing like

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,480
two or three different application

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,640
stacks and

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,840
you know build backs plus cfo gates is

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,600
like a

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,480
huge uh win for them on paper

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,640
uh but they're also worried about um you

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,240
know what's

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,520
is this is cfr gates truly uh

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,320
multi-tenant ready is it on

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,440
i mean um so even hypothetically

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,480
speaking they would say

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,480
um cf for vms uh was

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,520
we know it had like very robust

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,000
multi-tenancy

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,400
ac for kids on par with that what's like

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,440
the multi-tenancy capability of cf4k

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,440
so um

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,240
what is uh what is the current state of

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
that if you don't mind me asking sorry

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,360
for the

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,159
digression but um i just wanted to pick

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
on that because

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,200
it's a question that we've had in the

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,679
past and we've

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,559
i've given a very i've given a poor

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,559
answer let's say

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,640
i'm interested in sort of uh details

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,600
about that

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,400
yeah rob do you know if they're um

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,600
they're concerned

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,600
primarily about multi-tenancy from

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,360
kind of the the api perspective the

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,640
public interfaces

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,679
that the system is providing or

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:07,120
if that's more about things at

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,120
the container behavior layer

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,480
[Music]

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,159
um

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,720
so if my interaction with the two three

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,559
folks that

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,840
asked me this question is more in terms

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,919
of i have

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,400
three clients that i want to manage and

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,320
can i so multi-tenancy on bare bones

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,400
kubernetes or any managed kubernetes

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,960
provider is

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,960
is going to be very hard for me um so

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,799
i've not bothered making the migration

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,600
to kubernetes

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,400
and i've sort of stayed with you know

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
whatever

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,159
deployment to vms that i have or

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,760
platform.sh or

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,919
some of these other services that are

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,960
available um

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,320
so that's that's the

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,840
extent to which the discussion has been

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,600
so i'm not very sure if it's from the

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,799
api perspective or the container

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,159
behavior

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,919
but it's more in terms of what they

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,960
would experience overall

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:12,880
so i'm not very sure

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,559
about which is which

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,200
yeah sure i think from from the um

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,360
perspective of the especially the the

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,150
developer or administrator facing apis

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,640
because

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,679
[Music]

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,280
because cf4caps has carried over that

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,440
cloud controller component that's

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,280
presenting those

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,559
those are still basically the same like

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,840
you certainly still have the oregon

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,000
space separation

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:45,520
within that data model um so

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,520
you know i i wouldn't

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,039
see a lot of concerns there although i

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,400
don't know that we've done like the most

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,200
careful audit of

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,720
of all of those um to to make sure that

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,360
that's the case

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,840
um i think that there are some potential

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,720
gaps

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,360
between say diego and garden on cf or

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,279
vms

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:09,120
deployment and maybe what you might

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,480
um be able to have configured on a

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,240
kubernetes cluster

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,240
i believe that the garden and irene

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,679
teams um

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,600
did a pass some time ago over some of

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,559
those security differences

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,320
which would be i would view as the main

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,080
concerns around multi-tenancy like

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,440
that and potentially resource usage

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,200
within the cluster

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,760
or you know having noisy neighbors um

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,200
i don't have the link off hand but

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,640
that's probably something we could dick

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,960
up offline

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,960
as well

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,840
oh yeah baron if you have a if you have

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,840
something authentication

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
kicking

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,039
so in in general there is this uh kind

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,960
of known

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:07,039
incompatibilities document and we've

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,120
sent over the

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,480
mailing list some time back and i

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,799
believe somewhere

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:29,840
in there

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:29,840
security if i'm mistaken

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,600
and then there's another one kind of

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,159
comparing

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:43,120
irene with diego in more general terms

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,799
so i'll leave these should be the

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,320
resources and i hope that they are

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,480
kind of still fairly up-to-date awesome

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,960
thank you i'll definitely take a look

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,960
after

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
welcome

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,799
so so ram what's what what's like the

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,159
the general feedback of of people that

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,120
that you are talking to

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,320
to kind of bringing cloud foundry on

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,559
kubernetes beyond

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,559
like the the questions that you've asked

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,159
generally the few people that i've

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,760
spoken to have been

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,110
very excited by the possibilities um

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,880
particularly

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,760
[Music]

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,200
because of the fact that they all like

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,640
love and worship heroku

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,880
until the point that they see their

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,400
pricing pages

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,200
and the fact that um

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,520
i mean hopefully there's uh nobody from

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,919
her book here would take offense but

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,039
uh that's that's you know sort of been

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,520
uh

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,600
a common place where people's eyes have

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,640
lit up oh this is open source oh this is

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,200
so much like

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,039
oh this works on kubernetes it's sort of

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,480
everything that i've asked for

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,520
and then um the combination

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,799
of you know potato bit bags and cf

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,240
arcades and

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,240
um you know support and for for all of

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,880
these different runtimes and frameworks

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,080
is

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,360
uh is great um

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,360
there's always you know a lot of

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,320
questions about okay beyond the hello

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,720
world uh

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,080
would it work for a particular you know

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,840
php

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:32,080
uh fbm mod whatever combination

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,559
and different like go uh

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,240
applications and things like that and

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,240
people are very excited about the

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,840
possibilities especially

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,679
in comparison to um other past systems

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,720
that are available

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,399
now incidentally the the past

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,960
six months to a year has seen so many

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,320
other

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:58,880
folks come out with buildbacks based

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:02,240
pass offerings that also do like

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,840
deployments to kubernetes and generally

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,159
container based deployments which is

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,159
again

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,720
you know a great sort of starter in

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,720
terms of hey if you heard about this

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,640
cool new tool that made front page of

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,720
hacker news today

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,559
it also makes use of bit bags and you

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,360
know we've been advocating bit banks

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,720
uh for use with cloud foundry and um

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,919
stuff like that so

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,320
um there's a there's a lot happening

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,760
in the general infrastructure and past

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,159
days that

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,919
you're slightly ahead of the curve off

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,200
and and that makes for very

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,520
interesting conversations as well

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,120
and then i think you know overall

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,520
there's

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:49,039
a very few uh tools and

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:52,720
techniques that we are incompatible with

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,720
so to say so like if you're using

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,240
some travis let's say to do a lot of

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,640
your deployment this you know ci works

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,760
perfectly fine with travis you just make

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,000
use of

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,600
some plugins and other things that they

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,520
have and

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,200
you can do ocf deployments and a lot of

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,200
those things

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,200
we've been able to uncover in the past

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,720
few months share it with the community

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,080
and

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,960
all of these have been uh very welcome

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,960
in general so

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,559
it's definitely a lot of you know

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,840
positive conversations and good

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,039
takeaways

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,919
so far in in whatever engagement that

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,919
we've had so far

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,000
and it it sounds like when you say like

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,159
people

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,120
coming with a heroku background then

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,039
these were not

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:52,240
like pure kubernetes users but rather

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:54,480
like so what what kind of scenarios

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,919
did these people build so far on on

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,159
heroku for example

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,159
um

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,960
i think a lot of them have been using

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,760
heroku for

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,559
side projects stuff that they've tested

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,279
and staged

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,200
and things like that but then when it

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,799
had to go to production or go live they

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,200
decided to

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,200
get off of heroku and do it on their own

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,240
infrastructure

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,640
so that was the case with two of

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,000
uh the folks that i had spoken to that i

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,080
clearly remember and

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,440
there's probably like few others that

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,840
are deploying

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,039
to heroku um all of their production

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,240
apps i

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,159
i'm not sure but like at least the

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,000
two folks that showed me some of their

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,120
uh

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,159
sort of landscape had heroku for staging

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,799
but then

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,840
uh did like vms for production and

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,840
things like that

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,080
okay and rob did you

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,240
uh i think you mentioned a couple

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,760
different factors there

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,960
did you get the impression that that was

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,880
mostly about that control of

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,880
infrastructure or was that about cost

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,060
they gave me the impression of it being

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,270
mostly cost

00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,270
[Music]

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:21,760
but you know i can't be too sure i

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,760
didn't want to take too much into it

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,840
but the

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,399
the ability to run on kubernetes and

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,559
have that

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:41,519
transparent stuff is is very interesting

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,000
to uh folks so few people just mentioned

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,120
that

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,120
you know it's it's great

00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:02,159
[Music]

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,200
that they

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,360
they were they were

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,360
capable of deploying to kubernetes or

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,000
they were making an active shift or an

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,640
effort to also

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,720
have kubernetes as an option for for

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,279
deployment and things like that so

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,080
that presented like a very interesting

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:29,840
uh prospect for

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:29,840
for the the prospective cfo gates users

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,399
