here we go recording so welcome to

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:11,130
today's instance of the Cloud Foundry

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:17,070
for kubernetes everybody is calling in

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:19,080
from home meeting welcome to today's

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,050
instance just browsing through the

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,590
channel to see the latest votes I would

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,269
say unfortunately this time we kind of

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,510
have the leftover topics that we

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,059
couldn't touch upon for like the last

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,020
instances of this meeting and as

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,460
indicated in in the chat

00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,670
having jewels on the cob would have been

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,750
good also to see some signs of life from

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,989
Great Britain but yeah that's so he

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,420
probably or maybe he still joining other

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,149
than that I guess one one topic for this

00:00:51,420 --> 00:01:00,829
round would be let's say assuming that

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:03,750
we kind of don't have too many kind of

00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:05,670
standards topics is there anything that

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,640
we should do to like the frequency of

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,549
the meeting or should we kind of move to

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,070
a more regular agenda with like teams

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,520
working on various topics just providing

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,960
updates I think I would be probably a

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,900
discussion beyond the topic that I think

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:30,299
has won the poll with like three votes

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:33,420
out of a total of four votes provided

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,460
which is what are we doing next slash

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,110
now that we should

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,150
what are we not sorry what are we not

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,430
doing next session our that we should be

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:46,590
doing next question provided by Jules as

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:56,390
I said and for chuckling this is not on

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:57,830
this call so any any idea

00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,720
on that particular question and then we

00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,479
should come back to like the overall

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:06,460
question in terms of cadence or changing

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,460
the structure of the meeting slightly

00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,770
manfully else has a trike I'm still

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,959
waiting for Jules to do I should have

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:22,220
should have voted I'm still waiting for

00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:24,739
Jules to do a demo I want to see all

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,260
right I mean he was arguing saying it's

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:29,390
no longer and I really 1.0 demo and I

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,060
would agree probably it's a 1 point

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,770
something they mark meanwhile but they

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,320
are getting an update where they are

00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,269
headed it's probably a good thing to

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,190
have but especially for this topic we

00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:48,470
wouldn't need Jules in the column right

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:49,850
yeah otherwise how do you do that last I

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:56,269
understood they were targeting

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:58,220
additional V 3 V 3 support things like

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:01,340
rolling deployers and tasks and things

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:04,430
like that right so so rudely employes

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,260
was something that we kind of voted for

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,660
because that's something that people use

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:14,329
on our and already on and obviously like

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,209
the whole the whole discussion ties into

00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:19,640
like feature comparisons less feature

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,920
parity where I thinks I mentioned that

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,430
like this is also something thats that's

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,160
upcoming to identify at least where the

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,750
gaps are yeah when you mention tasks I I

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:36,790
kind of was hoping that was already

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:36,790
supported by the the current API No

00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:47,379
as far as I know I brought it up a few

00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:50,560
times like where the remaining gaps with

00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:54,489
with them and I admit I've mentioned

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:59,430
tasks and Jules hasn't said no that's

00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:02,950
already done so I think it's tracker

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:06,120
yeah I promise tobacco o'clock as well

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:17,350
recently and saw some stories about that

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:20,720
okay that's one thing I hadn't tested as

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,420
for changing the the format

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,280
I think we just need to be a little bit

00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,260
more active about suggesting new topics

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,390
because now we've we've we've whittled

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,460
it down to the two that we we either

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,160
don't get to or we don't close you know

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,830
we've talked about option one before

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,270
what are we not doing next now and I

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:44,620
would love to change the wording of that

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:50,690
what should we be doing its citizens and

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:52,430
so I to that to that end I did post this

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,490
blog post which got a lot of traction

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,190
thanks to the foundation which I sort of

00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:02,000
unilaterally said what we're doing as a

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,800
community because I wanted of course to

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,800
present a very united front and we have

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,960
F and brocades moving in the same

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,360
direction and broadly that's true it

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,820
wasn't always true like we had you know

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:20,240
a couple of sick meetings ago it was

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:23,690
actually kind of contentious so first of

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,970
all has anyone read that and objected to

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,830
anything in there because I I just wrote

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,800
it I didn't sort of consult with too

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,270
many people I ran part of it by sy to

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,640
say is this okay with you what I'm

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,680
saying about SIA for K eights

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,030
but I just kind of barged ahead and did

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:44,870
that any any feedback from that and or

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:47,840
any anything we need to talk about from

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,940
the has there been more inquiries

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:59,810
because of that post in the press press

00:05:49,940 --> 00:06:06,500
release a to be honest I haven't read it

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:08,150
tries out last week okay three today

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,070
they said unfortunately it's not

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,530
required reading or anything I just I

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,910
just want to check cross-check what I've

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:19,460
written with you guys which is basically

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:22,430
you know Cube CF is awesome but if you

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,280
so this is my outstanding action item

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,190
from the last cig meeting which is

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,320
disambiguate CF 4k eights and cube CF I

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,750
had an initial conversation with the

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,789
docs team but I haven't followed up on

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,250
that so the plan was to do a blog post

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,750
first to just sort of say this this is

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,780
the keep CF project because it was going

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:46,760
into incubation terrible time to use

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:48,950
that word in a blog post and here's if

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,070
you're wondering here's CF 4 KS which is

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,960
the kubernetes idiomatic components

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,750
which are being integrated together in

00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,140
this repository and this is what the two

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,919
of them do so so we'll I'll pick up the

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,419
doc thing again and and I've made a

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,770
contact with someone on that team that

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:14,020
was okay with me exploring that further

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,020
but I haven't done that yet just just

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,440
yeah as a quick glance over it looks

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,509
fine to me

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,930
thank thanks for putting that to you

00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:38,150
later cheers doc so next and they will

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:43,520
be important I think yeah I appreciate

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:45,430
you doing that right if there are fair

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,910
shy of topics I can give a quick update

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:53,930
yes please yeah awesome so we are

00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:57,770
planning to lease 0.1 release of C it

00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,650
for Kate's we're hoping to do this this

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,150
week there's some small document

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,190
documentation updates we want to make

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,220
before we we actually cut that release

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:12,020
so that should be out and at this week

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:14,539
or early like Monday or Tuesday and get

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,949
this here push with Bill packs and it

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,270
contains all the highlights and on

00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:21,110
issues in the release note so you'll get

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:25,340
to know what you can or cannot do so

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:28,010
that's that's coming up leave what's

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,849
next for us is we are now focusing on

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:35,089
the contribution workflow so how do we

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:38,479
consume releases from contributing

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:41,120
projects as we do with CFD today alright

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,820
nice bits body we want to try to

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,709
automate that as much as possible and

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,320
create that sort of contract between us

00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:51,380
and the contributing teams so that's

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,300
that's in Prague progress and we plan to

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,209
submit the proposal to you see updating

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,580
the dev mailing list to get feedback

00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:00,470
from the community right now it's going

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:05,870
to circulation within the team at the

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:07,250
moment so pretty excited about that yeah

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,380
and the other were other part is we're

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,350
also looking at the compatibility matrix

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,209
of what Kate's versions as you all know

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:18,020
K cube annuities community version

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:23,300
supports up to three versions and they

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:25,790
have a pretty what we call the cadence

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,600
for releasing every quarterly so it's

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:31,769
pretty the pace is pretty high so and

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,449
every minor releases

00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:35,129
minor major release so every every

00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:37,559
quarter of the release they have some

00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:40,050
breaking changes in the API so how do we

00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,059
how do we maintain that what kind of

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,339
support can we give to the community so

00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,050
that's also under discussion so a lot of

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:50,279
things going on you know a lot of

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:52,639
threads and good amount of activity so

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,639
that's good

00:09:56,749 --> 00:10:02,399
any question

00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:05,279
so when you say contribution workflow

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,410
that would also mean like putting a

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,910
focus on making sure that when a

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:13,769
component team releases and you're like

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,110
readily available to to take up that new

00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:19,519
version relatively quickly right that's

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,869
true that's right yeah

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,869
and then also configuration how do we

00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:28,379
consume that as well you know if there

00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:32,459
are any configuration changes so yeah a

00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:35,879
lot of a lot of good work around that a

00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:39,629
lot of brains at work that's all I had I

00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:42,029
mean I have a PMC meeting today so I'm

00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:45,889
gonna probably provide a bit more detail

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,889
than not to so although welcome to join

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:58,060
my calendar has stopped updating when

00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:03,140
it's at PMC meeting and I know that's

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:06,680
10:30 Pacific today okay

00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:10,520
I'll try and join just to listen to nip

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:14,690
dates I found it really helpful actually

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:18,170
being part of those and I'll remind Vlad

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:22,640
that he's on deck for updates that's a

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:29,050
new thing for us what time would that be

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:34,050
a local time for him he doesn't sleep

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:37,300
fine what's the cause and effect their

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:39,650
[Laughter]

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,910
boundless energy I've always identified

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:44,450
you guys

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:48,650
so 10:30 Pacific so an hour and half

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:52,690
from now about 8:30 probably it could be

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,690
p.m. yeah that sounds about right

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,070
okay nobody else has an additional topic

00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,350
then probably wanted to pick up on

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,480
something that was at least briefly

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,240
mentioned in some of the calls but then

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,420
I think I keep hearing the topic every

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,320
now and then which is like migration so

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,930
kind of moving stuff from one cloud

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,850
foundry to another one and then like

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,740
obviously there could be variations in

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,560
terms of what that other Cloud Foundry

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,380
actually is so obviously like moving

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,900
from a posh jcf to ku 180 space one is

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,670
this one use case but I guess on our end

00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,850
we even have use cases where we want to

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:47,750
move workloads from one wash face tf2 to

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:50,660
another one so wanted to let's say see

00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:53,150
if there's like common interest in in

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,060
the topic and then obviously like from

00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:59,390
from ours perspective you have a couple

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,730
of angles to to look at that like what

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,270
kind of migration do you provides the to

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,640
you

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,740
like even consider backing service

00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,220
content in that migration or is that

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:14,060
something that you keep out of scope do

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:17,210
you quote unquote just like migrate over

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,390
like org structure socio forks and

00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:22,580
spaces and user assignments and do you

00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:24,890
then because like people will anyhow

00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,740
need to change their endpoints kind of

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:29,690
ask them to reach their applications or

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:34,370
is that something that you would migrate

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:37,430
over so I think those those are topics

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,440
that are are of interest to to us not

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,480
that we've really spent implementation

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,280
effort on it but it comes up every now

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:48,950
and then to be clear and because this is

00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,780
a you know I'm sure we've all heard

00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:55,460
stories like this before but there's a

00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:58,370
very wide range so you're not talking

00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,910
about generic backup/restore but you're

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:05,660
talking about migration where you should

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:09,430
expect a variant level of service or

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:12,590
configuration between the two systems

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:14,390
well ultimately yes I mean backup and

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,670
restore in my mind would mean like

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,160
backing up an entire Cloud Foundry

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:22,220
system and kind of restoring it in place

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,470
so to speak so I think when I when I say

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,350
migration as I said I would at least

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,690
expect the the endpoint of that Cloud

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:33,200
Foundry system changes and then like

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:37,160
depending on how sophisticated you you

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:40,040
want to be you might have different

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,540
levels of migration and that might speak

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,490
and some some support to move over

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,830
things like user assignments but it

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,010
might also be requirements around like

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:54,920
what would we need to do in order to

00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:56,990
let's say move a customer or tenant that

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,390
actually doesn't want to move right so I

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:03,140
think that's like the ultimate scenario

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:05,660
where like the need to move more comes

00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,150
from us as a platform provider so for

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,660
example Cloud Foundry deployments

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:14,210
growing too big might be a use case but

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,160
then even things that that's I mentioned

00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,830
where like for exam

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,990
there's a question of when it is version

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,540
updates and then do you wanna like in

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,660
place update your kubernetes cluster or

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,180
do you also need to have like some

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,040
migration tooling to actually seamlessly

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,750
move over workloads from from one

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,940
deployment to another one so it's

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,490
actually a very broad range and like I

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,740
don't think that we've settled on one

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:45,080
concept or one end of the spectrum

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:47,120
already but just so in the I mean

00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,630
there's there's the Bosch backup/restore

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:54,680
which could be updated for a kubernetes

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:57,890
world there's also the one that dr. max

00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:05,000
sent the next incubation request from us

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:07,700
is the the Cloud Foundry plugin for

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,430
backup and restore at the Cloud Foundry

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:17,120
command level which is designed and and

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,400
has successfully been used in the last

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,720
case you're talking about where a

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:27,590
customer is either moving Hardware

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:32,660
they're moving the same similar system

00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:35,420
to the two new hardware or a new

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:38,540
kubernetes installation but in effect

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,870
it's it's the same user set org set and

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:46,010
that's that tool which does actually

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,690
have some options it the data services

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,060
you have to handle yourself although

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,220
there's a easily prescribed way you can

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,070
do that depending on the service um and

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,660
Jeff some updates there so I've actually

00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,270
back-channel with Vlad who's in another

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,900
call we're in the process of moving that

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:04,910
plugin into the foundation iBM has

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:09,290
expressed interest in collaborating on

00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:15,650
it so it's an API based backup and

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:17,209
restore and we're going to be adding

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,600
some things to it which are missing

00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,490
right now I pace re I can't paste in

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,640
there in the zoom meeting but it's in

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,540
this yet 4k eights channel I just pasted

00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,540
the link there

00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:35,450
so we planning to add services migration

00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:41,509
or serve as binding migration and you a

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:43,249
a deets as well so using the API rather

00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:45,259
than getting into the database export

00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:47,899
I'm not exactly sure how all the magics

00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:51,710
gonna work and Vlad has to get that the

00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:54,259
details of that but they have something

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,600
in the works and are gonna be looking

00:17:54,259 --> 00:18:00,759
for collaboration on that plugin once

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,759
it's once it's upstream

00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:08,610
that would be in the extensions PMC yeah

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:12,269
so that's targeting again the last case

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:16,379
from a service vendor or a service

00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:21,029
provider point of view it doesn't target

00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:25,970
as much cherry picking like one group

00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:31,529
out of out of ten or something like that

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:35,100
but so that one of the areas yeah but

00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:39,269
that's another feature that they want to

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:43,320
implement which orgs apps or spaces to

00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:52,710
migrate so that you could cherry-pick

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:57,330
essentially yeah I'd say like VMware we

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:59,970
don't have active investment and it's

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,190
just yet as we were mostly focused on

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:06,779
investing and making a solid place to

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:11,490
land but it's an area of interest for us

00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:16,559
and our in talking with some of our

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:19,200
customers I think they're they're

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,779
thinking that they're much more

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,820
interested in how could they do this in

00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:29,610
a deliberate slow fashion bring it they

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:34,350
there's not I think the idea of a big

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:38,220
bang migration is very scary and hard to

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:40,919
get right that there was there was one

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,379
customer who was saying what we have so

00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:48,619
many surrounding things on top of Cloud

00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:51,059
Foundry but for for a vendor or

00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:54,139
contributor to two CF to imagine you

00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:56,549
could build like a perfect migrator tool

00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:59,399
you know there might be pieces that

00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:01,590
might be helpful for that but but we

00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,330
couldn't really manage a whole big bang

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,919
for them because of just what they built

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:09,590
up around it and and I think that makes

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,730
a lot of sense when you think about the

00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:16,049
capabilities or going to be a little bit

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,690
different you kind of want to be able to

00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:22,690
say okay

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:25,779
maybe this portion of apps that are are

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,720
ready to go and we can start getting

00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:31,450
runway on those and so maybe that's like

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,269
the smaller chart targeted things you

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,489
were discussing Troy yeah I think that's

00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:38,109
we've we've heard that as well and it

00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:39,789
depends on the customer entirely some

00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:41,769
people want to do an in-place upgrade

00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:45,759
with no additional hardware which is an

00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:47,499
extremely hard thing to to manage other

00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,139
people are like no I would never try

00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:53,919
that I'm you know set up any completely

00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:57,879
duplicate a residual that residual a

00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:02,830
parallel CF and then move things over in

00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:05,109
my own time so yeah I I get that and I

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:07,690
think that's the idea with the V API

00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:12,039
based plugin that it just provides some

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:14,679
functionality to pull down I mean right

00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,359
now and just pull down everything from

00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,190
the organization and and then you can

00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:21,639
restore I can't remember it's been years

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:24,999
since I've used this thing I think

00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:27,429
there's a there's a similar tool that

00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:29,799
some of the pivotal and VMware

00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,779
professional services folks have written

00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:35,229
called CF management that's mostly

00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:37,330
focused on propagating or backing up and

00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:41,349
restoring that organizational structure

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:54,009
I'll drop a link into the CF orchids

00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:55,869
channel to that yeah and I think that's

00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:59,229
more I kind of from the from the

00:21:55,869 --> 00:22:00,940
outside-in came declaratively like these

00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:05,590
are kind of the orgs and users and we'd

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:09,220
like to step it out to to a number of

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:11,679
foundations because our installations of

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:15,279
Cloud Foundry because they're already

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,590
you know with the hardware lifecycle

00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:23,289
every few years having to build new

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:25,989
foundations and whatnot and then trying

00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:28,479
to replicate more or less there or user

00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:30,389
structure and telling people okay these

00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:34,750
really your new endpoints these are

00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:45,850
new domains and please manage your

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:48,789
migration over so it sounds like mostly

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:52,750
people are saying backing services data

00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:55,210
services those would need to be migrated

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:58,990
separately is that how generally people

00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,789
are coaching yeah I don't know if we

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:05,379
have good out of the box

00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:07,090
generic solutions for those yet you know

00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:09,279
it might be worth us trying to be a

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,110
little more specific around the kinds of

00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,789
migrations that we might be trying to

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,220
support you know because I can see a

00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:17,409
difference between migrating 1cf

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,179
instance and those backing services from

00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:20,980
like a network in one geographic

00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:24,909
location to a totally other geographic

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,440
location versus doing one that's more

00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:28,570
local because you're trying to do like a

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,500
switch from a Bosch based distro to a

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:35,460
gates based one you know we had a

00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:39,460
particular we had a migration like this

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:43,929
when we we had a customer go from

00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:49,210
staccato to cap and it was difficult for

00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:50,710
us to move the service bindings because

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:55,809
actually the database was staying in the

00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:57,759
same place in their data center and the

00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:01,990
the binding had to move but then the

00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:04,000
broker what was the problem the broker

00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:07,809
didn't know about the fact that it was

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,210
also moving I can't remember no cuz we

00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:12,549
got it out of the CCTV we ended up going

00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,620
in and doing surgery and the CCD be damn

00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:16,330
it to make it all fit but it would have

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,429
been really nice if the plugin could

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,379
have handled that somehow and there was

00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:22,539
something that would have been nice in

00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:24,250
the API I think to make the migration

00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:26,529
happen and I'd have that's glad about

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,870
that as well all thinking about well I'm

00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:31,629
guessing it might be that like if use

00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:34,149
solely gold wire the API he would need

00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:36,909
to do a CF create instance right and

00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:39,129
that my like create something different

00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:42,039
than what the source system actually

00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:44,039
understood that's right we would have to

00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,889
create instance with

00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:49,289
same IDs like we would have to recreate

00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:54,029
instance essentially rather than get a

00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:54,869
new binding that's why we couldn't do it

00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:58,950
with the API

00:24:54,869 --> 00:25:00,539
anyway we we had the requirement in

00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,070
there somewhere so once this goes up

00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:04,379
streamed up the plugin goes upstream we

00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:07,739
could it make more sense to have the

00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:18,749
corresponding feature request for the

00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:20,729
API submitted as well it really needs

00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:23,519
like some concentrated effort to like

00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:25,409
kind of think about all of these

00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,820
scenarios trying to be transparent about

00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:32,940
like what's being worked on at all if

00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:36,889
nothing and how to advocate for

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:41,399
attention to the different scenarios and

00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:44,009
and curious burned if you if you have

00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:49,259
folks who who are concentrating in this

00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:51,210
area as I said not not yet fully but we

00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,519
see that topic as is definitely

00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:56,159
something that that will come up I'm

00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,869
kind of tempted even though kind of

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,239
looking at my schedule I I won't be able

00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:02,399
to really come up with with something

00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:05,220
short term but I'm tempted to to kind of

00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:07,440
put something together in terms of these

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,059
scenarios and thoughts and ideas and

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,340
probably also like the links to the

00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:17,700
ruling that exists today and then

00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,639
probably circulated in this round to to

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,169
get some people again many thoughts but

00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:24,450
no promises on let's say having that in

00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:36,389
the next two weeks or so but I'll like

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:39,799
to try and put something in each each of

00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:44,389
us I thought it was good seeing everyone

00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:44,389
thank you what do you next time

00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:53,079
so I guess as we don't have let's say

00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:55,659
too many topics coming up this side so

00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:57,999
probably let's let's switch over to like

00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:59,949
the the other part so Troy you said like

00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:03,849
we should be more proactive in putting

00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:06,099
in in topic so other than my reminders

00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:09,309
which I guess I mean while drowning in

00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:12,819
other discussion related to to see what

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:16,779
else could we do to kind of incentivize

00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:19,029
people to either proactively like

00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:22,709
present topics or at least bring up

00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:31,359
topics that that we could discuss about

00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:32,589
what do I think we should do yeah how do

00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:44,379
we make the meeting shorter and more

00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:46,809
social no I mean I'm always tempted to

00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:49,749
send some more nagging reminders to

00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:52,659
people to fill out the poll not sure if

00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:55,809
that is to appreciate that then also I

00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:58,569
don't know it's like this adhere thing

00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:02,139
works in in like the slack Channel and

00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:10,089
then that might probably not yeah that

00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:11,919
might backfire on you yeah I see I see

00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:15,819
the same problems around like it it's

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,069
kind of hard to get people to think

00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:24,159
about that in advance that I have a good

00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:27,069
solution one one option we could do is

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,279
we we Wallen told in the sense that we

00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:32,619
have a set of topics that we want to

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,659
discuss and then write the finer

00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:36,699
individual who may be leaving that

00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:39,699
project or knows what about it and then

00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:42,969
give them at least a week or two advance

00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:44,469
that we want to talk about this so that

00:28:42,969 --> 00:28:48,129
way the agenda at leas is planned out

00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:53,109
for two weeks three weeks out instead of

00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:54,699
asking people I want to talk about it so

00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:56,529
that would probably also involve

00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:58,929
creating something like a document where

00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:59,590
people could just like put put in those

00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:02,799
those

00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,840
in items as opposed to having them like

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,720
distributed all across the select

00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:11,169
channel in those yeah we're just gonna

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,510
say super close right yeah as this group

00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,190
we can seed it like we can just do a

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,650
dumping sort of topics we want to

00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:20,140
discuss that that could help each other

00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,419
projects or other projects on top of

00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:25,330
their minds and then and then we find

00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:27,309
the right person who could help us deep

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,370
dive into that or we just could just be

00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:32,860
an open discussion like I think we

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,899
should cede some topics and then and

00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,789
then we just say here this Tuesday we're

00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:38,309
gonna talk about this and then next

00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:40,720
Tuesday we're gonna talk about this

00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:43,750
that's a different approach than what

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:48,340
you have today is requesting for topics

00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:51,100
and voting on them yeah make sense so

00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,200
I'll take another action and come up

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,929
with such a collection document will

00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:00,520
probably send it to to the select

00:29:55,929 --> 00:30:03,820
channel plus probably by a mail to to

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,730
this round of people here and then ask

00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,529
everybody to come up with their topic

00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,970
suggestions and then plan a little bit

00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:14,740
upfront on what's going to be presented

00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:17,500
I'll make up my mind on like the mode on

00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,450
on how we do that yeah probably one one

00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,149
week in advance kind of closing the poll

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:25,210
already and then letting the name people

00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:28,149
know that they are actually up for our

00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:34,870
presentation double-checking if they're

00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:37,929
actually available and yeah I think it

00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:40,120
is I think it is worth evaluating well

00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:43,840
really want the cadence of this meeting

00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,789
to be if if it's not redundant with

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,440
other things I mean because we've moved

00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:49,090
a lot of the activity into the runtime

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,200
PMC and so I think some of those

00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,820
discussions are naturally going to

00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,210
happen there of course you know

00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,980
everyone's welcome to join those two and

00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,870
then we also have the cap call on a

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:03,370
monthly cadence for some of those other

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:06,490
things so I think we should maybe plan

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,809
to have the one in two weeks but maybe

00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,730
that could be a just like meta

00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:11,289
discussion topic is what do we want to

00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,539
do in the future with this meeting do we

00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:19,889
want to shorten it make it less frequent

00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:19,889
we try that out make sense cool

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,850
I've got a clock are you

00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:29,739
yeah so I think we can close for now

00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:32,350
thanks everybody for joining in and then

00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:36,239
thank you thank you all right thanks all

00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,239
