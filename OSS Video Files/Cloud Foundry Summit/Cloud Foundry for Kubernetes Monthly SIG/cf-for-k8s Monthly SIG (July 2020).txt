you

00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:23,099
hey Troy good morning that good good

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:30,210
good afternoon I'm wondering if I should

00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:33,120
get my laptop so I can share screen you

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:37,070
could be social I'm gonna leave and come

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,070
back with a camera

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,060
you

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,310
you

00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,620
you

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,330

00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,560
hello young hello

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,250
oh I think recording has already started

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,700
interesting

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:38,940
I'm guessing there's a way to cut out

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:43,369
the pre-show before actually publishing

00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,369
stuff but I'm not interrogation

00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:00,810
so when running I'm actually listening

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:05,009
to a podcast called ATP accidental tech

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:10,890
podcast not true know it like from the

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:13,380
MEC space like people who are into make

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:17,430
development mega technology the Tri

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:21,230
cetera and they have like a pre-show and

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,940
a post show hey Troy I have hi Troy hey

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,880
Vlad is joining for sure I think Jeff as

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,890
well sounds good I was just mentioning

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,470
to young that apparently recording has

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,480
already been triggered I noticed that

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,100
when I actually popped in earlier and I

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,079
noticed that recording automatically I

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:43,610
went on I mean okay yeah just to be good

00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,610
to be aware yeah

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:59,850
you guys well yeah so far still keeping

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:02,190
healthy fortunately our numbers are

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,600
pretty good in British Columbia so I'm

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,600
starting to ease things up a little

00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:31,920
so sighs note earlier by the mailing

00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:33,629
list and there seems to be some nice

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,099
collaboration going on right with the

00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:41,219
 secret topic yeah so that's great I

00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:44,939
was hoping that that the stuff that they

00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:48,030
had made which we know was needed no

00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,319
matter how you deploy cloud foundry we

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,620
were hoping that would be used and so

00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm glad to see that it is finished

00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:00,510
packaging that up is a separate helm

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:03,629
chart Mario did okay so in there now we

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,760
would like to also move the ireenie

00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:07,829
extensions upstream that was about to

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,280
bring that up yeah I just wanna make

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:14,669
sure it's like discussion but it sounded

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:19,799
like this like two alternative thoughts

00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:23,909
on how CF SSH could be made working yeah

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:27,120
and hopefully Vlad will join okay with

00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:35,159
some advice there yeah or at least more

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:41,669
insight than I have you just make sure

00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:43,530
he's got the right link yeah actually

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:47,039
check but I believe the calendar should

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:50,240
be I gotta run it to the right oh you

00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,240
did yeah

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,340
if I can give you the three of us so far

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,580
yeah okay if I can get a virtual

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:22,820
background working Oh with my green

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:34,850
screen awesome I do

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:39,710
hey Jeff morning mr. Celeste let's also

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:57,260
always a frequent silent listener to to

00:05:39,710 --> 00:06:01,340
the sitcom I realize okay sorry it's

00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:06,080
showing us offline and slack I hope that

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:09,680
isn't a bad sign because I checked with

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:20,660
him end of last week - to be sure it

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:23,770
would be able to make it hey folks your

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,770
gay dad

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,510
glad I we were talking a little bit

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,860
earlier before you arrived about the

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,870
arrhenius tension stuff

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,430
well first about about quark secrets and

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:46,190
how that's now available for others to

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:47,840
use separately but also about ireenie

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:52,480
extensions going upstream and maybe I

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,480
mean SSH SSH

00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:06,440
yeah I pinged I remember who it was on

00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:09,700
on slack from those messages it sounded

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:14,540
like they were trying to adapt Diego SSH

00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:17,270
to do the same on irony to act as a as

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,230
an SSH gateway and that's exactly what

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,700
we did so

00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:23,660
just took that the aggressor sage go

00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,740
then adapted it work with okay me and

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,050
our parent you mentioned there was

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,150
another approach that people were

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,860
talking about I mean there was this one

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,980
slick conversation that I think was

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,680
started by by rasoi a fandom you replied

00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,490
and then I believe somebody else replied

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:47,990
and said we like want to take some of

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:50,510
the deep that I didn't have any any

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:53,420
additional details but that's what I saw

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:57,290
just like it sounds like they that is

00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:04,160
what we had done so oh and he was you it

00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:07,070
so perfect person hey you II so waiting

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,830
for people to to joining especially for

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:15,020
SIA of course the presidential forum

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:17,420
this morning while we are waiting

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,330
glutton that microphone that you have to

00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:23,180
have up there is that like a

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:29,890
professional radio broadcasting

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:32,840
oh really Pro just in the middle okay

00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,919
it's really a green screen and it does

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,830
that to impress people

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,830
ah it's actually in the background yeah

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:49,930
so what's the story with that flat you

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,250
kind of put that up especially for like

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,040
working from home or did you have that

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,790
before I actually bought it before but

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,760
never used it and when the covert thing

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,590
happened I thought since I have like a

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:09,490
nicer home office I thought I would use

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:09,490
it because then everyone can enjoy it

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:21,200
did did we ever get Flavia to talk about

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:27,320
the organ spaces for cube

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:29,270
we didn't that's actually I think like

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,850
tentatively planned for next time so

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:34,490
like after I made this

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:37,790
call of like asking everybody to talk

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,620
about kind of all things ireenie I had

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:44,329
this kind of tentative list of things

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:46,220
from thanks yeah I kind of go one but I

00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:48,829
long over the list

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,829
yeah I could give a little preview of

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:53,870
that or and then Vlad jump into correct

00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:55,190
me when I go right for a sign anyway

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,459
yeah yeah yeah

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,740
so Flavio Castel ease distinguished

00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,500
engineer at Sousa who is responsible for

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:07,279
the architecture of Sousa Cavs platform

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:13,670
so deeply into kubernetes and we talked

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:15,170
last year about how we have two

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,509
different authentication models for the

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:25,569
kubernetes api and Cloud Foundry API and

00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:25,569
what could we do to use UA a to create

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:32,000
organ space like structures and similar

00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,829
are back roles roles that are similar to

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,230
they are back roles in Cloud Foundry for

00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:40,220
kubernetes and combine them and use them

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:45,560
as a single authentication mechanism for

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:53,410
both api's is that is that a pretty good

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:56,660
summary blood yes yes he's looking at

00:10:53,410 --> 00:11:00,079
adding these concepts of orgs and spaces

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:03,470
to wrap namespaces around so you'll have

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,170
CR DS for organizations and spaces and

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,920
then people can tour around with that

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:11,959
and then you'd have an operator that

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,730
automatically sets up namespaces with

00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:17,029
the appropriate CR DS and everything

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:20,990
sorry with the appropriate roles and

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:26,689
bindings to match the origin spaces yes

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:32,990
oh yeah yeah he has a lot of detail

00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:35,329
around that and so anyways yeah we're

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,920
happy to share that because if other

00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:39,350
people are doing work in that area I

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,290
think it would be good to work together

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:45,699
on it rather than have a couple

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:49,839
different implementations all right

00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:51,100
we talked a little bit about how Rancher

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,959
had sort of done their own thing there

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,139
that's not really connected to the

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,540
kubernetes community so if we could do

00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:03,999
the thing that is you know it could be

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:06,699
broadly accepted as a as the right way

00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:10,019
to do role based access control on

00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:10,019
kubernetes that would be great

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:21,669
yeah I think lots of folks are trying to

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:29,069
figure out that abstraction mapping like

00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:34,509
what that looks like I don't see sigh

00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:36,850
like with the Green Dot Oh No maybe he's

00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:43,929
got a green dot now unlike the VMware

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:47,980
slack scrambling to get in also now has

00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:55,359
one the Cloud Foundry stick all the tabs

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:57,519
are loading I was going to say like I

00:12:55,359 --> 00:13:00,970
don't see him anywhere and we're about

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:04,959
eight minutes past starting but now he's

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:07,319
showing up a screen just sent in a

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,319
message

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:42,480
he's typing I'm curious if you're any

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:47,339
any of your submitting any tux for keep

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:50,279
con North America it's actually a good

00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:53,730
point I last thing I checked was for the

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:56,730
CF summit EU to see what the status

00:13:53,730 --> 00:14:00,440
there is but there the homepage still

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:02,250
says wait for an update later in July I

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:08,339
submitted one called

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:12,600
Cloud Foundry the good parts I believe

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:14,430
the deadline is soon for fork Yukon

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,459
North America like end of this week or

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,880
something like that but you might be

00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,640
right

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:26,750
they extended heard I heard July 12th

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:28,050
something like that that's Sunday thanks

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:34,200
hello

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:36,630
sorry I have a family situation so I may

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,149
have to take care of and when I saw the

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,000
pain guy realized actually today is Dec

00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:45,810
call it would be okay if I do it next

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:56,970

you okay okay thank you Thanks okay then

00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:03,270
the question would be any more Atok

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,790
topics we could talk about

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,949
I mean Marco just just pinged me and

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:11,310
like I don't I don't have the food

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:13,980
context but he was basically asking a

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:18,360
question of like what's the status

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:20,579
regarding route services I'm not sure if

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,770
that was actually meant to be a question

00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:26,340
for for psy or more

00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:29,040
everybody else nobody from networking is

00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,800
in the call so Hallett's maybe there's

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,690
no response to that

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:38,850
probably I don't think context yeah I

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:42,090
wouldn't want to speak authoritative Lee

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,700
for Shannon but I don't think that

00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:48,900
there's work prioritized for Grad

00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,430
services and I think that broadly the

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,610
networking team has been considering

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:58,380
this is an opportunity to review a lot

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:59,730
of the problems we've solved in the past

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,980
with route services and there may be

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,500
alternative implementations that we

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,270
could take advantage of with envoy given

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,930
the flexibility of its filter

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:15,020
configuration so I'm interpreting that

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,020
as no definitive plan right now to

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:21,510
deliberately re-implement route services

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:24,180
as they have been on the Bosch based CF

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,370
but definitely still interested in

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:38,630
solving the kinds of problems that they

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:38,630
solved I believe it is noted for

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,960
addressing at some point in the future I

00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,970
don't know if there's if anyone's

00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,010
actively working on it other than you

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,580
know recognizing the laundry list of

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,660
things that CF has done in the past and

00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,240
wanting to address it at some point in

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,940
the future

00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:00,450
having said that I I'm sure they they'd

00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:06,420
be interested in engaging with any folks

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:08,339
who'd like to dig in and try to get some

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,750
opinions or thoughts out there about

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,750
what what might make sense

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:23,420
taking note here if we have a bit of

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,950
time I think it'd be good to talk about

00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:31,790
I really X and getting that upstream so

00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:33,830
that it can be used I don't think we

00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,440
have a dedicated team to ireenie X right

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:40,550
now so it would not be a new team it

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,180
would just be a repo and responsibility

00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,360
for it

00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:48,380
Vlad that would that fall on the cube CF

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:51,020
team yeah I think that's the current set

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,440
up when we have every newer and reading

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:59,390
X work it's usually in the cube CF

00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:06,890
umbrella those things okay do we need

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:09,470
anything from run time PMC do we just or

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,240
do we just talk to Chris and and say

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:15,500
here's some more repos to add to the

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:18,830
guys if that's coming in with cube CF as

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:23,290
the owning project that sounds fine just

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,290
to talk to Chris and move them over

00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:31,910
let's just see which repos that is

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,900
obviously ireenie X itself but there's a

00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:37,760
whole bunch of ireenie

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:39,710
- ones ssh and first see

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,670
i think the person one is is pretty good

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:48,410
one that's definitely useful the helm

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:53,330
release I mean there's a yes the

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:56,500
extension CI I mean the example I mean

00:18:53,330 --> 00:19:00,200
II uh here's a arena log regatta bridge

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:03,470
is that an irate extension yeah it is

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,500
yeah is it going to be relevant six

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,190
months from now I don't know I don't

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,750
know I think we should still include it

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,910
we'll see I we definitely want to

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,840
converge with what the logging team is

00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:22,640
doing but I'm not sure how long that

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,410
period will be okay can I can I leave it

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,300
to you glad to get a list of the ones

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,650
that belong together

00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:34,950
sure Cloud Foundry or Q beta yeah

00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:34,950
yeah okay cool that was easy

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:46,300
yeah I think that makes sense and then

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,870
you know appropriate read me to explain

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,750
how these are early and I would do a lot

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:56,650
to clarify what things actually do and

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:58,240
then the status of them I know when I

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:03,250
talked with Jillian

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:06,160
here uh about I mean II Percy like very

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,410
briefly he was saying that there's

00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:13,590
actually some code injected into irony

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:17,230
itself that they did that might help

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:20,020
which which may be complimentary or or

00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,920
who knows with with what the Hirini

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:27,310
Percy work did but they're they're also

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,410
on pause for the moment as they there

00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,840
many of the team members who are working

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:38,470
on volume services are trying to help

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:40,620
get CF for Kate's to GA era one daughter

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:44,200
as a case may be

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,850
yeah well that might be all the more

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,580
reason to look at I really person

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,940
because I think you know it's done it it

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,630
works

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:55,510
and I think it works pretty well

00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:58,450
Vlad I haven't I've run it myself it's

00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,840
not in the release version which one

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:05,590
person yeah every knee Percy yeah yeah

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,950
that one is sort of a catch-all for all

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,930
storage classes that run so if you have

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:14,110
search classes configured to on your

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:18,070
kubernetes you can expose them as Percy

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:20,440
services in Cloud Foundry so you just

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,690
get everything that cube supports you

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:27,790
get as a persistent service for your

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:30,000
ireenie apps so and that seems to work

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,000
well

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:46,629
only one open issue I'll go depended

00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:49,330
please okay yeah I mean daddy is pretty

00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:52,499
simple and it offloads all of the hard

00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:55,330
parts to kubernetes right all the mounts

00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:57,549
volume providers drivers everything is

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:01,599
handled by cube all we do is actually

00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:04,720
just broke her stuff then I guess it

00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:07,539
depends on the on the actual kubernetes

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,210
underlay implementation if there is then

00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:12,369
like I don't know the official term but

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,710
this like a single container can read

00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:16,210
right from it versus like multiple

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,429
containers can write into it

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,080
simultaneously and then kind of sync

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,090
back and forth all of that I guess would

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,869
be would be handled by whatever

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:29,019
properties the underlying kubernetes and

00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:30,609
is provides right I think the way that

00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:36,429
this works is you have a dynamic

00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:38,649
provisioner so we don't it's it's used

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:41,889
as a volume clean template inside the

00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:43,950
stateful set of the app so you get a new

00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:50,669
volume for each instance of your app

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:55,359
okay so even though you you can reach

00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:58,450
multiple even though you might be able

00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,889
to multi do multiple writes I don't

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,729
think there's an instance where that

00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:07,419
happens for for this particular set up

00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:13,269
so late effects so the the the instances

00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:14,409
of the app do not share a file system no

00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:18,039
not usually

00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:20,409
no it's like it's actually not going to

00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:22,359
be possible usually if you have a multi

00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:27,609
a-z set up because most of the cloud

00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:29,649
providers won't support like one

00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:33,340
supported it's not possible I'll just

00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:36,299
cross a Z mount onto filesystem I don't

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:39,359
know if this any provider that has

00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:42,009
support for this kind of storage

00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:45,159
don't be something more special in that

00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:46,730
case you could still use NFS for example

00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:52,580
and have

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:55,520
an NFS Percy broker for example

00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:03,049
connected to your CF or Cates or coupe

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:08,570
CF forgive me if this is an ignorant

00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:11,210
question but if the instances of an

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:16,580
application are not sharing state on the

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:19,730
file system what's it for for storing

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,049
stuff but each you know storing stuff

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,440
that will be different for each instance

00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:27,020
of the application like databases do

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,580
that too for example it's just me

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:35,890
receiving right I mean that's not what

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:38,270
Percy was provide single tap storage

00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,840
with any of the Percy stuff before this

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,440
right

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,299
sorry glad you hey yeah we haven't had

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:49,070
it before but it was a use case they

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:51,650
were interested in exploring for certain

00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:55,730
types of apps like sometimes you need

00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:57,950
more storage attached than is normally

00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,490
available right for a certain kind of

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:04,460
app or you need certain speed because

00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:08,020
you're handling like geospatial data or

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:12,650
something like that or certain apps that

00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:15,340
expect to write locally but don't want

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:22,250
that overwritten by some other thing

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:24,530
yeah sorry things like WordPress or

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,210
Drupal in the olden days when you did

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,610
the first time install it would actually

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,610
write a file which can with

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,950
configuration on the local disk yeah and

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:37,970
you couldn't get around that if if you

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,980
restarted the apps and the config file

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,640
would go away and then you know I get it

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,720
I get it but but the other use the other

00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,710
thing that comes from that use case is

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,500
content management systems where you're

00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,540
uploading a file right a lot of these

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,100
frameworks just use the file system

00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,330
because it's expecting to be running on

00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,160
a bare metal server and they never

00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,380
really updated it to use the database

00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,230
properly so

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:07,570
shared volumes whether a great way to

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:13,100
just run not not cloud native things

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:16,070
well enough in that's that's what I use

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,110
good for with sample and the Percy

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:24,530
driver I don't I think it would create

00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:27,290
directories for each instance no no no

00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:29,720
there was Percy was shared persistent

00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:32,770
file storage I'm gonna create in

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:38,990
different directories per application

00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:43,580
period yeah I'm Percy NFS earth sorry

00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:45,410
and the NFS in SEF in the NFS broker did

00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,020
this as well and this is what you would

00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:50,480
use it for you would use it drew an

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,940
untrue poet like Django or something

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,710
when you you're blogging and you upload

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,740
an image that image is shared through

00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:00,380
all instances of the app and yes

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:04,460
yeah and it's right that the storage

00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:07,520
provider might not support multiple

00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:12,590
rights you know it very much depends on

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,840
what you're attaching to anyway that's

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:22,610
interesting so that clearly needs to be

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:25,070
discussed a little bit all uh and then

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:28,430
and this would have come to light when

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:31,840
we started writing to readme for our

00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:36,830
rainy percy repo or putting it upstream

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:42,920
no wait I'm reading the code now I think

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:45,500
it's shared I don't we'll have to see

00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,710
but you can't have it shared across a

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:53,060
ZZZ like period it depends depends on

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:55,190
the storage class right yeah ok yeah it

00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,680
might not be excluded from the

00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:01,760
possibilities from an kubernetes api

00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:04,040
standpoint but you can't even get like i

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,710
think on AWS you don't even get multiple

00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:10,010
write disks that you can attach to two

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:12,440
hosts to two worker nodes so that no

00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,540
matter where they run they get it maybe

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,980
i'm wrong with that but

00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,220
and I'm not sure if there is a storage

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,480
class for actually getting cross easy

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:26,580
disks mounted because I don't know if

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,560
they exist I don't think they do yeah

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,080
there is so when the the service gets

00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:35,450
created we get a persistent volume and

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:40,650
then whenever a binding happens we just

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:47,820
we just mount we have the volume mounts

00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:50,010
be appended to to a pod so if if the

00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,500
search class support supports multiple

00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:55,230
read/write they should see the same

00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:59,880
thing so it's not using a persistent

00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:03,720
volume claim template so that's good I

00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:08,790
guess what you want to try that's what I

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:16,770
want I'm so glad I was my vague instinct

00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:20,100
was correct I and and yet I do remember

00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:25,170
hitting this with one of the Stratos

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:26,280
persistent volumes yeah so I I know what

00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,980
you're talking about

00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:33,810
exists but I don't know why we don't hit

00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:39,240
that with GPU normally and we use that

00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:44,480
it's a storage class I think it's how

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:50,550
you set up the I have some code here

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:54,480
terraform talk amongst yourselves I'm

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:57,480
just I mean I would like to encourage

00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,740
folks to either themselves or encourage

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:04,890
others to consider submitting a talk for

00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:08,520
cubic on cloud native Khan

00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:14,610
I think there's relevant topics that we

00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:19,070
could submit to to that and so dates

00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,070
coming up but please try to make time I

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:26,580
I've never really had great luck with

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,679
Cloud Foundry

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,019
Epic's submitted to cube card they've

00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,850
all been rejected but mind you almost

00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,429
everything is predicted to console I

00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:38,909
don't take I don't take it personally

00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:42,450
but this time I just went in and so we

00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:44,309
tried to sort of talk generally about

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,470
platform as a service and not Cloud

00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:48,269
Foundry specifically and or try to you

00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:51,390
know talk about application delivery

00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:52,769
instead of and as soon as you put the

00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:55,370
word cloud foundry in there it seemed to

00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:58,409
be like the kiss of death for acceptance

00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:01,190
this time I just went all in and made a

00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:03,389
sort of self-deprecating abstract about

00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:07,980
Cloud Foundry the good parts where we

00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:10,399
will fess up to the previously non cloud

00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:13,830
native nature of parts of Cloud Foundry

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,600
and talk about the talk about cloud

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,880
foundry warts and all because you know

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,909
they would I think that might be more of

00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,490
a draw for people who who are for

00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:26,549
whatever reason prejudiced against pass

00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:34,019
or Cloud Foundry so I'll share that

00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:36,330
abstract if I can find it yeah I mean

00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:40,019
the their topics are sort of like does

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:43,230
it include these technologies that

00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:49,169
happened to be in part a part of CN CF

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:52,980
and so yeah that there are a lot of

00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:55,110
topic talks that are probably submitted

00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:59,760
and I'm a high percentage of them don't

00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:01,529
get accepted but I did you know I it's

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,690
disappointing if you can say like

00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:07,860
actually Cloud Foundry is using like six

00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:11,940
or more of these projects and CF or

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,470
adopting aggressively you know a bunch

00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,899
of these projects and we can check off

00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:18,389
all those boxes and we can list all of

00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:20,519
them and yes this is an open source

00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:23,809
project and so it's disappointing if

00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:23,809
it's not considered

00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:37,040
I can't find the abstract right now but

00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:37,040
I'll I'll send it on I'll keep trying I

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:45,630
did actually have a chat with the Cloud

00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:48,600
Foundry people who I think Caitlin and

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,190
chip who and who have said that there is

00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:55,350
an effort going by the Linux Foundation

00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:57,000
to the force to force the umbrella

00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,680
communities to play nicely with each

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,940
other and to include each other stuff so

00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:06,320
there is a I am told a thawing of the

00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:11,940
maybe silo Inc a thawing of the silos

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:20,250
I'm mixing my metaphors here that's

00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:22,230
great alright do you want to continue

00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:27,660
are we all out of topics that's just

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:31,200
about to ask for the hour maybe good

00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:33,870
stopping point yeah yeah okay then I

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:42,410
think rule puts I on the agenda for for

00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:42,410
the next call and then yes okay

00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,510
