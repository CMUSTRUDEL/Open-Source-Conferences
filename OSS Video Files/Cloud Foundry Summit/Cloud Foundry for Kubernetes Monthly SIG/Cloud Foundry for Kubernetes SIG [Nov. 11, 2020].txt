00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,799
new webcam who did lisa

there we go we're coming out the right

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,280
speakers now i should probably stay

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,479
silent for most of this because it's all

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,759
uh down to you uh

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,880
important folks i actually know what

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,880
you're talking about i'll just

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,360
we need to always hear from the peeps

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,119
who are

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,119
on the ground using it in anger so

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,880
no things with you anything exciting uh

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,479
going on

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,240
yeah i saw some uh cool stuff that

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,240
vlad and julio are putting together

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,399
yesterday

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,920
thinking outside the proverbial box was

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,159
cool

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:08,160
um otherwise yeah just

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,200
waiting for uh waiting for the

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,959
uh acquisition to close

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,720
yeah yeah i just realized this recorded

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,319
and that's the problem

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,800
yeah can't go divulging any uh

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,319
comedy secrets right now i could i just

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,440
would get into some trouble

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,440
probably yeah i don't think engineer

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,280
better has an astounding secrets to

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,680
share unfortunately what have i been

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,480
doing on the um

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
cf and cube's front there um it was

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,120
interesting

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,160
teaching people some uh cloud foundry

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
basics this morning

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,959
and yesterday um

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,599
the it's

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,080
trying to explain what is changing and

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,680
between the three different flavors

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,239
um is definitely a challenge

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,040
i i know they happen to be using uh

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,599
cloud foundry for vms at the moment

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,480
so i was focusing on that but um you

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,879
know there are some good

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,879
questions coming out of it and

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,760
yeah it would be it would be nice if

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,800
there was some sort of feature matrix or

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,000
you know architectural comparison type

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,440
thing right now um cf

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,200
is um supposed to be

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,799
i think entirely compatible from a

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,920
user's perspective with

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,519
with vmcf and

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,159
anything that isn't should probably be

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,680
regarded as a bug

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,840
yeah and that makes it quite handy um

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,799
in terms of uh the fact that there's

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,560
just the

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,319
um the the public feature set is like

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,720
i've got i've got to talk at a meet up

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,239
in an hour and a half and when

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,920
the part of my brain responsible for

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,480
speaking is just dead oh i

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,239
i feel you that was me at the end of

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,239
yesterday i was talking all day

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,080
the um mismatch between um one dan jones

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,360
hello christopher clark missing you at

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,519
uh various summits dan

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,439
i see troy you know semi-regularly on

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,360
the old zoom but uh

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,560
not the same thing either but uh you

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,439
know

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,959
yeah it it sucks the the lack of

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,400
conferences and seeing

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,520
other humans and it does yes ah but

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,080
uh we might have a vaccine soon that is

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,960
good news

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,120
positive for the first time in a while

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,479
yes

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,160
yeah i'm going to um uh

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,280
not not hold my breath on that front i'm

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,520
clear no i mean um

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,880
cautiously optimistic that maybe a year

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,479
from now we can do things

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,120
but yeah yeah it would be nice wouldn't

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,440
it

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,199
try this whole process has made me

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,000
realize how much i enjoy that aspect of

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
the job

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,639
oh yeah absolutely i mean you know

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,680
there's no other job that has that

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,199
aspect right now

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:05,280
you know but uh yes i yeah it's uh

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,600
it was that was particularly nice

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,840
um you guys did this meeting get

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
cancelled

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,759
time to tune in to the old cf for kate's

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,479
channel and read

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,960
all the cf4k8 stuff and look for the sig

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,680
stuff

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,680
i think we should

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,440
uh see if a parent has

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,440
sent anything to the group

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,120
i haven't seen anything recently oh yeah

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,400
yep replied to a thread canceling the

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,960
sig call on

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,840
2020 1110 due to lack of topic

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,960
suggestions

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,560
cc at chris clark

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,560
cool okay well

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,759
there that is okay well i could you know

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,680
chris

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,319
if if you had canceled this i could have

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,800
been on a really really exciting call

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,840
about

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,199
cicd scripts for qcf right now

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,440
i could have really gotten into the

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,360
weeds about how we package uh

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:13,039
you know things for yeah i missed that

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,240
oh well um well lovely to see both

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,360
anyway um i'm gonna go commute to san

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,919
francisco

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,440
where i in theory still have an office

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,639
that i can sometimes go to

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,240
oh wow yeah the linux foundation offices

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,440
were not renewing the lease

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,280
so they won't exist i believe i'm not

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,240
sure whether it's december 1 or january

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
1.

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,280
but i don't think they've shut the

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,880
internet off and no one else goes there

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,400
so i've been going in like once a week

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,240
just for like sanity to get out of the

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
house and like feel like a normal person

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
like

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,639
driving they're driving across a bridge

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,240
commuting and stuff

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,120
there's such nice offices too while you

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,000
still have it

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,680
yeah indeed so where are you are you

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,120
going to be all off site or

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,400
yeah the linux foundation will be

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,160
entirely remote which isn't that

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,400
different than what it was really i mean

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,080
you know those offices were nice but

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
they were as you might imagine rather

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,960
expensive

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,280
and um so so jealous

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,639
dan have you ever seen them no no i

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
haven't sounds like i never will now

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,360
either

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,400
linux foundation was in the presidio in

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,759
san francisco

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,520
around lucas arts and some other fancy

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,880
vc firms and it's like this

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,160
park land uh surrounding these uh

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,680
it looked like right out of a science

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,160
fiction film you know this like

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,800
beautifully manicured landscaped

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,759
gardens all around right right by the

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,120
golden gate bridge

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,440
i mean it's amazing that's pretty nice

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,039
i'll um have to look it up in google

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,000
maps i mean i've walked over to golden

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,560
gate bridge

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,680
once many years if you are ever in

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,120
um san francisco uh you should check out

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,599
the presidio and

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,639
just that area there's a statue of yoda

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,360
there is uh

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,039
you know i guess the i guess the star

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,000
wars store which isn't that exciting but

00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,599
it's lucas arts

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
is there so they've got lucas lucas

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,879
films is there so there's

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
you know lots of star wars things

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,639
happening all the time which is fun

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,160
and uh how did i how did i not know this

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,360
or not notice

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,440
when i was there i've walked i walked

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,120
along the beach to the north of that

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,160
um half mile away yeah

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:27,039
i'm trying to think uh

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:31,039
there was some building that was uh

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,320
palace palace palace columns look like a

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,560
kind of fake greek

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,360
roman thing what's it called that's the

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,440
palace of fine arts yes yeah

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,370
yeah pretty built for a world's fair in

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
like 190 something

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,519
[Music]

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,519
yeah so i remember the hill yeah so i've

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,320
managed to miss one of the the best bits

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,320
i've been selling

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,920
i did go to a trampolining park

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,240
um or crossing the bridge and that that

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,760
was about as exciting as that got

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,600
i should probably stop talking bollocks

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,920
and let you go okay

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,320
