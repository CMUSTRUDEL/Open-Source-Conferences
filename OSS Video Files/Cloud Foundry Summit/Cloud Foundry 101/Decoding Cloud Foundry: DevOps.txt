I'm going to talk about the principles

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,970
around DevOps some of the challenges and

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:10,410
misconceptions with DevOps and its

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,910
relevance to Cloud Foundry because

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,500
DevOps is more of a culture than a

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,540
methodology it means different things to

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,920
different people but I really like the

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,949
way one of my colleagues is to find

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,500
DevOps it's a parallel solution to a

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,380
perpendicular problem so what does that

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,240
really mean well if you think about the

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,090
way most enterprises are structured

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,030
they're structured around these silos of

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,430
speciality and these different groups

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,380
whether it's networking or security or

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,390
project management they have these

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,550
firewalls between them and you end up

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,680
with these crazy flows of communication

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,440
and between these different business

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,090
units you get tickets and handoffs and

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,120
delays every step of the way and it can

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,640
be very painful the parallel solution

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,350
here is to break down those solid walls

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,140
and break down those communication

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,239
blockages and realign your team into

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,370
this cross-functional team all pulling

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,400
in the same direction or focused around

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,939
a single business capability this is

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,729
your DevOps team the misconception with

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,710
DevOps is it's just a team of generic

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,009
developers responsible for absolutely

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,350
everything the reality is a number of

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,360
different business capability teams each

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,880
focused around an individual business

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,060
capability responsible for the entire

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,369
application lifecycle so how does Cloud

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,049
Foundry help with DevOps well it's

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,909
fantastic that you now have business

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,970
capability teams focused on a product

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,790
rather than silos of speciality focused

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,740
on a project but those teams those

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,450
DevOps teams still need a platform to

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,310
deploy against in order to ship with

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,880
velocity and that's where Cloud Foundry

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,880
