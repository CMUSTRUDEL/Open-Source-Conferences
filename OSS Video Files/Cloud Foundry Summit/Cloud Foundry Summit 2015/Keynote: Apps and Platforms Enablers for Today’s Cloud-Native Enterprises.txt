cool thank you very much it's great

00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,279
being here at the at the foundry summit

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,710
so I'd like to talk to you briefly a

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,000
little bit about HP's vision for

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,200
bringing the cloud of the enterprise and

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,540
then we'll talk some more about some

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,059
customers and a little bit more about

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,609
something and I think that's an aside so

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,350
when we talked to our customers a lot of

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,060
things bubble up and one of the major

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,000
things that bubble up and has helped us

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,490
think through what do we believe about

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,180
this cloud revolution is that we believe

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,369
it's open

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,900
we believe it's hybrid and that's one of

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,700
the reasons we're so excited about being

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,620
in the cloud foundry participating in

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,719
this community our customers are always

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,980
telling us that we want to go faster and

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,020
they want to move their application

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,390
development teams and enable them to

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,070
move faster and faster when I talk with

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,989
CIOs or talk with leaders of

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,910
infrastructure for these large companies

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,950
they talk about the roadblocks that are

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,420
in their way and when a team wants to

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,760
try and experiment or wants to try

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,800
something innovative it takes days and

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,750
weeks to bring their infrastructure to

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,870
place and it takes a long time to get

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,609
the C IDC C ICD systems going so when

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,470
they hear about the kind of application

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,030
development processes that can get

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,260
enabled by cloud foundry they're very

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,390
excited and as we move forward in the in

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,549
the industry we think about open as

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,549
being more than of a winning vendor lock

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,909
n it means about getting embedded in an

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,130
innovation cycle that is taking over the

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,500
industry whether it is other open source

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,420
projects whether it's a OpenStack which

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,100
we're deeply involved in the amount of

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,200
innovation and that amount of evolution

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,000
that you see going on on a daily weekly

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,729
basis is truly amazing

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,200
and launching the foundation has really

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,850
been exactly the right conditions for

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,530
Cloud Foundry it's really opened up this

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,509
community and it's great to see the

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,950
amazing growth we have here and I can

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,390
see that when we come back we're going

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,310
to open up the back part of the room and

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,790
then double the size again which is

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,790
truly awesome

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:59,310
so we've been at this about a year and

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,780
you know one point version one customers

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,170
have some perceptions with that right so

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,729
with its generated perceptions around

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,039
lack of build packs the ecosystem was

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,360
still still booting up and so as we

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,280
talked to folks they're very excited to

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
see what's going on in - and when you

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,940
talk about Version three

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,640
people's eyes light up and so all the

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,350
work that's going on there I think is

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,710
absolutely exciting now getting the

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,980
foundation in place is enabling us to

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:29,310
get better clearer roadmaps and from an

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,220
enterprise adoption perspective because

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,900
I'm an X Devin a tons of us or X devs in

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,210
the room or dabs it's like why do I need

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,060
these roadmaps they want to know what we

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,340
care about a roadmap is an expression of

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,290
the kinds of problems that we want to

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,290
solve or that we believe we're going to

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,600
be solving for our customers some of our

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,780
customers have got 10,000 application

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,180
developers and they've got huge teams

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,040
they're trying to help make those people

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,450
more effective and productive so they're

00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,910
trying to figure out what do I need to

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,190
do in the next year 18 months to

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,810
intersect what this community is doing

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,970
because they want to make investments

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,040
that aren't right in our path they wanna

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,230
make investments to integrate in to make

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,380
use of the kind of technologies that the

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,000
teams here are building and with it and

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,630
with that we see they're gonna be more

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,980
more clear cadence around roadmaps so

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,170
one of the things that we're excited

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,470
about what we've been doing with an HP

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,980
is really strengthening the bindings

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,300
between OpenStack and Cloud Foundry

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,220
big believer in making sure that the

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,110
infrastructure layer and the paddler can

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,660
work really well together we believe

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,730
that the interconnections we we offer

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,040
trove in our trove which is the my

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,720
sequel database is a service inside our

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,610
foundry offering we believe that

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,050
increasing those connections means that

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,239
we can make better use of the hardware

00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,360
and infrastructure to move things

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,360
forward

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,099
so one of the things that kind of people

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,930
asked about is like so exactly what is

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,790
the definition of CF because this is a

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,040
as a new thing people are trying to

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,319
understand where is the definition lie

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,720
is it within the implementation is it

00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,060
within the API where do where does the

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:17,190
community want to take it and having

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:19,680
I've spent my entire OpenStack lifecycle

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,250
I was was the beginning of OpenStack and

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,169
we had exactly the same problems

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,450
OpenStack the the code is the definition

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,950
of the product so there's challenges to

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,870
figure out do we want to do that here

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,910
how do we how important do we want to

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:37,500
make the API definition versus the

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,580
implementation definition you know when

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,100
I talk to customers is a bit of

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,910
confusion especially going on with the

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,380
confusion mental that containers have

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,590
and containers the container technology

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,050
with kubernetes mezzos docker and many

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,720
more making sure we've got a clear

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,970
perspective in this community as what is

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,039
the relationship how do we act and we

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,650
interact with them what does it mean and

00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,270
as these both these communities evolve

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,500
and they're evolving very rapidly they

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,390
think about where Cloud Foundry was a

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,919
year ago where docker and containers

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,680
were a year ago they're both on this

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,300
tremendous development path to

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,370
accelerate application development

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,970
productivity and to enable cloud native

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,890
applications in promoting the work of

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,360
our fellows of the foundation with more

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,120
than 50 companies involved it's

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,479
absolutely a huge movement movement at

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,479
this point

00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,789
so one of the things I like to talk

00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,830
about is I spend a lot of time talking

00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:36,090
with our customers and talking with CIOs

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,029
and VPS of infrastructure and

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,069
application development and I always

00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:44,490
start to ask like what problem are you

00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:47,069
trying to solve and why and tell me what

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,349
would make a great year for you and what

00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:52,139
what is your CEO trying to ask you to do

00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,490
and what I end up with is a lot of great

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,889
conversations not about the technology

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,029
and not about the product but about the

00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,699
problems we're trying to solve

00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:01,680
I think that's half the work and so some

00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,259
of the feedback that I've gotten is that

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,270
the enterprises need features that are

00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,499
behind the farm there that are unable to

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,999
be behind the firewall

00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:10,860
they're completely isolated from the

00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:12,839
internet they don't wanna be able to

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,439
download build packs they want to be

00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:18,449
isolated they want to be able to build

00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,219
packs where they can integrate in their

00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:22,819
own systems in to make that a

00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:26,240
first-class citizen within Cloud Foundry

00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:28,560
they really really like the fact that

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,089
Ajay is taken care of

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,650
for the application developer but they

00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:35,399
want to make sure that the Ops people

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,889
have a good way to manage scaling Nha

00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,689
right out of the box and those

00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,750
extensions where their service packs or

00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:45,870
brokers enabling them to tie into the

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,669
hundreds of interesting algorithmic

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,139
systems they've already built to make

00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,939
those things accessible into their own

00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,529
systems they want to bring that to the

00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:53,399
application developer because that's

00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,800
right now what they've got to do is

00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:59,789
they're handcrafting to the tools for

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,039
the application devs when we think about

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:05,339
other aspects of it were the Java

00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:08,580
development teams with dotnet teams and

00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:10,560
and as I look about probably 4045

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,169
percent of our enterprise customers are

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,110
running net so there's a huge amount of

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,789
amount of effort and so what we see in

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,849
that is we see we've seen a movement

00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:24,029
where we've got the ability to bring

00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:27,330
dotnet to Cloud Foundry and that's what

00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:30,060
we've done today so today we've released

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,710
development platform version 1.2 it's

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,339
actually in production it's on our

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,810
public cloud and you can try it out

00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:38,909
right now enterprise can developers can

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,990
develop and deploy cloud native

00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:46,740
applications

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:49,800
on v2 natively so we offer native dot

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,410
native dotnet support with Windows DEA

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,009
droplets bring your own Windows license

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:58,740
visual studio integration my sequel

00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:03,680
inside Microsoft sequel server

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,699
integration got to say something wrong

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,729
that's the next week when I'm talking

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,199
and OpenStack an application development

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,120
and application development tools and

00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,900
technologies integrating in with your

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,690
IDE s

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,120
so whatever ID you have we connect into

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,889
that so we're very excited about how

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,050
this is going to really bring that

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,180
forward and enable the enterprise

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,400
developers to they make more full use of

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,770
Cloud Foundry of the applications we

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,760
have we've also tightened the

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:36,180
integration between the OpenStack and

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,149
the pass layer with Cloud Foundry so we

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,459
make trove as a first-class citizen we

00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:43,890
allow Cloud Foundry and OpenStack

00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:46,649
operators and admins to manipulate and

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,320
control those technologies and so it's

00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:52,050
it's a very nice tight binding between

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,060
the application lifecycle management and

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,060
the actual underlying paths

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:04,370
so that allows us to really make sure

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,550
that developers can work within sequel

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:10,250
server provide self-service database of

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,110
database resources and basically

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,520
eliminate the need for operate for

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:20,600
operators to be able to manage these

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:22,400
visas containers so the other last part

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,680
about this is we've got all the SDKs and

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,380
the dotnet toolkits so within cloud

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,900
foundry we've got the we've got we have

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,600
the Visual Studio Explorer and within

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,950
the IT operations side we have the

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,370
ability to be able to basically have

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,720
those managed very well so with that I'd

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,100
like to just give you one more one more

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,700
thing that that's really not not all

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,590
we've got

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,660
so we've open sourced all of this work

00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:48,710
it's on github today it has absolutely

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,590
contributed all back to the community

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:54,050
you can do a quick developer trial on

00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,700
our public cloud like I said and we're

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,350
really proud members of this community

00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,080
we're proud to have this as part of

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,450
being accepted into it into the foundry

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,520
and really I want to give a big thanks

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,630
out to the the HP development team which

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,040
I think some of you guys are back over

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,880
there thank you so much for all the work

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,880
that you guys have done

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,660
so really thank you very much for all it

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,670
all they're tight at a time and effort

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,850
I'm going to hand this over back back to

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,850
