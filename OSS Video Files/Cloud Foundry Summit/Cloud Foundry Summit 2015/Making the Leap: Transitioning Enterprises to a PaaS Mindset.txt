all right the post lunch crowd very

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,170
excited about this see if we keep you

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,660
awake thank you for joining us today my

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,460
name is Richard Shirota I had a VP of

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,040
Product for CenturyLink and CenturyLink

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,080
lab will be talking today a little bit

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,090
about the enterprise transition to pass

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,460
and some of the objections you may face

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,619
and hopefully answer on that journey so

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,750
who do work for CenturyLink or an 85

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,550
year old telecommunications company the

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,890
second-largest Colo provider in the

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,840
world their largest telco company we've

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,239
got a Gardner recognized public cloud

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,850
we've bought up fog a few years back and

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,380
do public pass based on cloud foundry

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,530
launched the first dotnet extensions

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,930
back in 2011 with iron foundry do a lot

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,370
of stuff in this space and part of that

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,110
gives us some unique perspective on

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,270
companies who are doing everything from

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,340
managed hosting to doing straight up

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,170
paths and you know it's not always just

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,270
as simple as a cloud native sort of

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,770
transition so excited to talk a little

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,570
bit about what it means to do this

00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,219
transition I've also been playing with

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,539
cloud foundry for a few years I taught

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,370
the training course you can find on

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,589
Pluralsight comm that goes through a

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,909
developer training it's a fun technology

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,720
so appreciate the chance to chat with

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,760
you about it so for five one it's good

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,400
outfit coat a left there but they're

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,110
still cool doing good stuff with the

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,119
cloud they did a research report that

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,939
showed that 42% of workloads over the

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,759
next two years or targeting cloud a lot

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,259
it's a lot but you might be led to

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,880
believe if you follow at least my

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,579
Twitter feed or maybe your own that

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,710
everyone's doing containers your parents

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,530
can use terraform and third graders are

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,299
writing go like my gosh everything is

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,340
moving way too fast but that's not

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,290
really the case as we know that the same

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,780
survey actually showed that they asked

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,149
IT managers what stage of your IT

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:50,610
journeyer um and 40% said virtualization

00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:52,619
that really really so 40% are in that

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,909
meaty part of virtualizing or

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,409
infrastructure which shouldn't be that

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,299
surprising if you actually live and

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,159
breed that everyday but to someone who

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,799
might be thinking the world has now

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,200
moved on and passes so five years ago

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,909
that's a really interesting reminder

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,759
that 20% of those said they're in the

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,590
automation phase only six percent are

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,750
doing orchestration like really advanced

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,220
stuff so we're still in this point of

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,170
trying to figure

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,940
how do we optimize in this environment a

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,920
lot of room to take advantage of what

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,750
Cloud Foundry and pass has to offer or

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,880
cloud native applications whatever

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,610
acronym we're using but that that's a

00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,250
really valuable area we haven't passed

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,090
that we're still entering that phase but

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,640
the key in what I'm gonna talk about

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,720
today is the approach is different

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,100
arguably cloud foundry and

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,770
platform-as-a-service is the most

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,480
disruptive of the cloud modalities right

00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,300
it's not software as-a-service where

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,460
things kind of you know I can understand

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,830
that right I'm consuming office 365 or

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,870
Salesforce it makes sense infrastructure

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,730
is a service I might lift and shift VMs

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,770
and do a kind of a lazy migration that

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,209
works fine platform as-a-service is a

00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,550
fundamentally different way of thinking

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,040
about designing deploying and running

00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,540
apps so how do you possibly inject that

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,150
into an enterprise that may have spent

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:05,390
decades building up process and tech to

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,920
not do that I mean what's the goal we'll

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,180
talk about this hopefully this will be

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,650
the theme through the rest of it but the

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,300
point is we're trying to go faster we're

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,280
trying to be relevant we're trying to

00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,440
make sure that as companies were growing

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,420
and we're doing interesting things it's

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,680
not the technology right we we all have

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,360
introduced technology into our

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,340
organizations but just doing it for the

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,570
sake of it makes no difference so is the

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,910
point I'm trying to be a productive

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,950
company so what's the problem first

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,390
quick area I'm sure if I polled you all

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,959
on me let me amuse myself for just a

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:37,630
second any who's a developer few who

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,769
manages developers know a few upside

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,200
mustaches who just attend conferences to

00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:45,140
get information some senior executives

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,459
well done all right so if I polled the

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,200
different groups and said what are your

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,090
problems from an IT space right where do

00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,640
I spend my time and IT we all know some

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,019
of these there's areas of server sprawl

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,120
especially now in the cloud where

00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,190
anybody can do anything they want with a

00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,959
credit card I mean I can buy ERP with a

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,820
credit card that is horrifying and

00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,620
awesome then I can do those sorts of

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,200
things so that means if you're an

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,060
operation that is a disaster of how do I

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,920
keep track of my things they're all over

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,959
the place I have a bunch of servers with

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,519
3% utilization and they're all over the

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,769
place I don't know if they're in use or

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,450
not what's going on I've got

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,580
configuration drift where I couldn't

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,280
recreate this app environment to save my

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,870
life because I have patched and updated

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,120
ended on all these things and now it's

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,000
this careful precious snowflake I can't

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,380
destroy

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,480
so that's fine that happens a lot of

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,220
times you also clearly have costs

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,680
structures changing you have the pace of

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,540
tech and we joke about this but I'm paid

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,430
to keep track of this and I barely can I

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,900
I don't know how most of you are able to

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,700
keep up with the pace of tech and

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,280
innovation and that can be daunting as

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,720
you figure out where to spend your time

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,730
you've got how many people actually test

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,530
their DR scenarios most survey shows it

00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,060
is a very small embarrassing number a

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,130
proud hand back there I appreciate that

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,020
but most people are terrified of a

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,370
failover scenario is that something

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,320
that's built into your service structure

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,810
skill sets are they keeping up to date

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,790
and am i maximizing investments if I

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,410
talk to most companies and you know as

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,870
all of us think about it you've got data

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,430
centers full of decades of investment

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,110
that you're not going to throw away

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,060
tomorrow to use a cloud native

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,110
application platform or public cloud

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,760
that's insane

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,410
right you're not going to do that you

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,390
want to think of ways to take advantage

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,000
of that versus necessarily scrapping at

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,530
all but I would argue if your CEO is

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,240
being kept up at night it is not because

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,919
of any of those things because those are

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,870
manifestations of something and those

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,640
are causing problems but you're worried

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,560
about things like strategy decay it was

00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,990
a term used by Dave gray in this great

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,640
book the connected company and this idea

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,620
of you know successful strategies are

00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,990
copied there you have this period of

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,790
hyper competition right now where it's

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,040
really easy to disrupt someone else with

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,840
very little capital investment so how am

00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,400
i keeping my strategy up-to-date how am

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,410
I making sure that I am pivoting when

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,450
I'm detecting a new market when I'm

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,210
seeing that growth is slowing that's

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,650
what's keeping people up at night 33% of

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,050
CEO said growth was their number-one

00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,910
priority and their focus how am I making

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,580
sure my strategy from three years ago

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,919
isn't now irrelevant and am i moving

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,140
fast enough right an enterprise

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:09,510
typically become successful over time by

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,030
creating a lot of efficiency processes

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,260
that does not lend itself to flexibility

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,270
and agility it lends itself to

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,280
consolidation and standardization and

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,460
then a freak out when you do something

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,169
that's non-standard so how do we pivots

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,970
a little bit internally and change

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,740
internally to handle the fact that I

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,240
need to be able to build applications

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,300
that change I need to be able to

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,220
innovate faster let's talk about that

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,750
so why cloud foundry I would argue there

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,820
shouldn't be a CEO who could care less

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,740
about cloud foundry that they're super

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,450
involved and maybe that's cool but they

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,710
probably have a lot of technologies that

00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,750
they're worried about they're worried

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,790
about things like am i getting things to

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,590
market faster and learning faster am i

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,810
entering something interesting there is

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,060
this helping me do that if yes let's

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,720
keep talking if no then I can't spend

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,990
time on it

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,610
am i experimenting boy with this rate of

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,350
change of Technology it's never been

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,600
more fun to be able to say let me try

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,430
something and see if this works maybe at

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,140
a low cost and throw this in the market

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,800
maybe a bombs who cares I'll take it

00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,660
offline

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,610
no more two-year three-year five-year

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,440
projects that you don't know if we're

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,230
gonna succeed quicker experimentation

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,630
I need a low barrier to entry though I

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,670
can't start from zero and scratch and

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,350
try to think about how in the world do I

00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,150
pick up this technology and start using

00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,040
it I need value on day one is this

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,750
approachable is this something that my

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,060
developers can use is it something my

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,770
operations staff won't mutiny over right

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,720
can I can I take advantage of that and

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,370
the app centric approach you've seen

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,320
some more of this I know this from this

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,870
conference is it completely shifts your

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,480
mindset from going I care about servers

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,340
to servers are irrelevant OS is

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,480
irrelevant to some extent I care about

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,190
the app because you know what your

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,660
customers couldn't care less about which

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,340
flavor of Windows or Linux you're

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,050
running they cared that they use that

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,300
mobile app to do their health stuff on

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,950
the go or things like that so taking an

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,540
app centric approach is a customer

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,660
centric approach a server approach is

00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,220
not so I thought do a little challenge

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,990
response having an argument with myself

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,300
which happens in my head a lot I am

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,220
seeking attention for it but what

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,990
matters is can I ask questions whether

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,700
the questions we hear so I polled our

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,210
field staff I talked to some of our

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,770
customers and said why Pass why not do

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,150
you even care if I even walk in the door

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,010
and say are you interested in paths I'm

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,870
not doing a good job because they

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,280
shouldn't care it's how are you solving

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,860
some of your business problems but

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,320
whether things we hear so I hear there's

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,700
major cultural problems right that

00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,160
that's the elephant in the room with

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,650
this this changes a lot of things your

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,390
whole process for how you do release

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,430
management hardware provisioning

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,810
technology selection guess what these

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,760
might they might not be relevant anymore

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,000
you might literally have to change those

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,140
things and that is extremely disruptive

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,580
so I mean there's no sugarcoating of

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,380
that that's absolutely the case there's

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,030
change involved if you're not going to

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,490
change and you're gonna by pivotal Cloud

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,350
Foundry or app fog or active state or

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,520
any of these technologies and not change

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,930
frankly you might as well start over

00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,700
there's really and I'm probably screwing

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,100
my sales staff or pivotal with that but

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,780
you unless you have a real desire to

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,550
change that this is going to be left if

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,800
some weird siloed environment full of

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,390
random PHP apps at your interns wrote

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,700
like it's not going to be used as a

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,010
strategic asset if there's not a change

00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,920
around how do we focus on our apps and

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,940
our customer experience that deploy that

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,070
arguably you shouldn't have architects

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,810
at your company who don't code maybe

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,700
that's mildly controversial but you have

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,800
to build reference architectures that

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,530
can deploy an architect and innovate on

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,180
get out of I designed an awesome spec -

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:31,930
here's a reference application that we

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,700
can use to build something you've got a

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,170
datacenter full of stuff what am I

00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,430
supposed to do with all those that's one

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,170
of the first things we also here with

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,730
this is you're showing me the new

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,380
hotness I've got a data center of old

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,120
and busted I'm not making that

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,410
transition overnight so how am I

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,780
supposed to take advantage of any of

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,450
this and so some of that and the real

00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,940
big approach here is that how do I

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,770
embrace and extend right how do I take

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,110
advantage of these apps and wrap them up

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,150
a bit how do i put an api gateway on

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,820
there so that i don't keep writing api's

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,650
in Siebel I make sure that I wrap that

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,170
up so I can call through that through a

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,120
more scalable API tier how do I make

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,350
sure that my mobile applications again

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,210
might be working in a cloud foundry

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,100
environment and talk to some of these

00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,070
systems behind the scenes I don't have

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,870
to gut my system I can simply wrap it up

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,020
with some of this and and Dave McCrory

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,180
we used to work for VMware and talked on

00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,890
the DevOps cafe podcast a couple weeks

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,780
ago talked about how he at Warner

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,430
Brothers did some of this and his real

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,800
big point was that the data has to move

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,330
if you don't move the data to the pads

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,830
you're not gonna see the same adoption

00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,720
because that's where the apps have to

00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,250
need to talk to something so your data

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,290
needs to be accessible to your platform

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,150
as a service environment or else you're

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,010
not extending it far enough so thinking

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,110
about migrating that data making it

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,060
accessible at least to your PA's is a

00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,460
huge piece of how you are successful

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,480
with this sort of strategy the other

00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,890
piece is how do you integrate it with

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,900
the rest of your stuff including

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,970
infrastructures of service software as a

00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,040
service you have to make past part of

00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,170
your ecosystem if Cloud Foundry is just

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,060
sitting there with only your most modern

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,440
apps and it doesn't talk to everything

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,910
else you're not going to get the same

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,670
advantage you have to think about that

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,820
from day one

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,590
what the heck do I put this thing

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,120
I mean I've got lots of different ways I

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,460
can ship this right we hear about them

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,350
this week there's apparently 97 vendors

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,580
who sell Cloud Foundry in the foundry

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,470
area I didn't know about all of those

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,000
but it's awesome they write their

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,430
packaging this up and you can have it

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,780
hosted I can do private I can do public

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,520
I can do all these sort of ways to

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,160
consume platform as a service or Cloud

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,930
Foundry specifically I would choose one

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,670
of those and one of my implications if I

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:33,290
go all in on one of them have I

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,980
completely stuck myself with going

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,530
another way

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,430
and so we hear that a lot so what's the

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,900
answer there well there's no right

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,760
answer I guess that's the consulting

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,930
answer you know it's it's all of them

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,910
but the idea is that there is a

00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,680
progression here if you are just

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,230
introducing past to your environment I

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,300
don't know if going a full on premise

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,740
path is the right strategy right that's

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,140
a big commitment well you maybe haven't

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,510
embraced the organizational change the

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,000
technology pattern change and so that's

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,710
where public makes a lot of sense using

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,450
something like pivotal web services

00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,700
using something like a blog using these

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,350
sort of services bluemix others where I

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,090
want to try out these patterns I want to

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,220
build something secure that makes sense

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,500
and when I want to switch it over to

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,750
private where I can literally change my

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,760
endpoint and push the exact same app

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,650
from one place to the other that's crazy

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,690
great stuff I don't have to worry about

00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,700
that same level of lock-in so in this

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,380
case the key is is thinking about that

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,060
now private makes sense if you've got

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,160
regulatory stuff where it makes no sense

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,500
for you to stick your PCI data or your

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,840
patient data in a public cloud you might

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,520
say I don't trust that at all I have to

00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,070
run a private pass or at least a virtual

00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,520
private pass a hosted one okay makes

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,960
sense

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,820
likewise you this needs to be close to

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,710
your data again if you're trying to have

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,420
a public pass tunneling through and

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,370
accessing data over in your data center

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,230
3,000 miles away let me tell you you

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,000
will have a negative experience for your

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,440
users right so unless I'm going to

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,330
commit again to where my data is gonna

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,520
go I have to think about that my data

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,020
has to be wherever my pass is otherwise

00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,880
what's the point you're gonna have lousy

00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:04,010
er latency and performance you're not

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:06,200
gonna get the same benefit hey you're

00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,000
changing how I do config management you

00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,010
know I worked at an enterprise company a

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,380
very nice group of folks but they have a

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,910
big configuration management database

00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,220
that was always out-of-date but we

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,290
pretended it wasn't and it kept records

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,270
of apps and servers and owners and

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,649
whatever and it was you know it's a

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,959
fool's errand to keep that stuff up

00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:26,149
especially in this air in this era of I

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,220
can have instances that I'm adding and

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,389
tearing down in seconds well am I

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,040
supposed to track with that am i

00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:32,779
tracking the instance now am i trying to

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,459
track the server that stuff's irrelevant

00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,800
but how do you deal with that that's a

00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:38,899
big change from having a way to enter

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,079
and manage your configurations it feels

00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:43,790
like anarchy in this sort of pa's model

00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:45,499
so I guess my answer to that is you're

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,350
focusing on the app you're saying the

00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:50,059
app is the thing that matters so I have

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,769
a configuration via manifest that's

00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,269
what's awesome about this is when I'm

00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,369
deploying Cloud Foundry I'm getting

00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:57,589
runtime dependencies put on the box as

00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:59,360
far the build packs I'm deploying things

00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:01,910
with a manifest it says hook up to this

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,980
service call it this thing size it this

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,559
way check that thing into source control

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,420
now that's great now granted I can be a

00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,179
rebel as a developer and still scale it

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,949
via CF scale and break kind of that

00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:14,360
model of just using a manifest so you

00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:16,309
they still need some process in place

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,059
but the fact that I can source control

00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:19,670
my configs

00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:21,709
I can push that sort of thing through my

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:25,009
configuration is really the registry of

00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:26,959
apps that I've got I can do CF and list

00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:28,819
my apps CF apps see my apps see my

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,189
instances I don't have all this rigor

00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:32,749
and unnecessary process and ceremony

00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:33,980
around configuration management

00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:36,679
especially when it's wrong all the time

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,540
so thinking about how do I focus this on

00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,279
the app how do I have the system tell me

00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,029
it's state versus trying to manually

00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,029
keep things up to date

00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,870
how in the world do I integrate this

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,779
stuff you know I'm used to using my

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,449
VMware management tools I've got my own

00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:56,120
log processing tools that this is again

00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:58,279
some weird you know uncle that lives in

00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,569
my basement I don't know how to bring it

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,709
into the family I want to be part of the

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:02,179
family I know I integrate this thing

00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:04,069
that's a horrible analogy but you'll

00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:06,829
it's visceral you're thinking about it

00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:09,259
right now yeah you might be an uncle you

00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:11,629
might be that weird uncle not judging

00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:13,279
you but looked in the marketplace for

00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:15,620
some of this the CF marketplace this is

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,449
pretty neat stuff where I can extend it

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,100
right you over in the foundry are you've

00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,199
got companies like New Relic you have

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,730
others where I can extend and use some

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,529
of those toolings but I don't need

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,540
infrastructure management tooling like a

00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,639
console when I'm dealing with the pads

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,959
I don't log in and boot up a server I'm

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,420
not looking at its configuration

00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,740
settings I'm dealing at the a player so

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,209
some of that goes away but they're also

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,429
thinking about marketplace how do

00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:39,980
I append those services but also user

00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:42,259
provided services take your database and

00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,970
in Cloud Foundry exposed that as a

00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:46,129
marketplace service to your developers

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,139
treat that as a service catalog for your

00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:50,119
thing so all of a sudden now your

00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:52,369
private paths customers your custom you

00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:54,740
know users your public I'm accessing my

00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:57,019
internal systems as an attached service

00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,610
like I should be with 12 factor apps so

00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,319
being able to think of marketplace think

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,360
about services and not having my devs

00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,129
hard-coding connection strings to random

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,720
systems but treating it all as a

00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,720
services ecosystem is really powerful

00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:14,480
too much freedom it's it's dogs running

00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:16,279
in parks its developers or simply taking

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,980
over the world this is mayhem I can't

00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,629
tolerate this too much is going on here

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,459
developers are not the new king makers

00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:24,740
be quiet Stephen O'Grady and red Hmong

00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:27,199
people we hear that right that

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,499
developers are drunk with power this is

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,819
just simply giving them more liquor

00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:35,029
please don't tweet that that's that's a

00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:36,379
horrible way to say that so the answer

00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:38,240
that is that there are policies and

00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:40,129
constraints though there are you know I

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,410
can use my continuous integration my

00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:44,809
continuous deployment tools as part of a

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,939
past pipeline I can absolutely put some

00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:48,559
process there I have certain behavior

00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,360
that the platform does enforce right

00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,579
there's state management or there's

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,649
instance management I can't have too

00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,850
many instances I actually have limits to

00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,730
make sure my developer doesn't

00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,929
accidentally spin up 40,000 instances

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,329
and go away for the weekend and

00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:03,799
completely screw my bill I can actually

00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:06,199
make sure that I have some governance

00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,789
and policies around that all my configs

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,230
can go into source control it's not

00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:11,360
complete mayhem where it's coming from

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,370
my desktop computer or laptop or

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,380
whatever into the cloud I can source

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,329
control my configs I can maintain that

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,189
and I have this Service Catalog we just

00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,809
talked about so I can have this CF

00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:23,209
marketplace I can have these Service

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,370
Catalog items it's not mayhem now

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,839
conversely what we hear from developers

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,669
is you're from them you're putting me in

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,250
a cage I'm a peacock you have to let me

00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:33,830
fly you know that's absolutely something

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,360
we do hear from people it says like this

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,740
is too restrictive you're making me do

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,510
certain patterns I don't want to have to

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,549
do how come I can't get right into the

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,409
box I want to deploy my own react

00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:44,200
cluster in here whatever you're not

00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:46,490
letting me do that my PA's environment

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,679
we do hear that that's a real objection

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,310
so it's a little more of a dog in a

00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,170
fence

00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,700
all right not in a cage but you're in a

00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,370
bit of a sandbox if you're familiar with

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,350
the term the paradox of choice this idea

00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,000
of the psychological thing they did

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,380
where you have you know 30 jellies in

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,580
the supermarket and everyone looks at

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,560
them and no one buys anything because

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,240
they're overwhelmed you put out four and

00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,100
everyone buys them because I don't have

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,440
all these infinite choices to deal with

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,210
you know when I have so many ways to

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,340
implement a solution I end up being

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,900
paralyzed so sometimes having some

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,880
reasonable constraints is actually

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,830
really freeing because I'm not stuck

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,080
debating every possible solution I have

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,940
one way to deploy things in this sort of

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,980
thing now let me innovate in that

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,780
environment so some of this does fit

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,430
that way that you can do a good job talk

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,450
to almost any developer and the number

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,070
one thing they're gonna tell you they

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,290
have trouble with is getting access to

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,480
resources when you can give someone a

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,700
sandbox to run multi-language apps and

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,260
scale on demand that solves a lot of

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,820
problems and while that may not be

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,310
perfect and I may have to hook in

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,050
services for my own databases or my ELQ

00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,000
stack or whatever I want to do maybe I

00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,740
can't do everything but I can layer some

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,780
things in and the main problem I'm

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,520
trying to solve is get your apps to

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,110
market faster so your company makes more

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,090
money and you're growing and you're able

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,590
to be more agile it seems like a decent

00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:01,580
trade-off to say there are some

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,870
guardrails around your development so

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,480
you're making me change how my apps look

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,190
damn it they I've loved my client-server

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,870
stuff or I love just having my simple

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,060
two-tier stuff now you're telling me

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,880
this this random 12 factor stuff I don't

00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,020
know what that is why are you making me

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,700
change what I do and we do hear that

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,050
sometimes from development teams who are

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,660
comfortable with they're comfortable

00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,460
with their toolset see you know what the

00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,170
army of instance is right I mean the 12

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,330
pack their stuff is exciting but it is

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,950
absolutely about this now if you're

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,170
building any custom apps from this point

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,000
forward and not doing at least the

00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,920
principles of 12 factor wraps even if

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,870
you're not doing everyone you're doing

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,910
yourself a disservice and what are those

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,710
if you've all checked out the site 12

00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,690
Factor Ned was referred to in some of

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,760
the keynotes this is declared

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,530
dependencies this is network attached

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,060
services this is making sure that you

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,340
have services that can shut off

00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,900
instantly gracefully stand back up

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,300
gracefully it's making sure that you've

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,680
got things like good concurrency these

00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,910
are just good architecture design

00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,710
principles I don't care if you're in the

00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,240
cloud or not these are great in your

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,610
data center right it's gonna give you a

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,470
more micro services friendly DevOps

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,990
friendly

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,270
word bingo friendly flavor of your

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,159
applications and so it's a good pattern

00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,870
regardless no more snowflake servers

00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,580
right no more unique environments that

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,590
someone that's terrified to log into and

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,360
redeploy to this all gives you a nice

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,730
standard quick way to deploy to an

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,080
environment which is pretty powerful but

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,520
what does this require so what this

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,960
requires is that if you're any of those

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,700
folks who raised your hand saying I'm a

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,010
manager of devs or I'm a mustache

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,260
attending here and taking brochures you

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,830
have to give your team some help they

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,270
need training

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,789
clearly my pro lo-roll site training is

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,900
their best option but secondarily

00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:38,110
nothing nothing from you all that's

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,640
blank stares so you have that right but

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,470
get them a sandbox especially with

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,720
public pads now this is an incremental

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,360
slash meaningless cost make sure your

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,580
team has an effort or an ability to try

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,710
these things out you can't just say top

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,299
down here you're gonna start using a

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,370
pass it's not going to work what you

00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:55,720
need is developers to feel that pain and

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,730
suggest some things use these

00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,440
environments make them a stakeholder in

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,210
it and give them the tools to actually

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,070
try out these patterns use these

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,600
technologies that's the investment you

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:09,190
need to take if you're someone who has a

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,390
budget in your organization so I don't

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,610
know what the heck to put in the pass

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,799
right we hear this a lot you can sit in

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,360
this session and go not this session

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,679
because this one's you know very clear

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,030
of course but I might be in other

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,070
sessions where I'm looking going that's

00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,900
a weird scenario I can never copy my

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,090
company doesn't do next flexi style

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,190
stuff we don't have mobile apps because

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,750
I'm doing whatever my company how do I

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,220
start thinking about the right apps that

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,039
make sense from my pads and we get this

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,080
right there's lots of choices even us as

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,260
a company offer things like hosting or

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,460
bare metal or pads or virtual machines

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,990
how am I supposed to stick what where

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,730
and what seems like it's a lot of the

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,679
future is picking the right host for

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,690
each service each micro service whatever

00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,669
in your architecture there's gonna be

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,049
things that fit in mobile that might go

00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,240
in a pass there's gonna be things that

00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,559
might be io intensive the belong in a

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,270
physical machine there's things that

00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,520
need certain type levels of scale and a

00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,110
VM so sometimes it's not gonna be does

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,940
this whole app move it switch parts of

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,860
it move and as you look at the answer to

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,720
that it's things like greenfield apps

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,970
it's really hard to take existing apps

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,260
and completely refactor them for the

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,830
cloud sometimes you might say it's not

00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,409
worth it

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,850
right it's it's running fine here and I

00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:14,799
don't want to have to do the the work

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,370
necessary to switch it to app as model

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,260
that's fine there's companies here that

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,190
help you with that ultros and others who

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,750
could help you do some refactoring

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,500
that's great if you want to pull that

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:26,120
off API projects are great as we're

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,520
building more and more api's when I can

00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,110
have developers using whatever language

00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,680
they want you want to write API is in

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:35,360
Ruby and ojs and PHP and go I can put

00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,070
them all in the same darn place that's

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,020
that's amazing that I don't have to deal

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,630
with any problems there so have putting

00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,760
API gateways aggregate applications

00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,309
right do I want to invest more in that

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,660
PeopleSoft application or in that custom

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:49,429
app that someone wrote for me or do I

00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,410
want to build an aggregator app that

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:52,940
pulls data up and trigger some workflow

00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,040
and things like that so those make great

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,900
sense for PES if you're not running your

00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,090
dot-com sites in something like a pass

00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,340
where you need elasticity right any of

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,230
your brand sites ok companies I've

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,120
worked for we do these big bursts when

00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,010
they launch a product and have all the

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,650
server setup for that day one traffic

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,150
and then take their time decommissioning

00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,460
them all when you didn't need them after

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:16,040
day one in PES amazingly being able to

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,290
scale to 100 instances do your launch to

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,940
scale them right back down that's great

00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,280
stuff so any of your public facing

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,620
dot-com sites make a ton of sense for a

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,600
pass like this using things around

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,250
WordPress and blogs and open source

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,550
projects that you can run in these

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,500
environments also make a ton of sense as

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,510
you do start looking at your on-premises

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,670
app your check for suitability right can

00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,200
I tweak these a little bit for them to

00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,630
run in here and make sense is it just

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,850
some small changes to be more 12 factor

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,470
friendly and not have to write files to

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,210
the local file system which doesn't work

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,250
in Cloud Foundry can I take advantage of

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,380
those sorts of things versus necessarily

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,940
gutting it and starting over if not

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:57,740
target more of your greenfield

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:59,270
development here so covered a few things

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,220
here I mean really hopefully the point

00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,230
is is that platform as a service is

00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,790
absolutely a change in mindset if you're

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,740
not thinking about the organizational

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,210
change you're gonna struggle but if you

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,200
do if you can take advantage of it

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,240
there's a lot of cool things you're able

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,179
to do here by having a much more

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,740
adaptable application ecosystem so take

00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:17,390
advantage of some of that try some of

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,670
the sandboxes don't necessarily feel

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,110
like you have to be all-in and invest in

00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,000
something major maybe you try some

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,070
things out in the public cloud see if

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,970
they're the right fit but question you

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,890
know answer some of those questions

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,470
head-on this stuff can be tricky

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,539
but it's also super exciting and dynamic

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,830
if you get it right so I'll be at the

00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:35,210
CenturyLink booth out there in the

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,039
foundry area if you have any questions

00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,780
feel free to come up hopefully you're

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,220
somewhere exciting in your journey with

00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:44,350
all of this and if you have any

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,350
questions feel free to pop up and ask

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:52,349
