	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
you know those days where you throw a

00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:08,730
party and you're wondering if people

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:12,540
will show up and then they all do it's

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,660
kind of like that moment so I'm Abbey

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,850
Kearns and I'm with pivotal and

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,580
diversity and diversity and Technology

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,080
and diversity and open source

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,070
communities is really important to me

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,869
and Sam gave me the opportunity to turn

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,689
this event into something a little bit

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:34,860
more and I'm so excited that everyone

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:37,050
showed up we have an amazing agenda for

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,440
today we're gonna start off with Robin

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,329
Houser Reynolds the filmmaker behind the

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,309
new documentary code debugging the

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:51,000
gender gap Wow and then we're going to

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:54,210
turn that into a panel which I am going

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,699
to host and moderate on diversity in the

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,379
open source community we're gonna ask

00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,820
I'm gonna ask a few questions of the

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,280
panelists but then I really want to open

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,290
it up to the room so be thinking about

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,080
questions that you can ask we're gonna

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,130
have microphones running around to

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,189
really make this an interactive

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,850
conversation with the panelists and with

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,850
Robin on how we can really sponsor more

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,619
diversity and really as Sam talked a lot

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,350
about this morning turn this into a

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,960
listening culture so with that

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,350
Robin I'm gonna hand this off to you to

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:34,020
start your

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:34,020
[Applause]

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,480
thank you so much thanks to Cloud

00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,820
Foundry and two pivotal pivotal labs for

00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,570
having me here first thing I want to say

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,960
is that I am NOT a woman in tech I'm a

00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,850
filmmaker and we would not have been

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,210
able to make this film if it weren't for

00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,190
all of you so I just want to point out

00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:05,530
Stacy Hartman producer is here with us

00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:07,930
today in the spring of 2013 my daughter

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,520
was in college and she called home she

00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,260
was studying computer science and she

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,210
started to express some doubts about her

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,520
ability to actually major in the subject

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,070
she said mom they're all men in the

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,750
class there's only one other girl they

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,670
know so much more than I do about it

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,660
even in these prerequisites classes she

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,640
goes I think I'm failing when in fact

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,150
she was getting a B and after about four

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,730
classes she did in fact drop out at the

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,720
same time though there were these

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,520
international newspapers that were

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,390
coming out that were talking things like

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,310
this you know

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,930
sorry grads if you don't have a computer

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,820
science degree or at least some

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,330
knowledge of computer science good luck

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,340
getting a job and I was fascinated by

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,250
the fact that there seemed to be so many

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,500
jobs lucrative jobs and yet it looked

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,200
like it was really difficult for young

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,209
women to be studying this in college so

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,080
then the White House issued a report

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:04,660
that said by 2020 there would be 1.4

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,420
million computer science jobs in the US

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,489
alone and only 400,000 computer

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,100
scientists graduating so that's 1

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,820
million unfilled jobs that's 5 years

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,640
from now so why is this supply and

00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,620
demand so skewed well it turns out we're

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,570
missing half the population this is an

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,450
incredible room of very talented tech

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,570
women but as you probably very well know

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:32,769
we're missing people of color and women

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:35,080
in the industry if you look carefully at

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,930
some of these companies Google Facebook

00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,590
Yahoo Apple the highest one which is

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,550
Apple is 20% women if you want to look

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,370
at people of color

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:50,950
it's even worse Latinos hold less than

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:54,380
8% of tech jobs and blacks less than 7%

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,880
so the face of tech is really sort of

00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:05,650
this your average white male

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:07,879
[Music]

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,299
one of my favorite quotes is bite from

00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,010
Gloria Steinem who says that women have

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,769
always been an equal part of the past

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,750
just not an equal part of history and I

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:20,900
think this is absolutely especially true

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,669
in the history of computing women

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,400
pioneers in early computing have all

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:27,139
been forgotten from history I mean how

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,009
many people in this room but to most

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:29,780
audiences

00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:33,380
most people don't know who Ada Lovelace

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,910
was Ada Lovelace was Lord Byron's

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,259
daughter and she worked with Charles

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:42,740
Babbage on the analytical machine Ada

00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:45,050
Lovelace was a mathematician who wrote a

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,110
first and very important description of

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,000
Babbage's analytical engine she's often

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,500
considered to be the first computer

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,900
programmer you probably have heard of

00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,729
you probably all know Grace Hopper Grace

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,729
Hopper invented the first compiler that

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:04,160
was designed for the first programming

00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:07,550
language Shearer knew she and her team

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,919
also coined the term debugged she was

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,320
working on one of her early machines and

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,139
found this loss and in her lab notebooks

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,180
from this period we have this

00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:21,470
description of the very first computer

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,000
bug and it's right into the notebook and

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,479
debugging of course is one of the things

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,539
that's so hard about programming

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:31,760
these are little clips from the film so

00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:33,440
interestingly enough in 1984 there were

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,090
more women in the field than there are

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,560
now

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,870
and I think the real question is why is

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,240
it so important that we have women and

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:45,050
diversity at the coding level and

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,120
sometimes I think when some of the best

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,620
ways to talk about that is to show some

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,060
of the blunders and some of the problems

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,760
that have happened when there have

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,289
haven't been women at the table my

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,639
favorite example of course is the air

00:05:54,289 --> 00:06:00,680
bag the air bag was the first air bag

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,690
that came out actually killed women and

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,060
children and the reason for that is

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,919
because it was designed to fit the specs

00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,909
of the average engineer on the team and

00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:13,580
that person was a 30 something year old

00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:16,790
white male

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,830
when voice activation was first

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:22,530
engineered it was tested with male

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,930
voices and therefore women's voices

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,000
couldn't be heard and it failed there in

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,460
navigation systems and cars and

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,590
elsewhere and then when video tracking

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:41,220
was aligned with voice activation women

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:42,750
couldn't be seen that's just one of my

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,050
favorite graphics from the film so I had

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,460
to show it to you as the greater

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,920
diversity really leads to greater

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,320
innovation products that serve greater

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,280
breath of humanity this is one of my

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,950
favorite examples buscando was made by a

00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,080
group of Latina women for Central

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,730
American refugee children and the idea

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,700
is that it's an app that connects

00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,670
refugees with social services to provide

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,620
food clothing shelter and host families

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,870
to a lot of the Latin American children

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,390
that were coming across the border and

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,010
act like this it's hard to think that

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,750
this might have been thought up of if

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,390
you were just with a homogeneous group

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,130
of coders in Palo Alto right so this is

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,920
the type of app that's that's coming out

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,420
that's really helping people but it

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:34,470
would take someone to know that there is

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:36,510
that need on the team one of my favorite

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,420
things to talk about when we talk about

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,250
the importance of having women on on a

00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,440
team is something that is called the

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,360
female factor some of you might know

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,300
this it was published actually in the

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,460
Harvard Business Review in 2011 and what

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:55,320
it states is that regardless of the

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:58,710
individual IQs of people on a team the

00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,260
collective IQ of the group increases

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,920
when you add a woman and the more women

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:07,050
on the team the higher the collective IQ

00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,300
so basically a grip with more women is

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,900
going to be smarter than a group of all

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,880
men regardless of individual IQs so this

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,010
is a room full of women primarily I know

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,470
that you get that with me I'm just

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:23,220
saying it's it's actually documented I

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:25,140
think it's fascinating so what's going

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,729
on why aren't there more women and

00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,419
people of color in

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:32,669
science/engineering we have found that

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:38,250
the biggest culprit is stereotype and

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:41,219
mindsets this is Jocelyn Gould sorry

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:45,420
Jocelyn Goldfine from Facebook formally

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:46,440
she's a senior VP of engineering and

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,860
this is what she has to say on the

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,839
matter

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,430
women don't enter computer science

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,620
because they look at it and they see

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,000
that there's so few women there and it

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,240
is surrounded with so many stereotypes

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,649
and so much messaging that this is a

00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,910
place for men but this is not a place

00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,790
for women that this is not a field for

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,980
women and I think that that sort of that

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,620
set of beliefs is not sort of

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,240
superficial I think it starts very very

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,160
young it starts with the books that we

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,680
read our children when I open Curious

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,899
George and every scientist and doctor is

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,709
a man when the only female characters

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:22,019
are nurses and moms which are wonderful

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,339
professions but do not represent the

00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,699
full spectrum of all the things women

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,959
can do it sends a very one-sided message

00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,519
that this is a set of things that men

00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:32,699
are good at and women are not good at

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,860
and and I think children internalize

00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:38,550
those beliefs early and children want to

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,220
conform and there's also the myth of the

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,680
boy genius the myth that you have to be

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,110
antisocial nerdy wear glasses

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,029
hoodies want to stay up all night and be

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:52,170
in your basement drinking Red Bull and

00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:53,040
eating stale pizza Debbie sterling from

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,829
goldieblox

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,329
said some interesting things about this

00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:00,720
well I think that engineering has a

00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:02,339
marketing problem I think that growing

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,930
up as a little girl I certainly wasn't

00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:10,260
interested in it I pictured engineers as

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:13,589
nerdy guys who have no friends who sit

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:17,610
alone all day grokking on algorithms who

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:20,639
are geniuses and I think it's it's

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:23,010
incredibly intimidating especially for a

00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,630
girl who doesn't see other women in the

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:30,120
field and frankly there just are a few

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:31,760
women girls don't want to be the smart

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,959
girl some of the research that we've

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,100
discovered and what we that we've been

00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,769
learning about and people that we've

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,089
talked to talk about how in 7th and 8th

00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,860
grade girls stop raising their hands

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,240
they don't want to be the smart girl

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,309
they want to be the cute girl they want

00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,160
to be the popular girl and something

00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:52,079
about our culture is telling them that

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,569
it's not okay to be the smart girl I

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,240
think part of the culprit here is pop

00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:00,370
culture it's Hollywood it's a lot of the

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,050
messages as as joseline said in our

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,870
books but here's an interesting scene

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,610
that sort of personifies this on October

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,699
3rd excuse me what day it was

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:15,309
it's October 3rd two weeks later we

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:19,050
spoke again yeah but I wanted things to

00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:22,240
move faster so I followed my instincts

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,980
I'm totally lost can you help me but I

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,600
wasn't lost yeah I knew exactly what

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,889
Melbourne was talking about it's a

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:33,430
factorial so you multiply each one by n

00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:37,089
is that the summation yeah there's same

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:45,670
thing wrong you're so wrong Thanks yeah

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:48,610
I get it now so it's education the

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:51,249
answer do we need to start incorporating

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,959
computer science in testicles and I will

00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:56,410
tell you that from our research yes

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,819
absolutely making computer science

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,670
mandatory in the schools and even

00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:02,850
introducing it early on in elementary

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,870
school with some of these amazing

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,779
programs that are coming out like

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,550
codable and you saw Goldie Blox little

00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:14,139
bits different things that kids can play

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:17,050
with that are gender neutral I think is

00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:21,269
a real start to building the foundation

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,269
of understanding the logic behind coding

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,850
but it's it's difficult to get this into

00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:27,999
the school and of course there's

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:30,370
resistance from a lot of educators where

00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:34,809
do they fit it in is that a is that a

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:37,300
math is it a language is it is it a

00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:39,550
science and the question that we hear

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,079
from really the answer the best answer

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,550
that we've gotten from Megan Smith in

00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,579
the White House who now as you all know

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,709
is this the CTO of the United States in

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,819
a wonderful role model is that it

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:50,769
actually she really should be

00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:52,940
incorporated into all different

00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:56,300
classrooms it can be used to

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,980
data sets in science class it can be

00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,990
part of mathematics but it really needs

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,490
to be incorporated into all aspects of

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,020
the curriculum the same way it's

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,460
integrated into all aspects of our life

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,870
whether it's in our pockets with our

00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,670
cell phone whether it's in our

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,730
navigation system in our car or in the

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,640
hospitals Chris demarks is on the board

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:16,310
of nCWIT and she speaks a little bit to

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,780
this a broader issue I think which is

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,630
that computer science is not in the

00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,790
schools and I think that if it was done

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,500
well and part of the curriculum and by

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,300
that I don't mean becoming comfortable

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,190
technology I mean really creating

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,410
technology innovating giving them the

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,280
tools that they actually can create

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,140
these that are meaningful and relevant

00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,450
to their lives I actually think that

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,640
would increase math interest right

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,720
because there's sort of those all become

00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,550
a little more interesting a little

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,800
cooler so I think a sort of broad-based

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,870
national curriculum around computer

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:51,620
science could have these other really

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:52,910
positive effects just do that just so

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,800
that she doesn't get mad at me with that

00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,650
last frame that's holding up there I

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,580
think that getting into the schools is

00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:03,230
enormous ly important and you know

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,670
hopefully there will be a move in in

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,460
that direction I will tell you that

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,260
we've been really fortunate in that so

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,870
far the documentary that premiered in

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,530
Tribeca has attracted the attention of

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:17,210
some of some of our government officials

00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,100
people that are trying to get this into

00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,570
schools and we have a amazing

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,630
opportunity to actually screen the

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:27,650
documentary for the State Department in

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:30,560
DC also on Capitol Hill for Congress and

00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,890
in Geneva at the UN so hopefully this

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,160
will help spark the

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:38,480
[Applause]

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,370
so if you can make it beyond the

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,100
stereotypes and over the hurdles of the

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,210
education system and into the workplace

00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,850
you then have to face another challenge

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:49,040
which you all know better than I do

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,550
which is dealing with startup culture

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,150
and the misogynistic behavior that goes

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,280
on there

00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,320
Julian Horvath you might all recognize

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,980
from github this is what she has to say

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,040
about it

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:04,100
our startups benefit from protecting

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,590
their tribe and if you if you declare

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,600
yourself an outsider of that tribe the

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,950
smartest thing for them to do from a

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,170
business perspective is to get rid of

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,030
you the women are kind of born inside

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,890
like we don't have an option and it's

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,420
being me the cultural other in that

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,610
situation the same thing with minorities

00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,920
there a lot of sexism and racism attack

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:26,630
is actually blatant it's not malicious

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,010
but it's from a it's from those actions

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,350
and those things being pot like

00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:39,080
reinforced with their own success and

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:40,340
with money so what can we do in our view

00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,130
there are several things that need to

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,670
happen we need to change mindsets so we

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,110
need to change the stereotype of a coder

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,910
the best way to do this is to have more

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,590
female role models and more people of

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,900
color having Megan Smith in the White

00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:57,400
House as a start it's wonderful to have

00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,810
a woman we need more women role models

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,450
Traci Chow has been fabulous you know

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,280
her from from Pinterest there are role

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,220
models in this room we really need

00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,400
people to step out and and have their

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,440
voice heard and their faces seen so that

00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,240
people and pute children and people of

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,980
color can see somebody in the industry

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,840
that looks like them we also need to

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,130
make managed school CS mandatory in

00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,190
schools we've already discussed that

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:27,200
that takes a while we're behind the

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,200
United States is really behind in this

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,180
way even the UK just said that they are

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,380
now making it obligatory in all schools

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,950
starting and thinking in two or three

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:39,380
years interestingly enough Cuba per

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,910
capita graduates more computer science

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,260
majors than we do there quite a number

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,380
of countries that are ahead of us in

00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,579
this way and then we need to disrupt

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:51,699
startup culture

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:53,980
this is a clip from a film that is came

00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:55,929
out fairly recently Cloudy with a Chance

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,749
of Meatballs and I think that this is

00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:00,670
it's a start right it's one way that's

00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:03,999
showing that okay Hollywood can try to

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:07,360
change the perception that a woman who

00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,230
is smart and interested in Sciences can

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,010
actually be cool

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:14,350
so cello cry right right it's a solid

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,059
it's a liquid it's a viscoelastic

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:22,000
polymer made of polypeptide chains but

00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:24,699
you eat it I mean it tastes good why do

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,449
you do that do what say something super

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:31,899
smart and then bail from it when I was a

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:34,510
little girl I wore a ponytail I had

00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:36,519
glasses and I was totally obsessed with

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:39,340
the science of whether other girls

00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:43,809
wanted a Barbie I wanted a Doppler

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:46,389
weather radar mm turbo and I still need

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:48,309
these glasses but I never wear them

00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll bet you look great with glasses on

00:17:48,309 --> 00:18:02,560
I'm really big oh whoa what nothing

00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:04,560
wait is it jello scrunchie

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:08,580
[Music]

00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:11,559
and now the reveal

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:23,899
[Music]

00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:25,519
Wow I mean you're okay before but now of

00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:27,230
course interesting that the stereotype

00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:31,909
still has to have glasses I don't know

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:35,389
why that is so now I'm gonna play with

00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:36,710
you play for you rather our trailer for

00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:38,269
the actual film a lot of what you've

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,529
seen today is not in the film these are

00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:42,109
just some outtakes and things that I

00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:44,899
think are interesting perspectives on it

00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:46,909
but the film is on the film festival

00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:48,649
circuit so right now we're just having

00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:53,539
private screenings to certain companies

00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:56,450
in certain places and will be coming to

00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:59,480
the Bay Area in October we just

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:02,509
premiered at Tribeca and then we are on

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,580
our way to AFI which is in Washington DC

00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:08,419
which is exciting for us to get exposure

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:10,820
there and we'll let you know keep an eye

00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:12,529
on our on our website and you'll be able

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,639
to tell it's code documentary calm you

00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:21,919
can see where other screenings are as

00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:24,019
they pop up there will be 1.4 million

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,359
jobs by 2020 in the computing related

00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:28,039
field less than 29 percent of them are

00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,450
gonna be filled by Americans and less

00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,639
than three percent of that 29 percent

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,690
are gonna be women I don't think our

00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:34,940
engineering

00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,500
meritocracy being excellent or being

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,540
good at your job isn't enough if you're

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,100
a woman in fact the sort of phenomenon

00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:43,340
of the programmer has really interested

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,680
me programmer programmer program it's

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,960
hard to encourage more women to come

00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,000
into an environment that will sexually

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,410
harass them and not fund up as soon as a

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,270
woman gets introduced it's like blood in

00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,340
the water when companies started putting

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,080
these full diversity disclosure reports

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,080
out there it became very obvious while

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:03,130
there really is a problem this thing

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,420
that we need to be trying to address

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,590
women would apply in their programmers

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,410
they've been written out of history

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,850
unfortunately Grace Hopper came up with

00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:20,300
the concept of real programming

00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:21,710
language's coatings magic the same way

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,030
that everyone should know a little bit

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,740
about law and everyone should know a

00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,000
little bad about economics you probably

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,800
should know a little bit about computer

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,230
science growing up I was actually a

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,360
system kid I didn't know that I could

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,100
learn how to code like so quickly the

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,780
reason that there's a gap is actually

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:47,240
related to some really real structural

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:50,450
factors most students have no exposure

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,930
to programming computer science should

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,880
be a requirement in all public schools

00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:58,220
this is a Rosie the Riveter moment

00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,810
because the jobs are here and we don't

00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,320
have the workers to fill them for the

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:06,080
digital revolution to truly be great it

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,090
can't just be for a certain set of

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,830
people I'm hopeful because I think that

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,690
the tech industry could move the fastest

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,910
if we see the problem we can debug it

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:17,440
this is our country our cities our

00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,440
communities our children our code

00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:49,799
debunking the gender gap thank you very

00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:52,289
much Thank You Robin that was an amazing

00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:54,899
introduction to the conversation we're

00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:56,519
gonna have here today I don't know if I

00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:59,639
can add anything else on to that other

00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:01,619
than color commentary but I did want to

00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:03,659
bring up our panelists for today and

00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:06,659
really open it up for the conversation

00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:09,149
around diversity and particularly at

00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,969
here at Cloud Foundry summit diversity

00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:14,429
in an open-source software community so

00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:21,839
our first panelist is Cornelia Davis

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:25,769
from pivotal she's the director of

00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:30,379
platform engineering at pivotal second

00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:30,379
panelist is Malini Bandaru from Intel

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,810
the architect an engineering manager

00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:41,430
with the open-source technology Center

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:48,600
at Intel Gerald Chamberlin from

00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:52,050
Capgemini she's the group VP and global

00:22:48,600 --> 00:23:05,520
partner executive and made amazing time

00:22:52,050 --> 00:23:07,380
from SFO Eileen Evans from HP vice

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,920
president and deputy general counsel a

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,350
cloud computing and open source and then

00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:19,470
finally Rachel Thank You Rachel

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:22,200
rinette's from IBM distinguished

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,590
engineer as well as CTO of the bluemix

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,840
garage and Robyn I don't know if you

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:30,720
want to come back up as well Robyn's

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,220
gonna sit up here and be our six

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,380
panelists and also be available to

00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,380
answer questions about the documentary I

00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,710
don't want to take up to my too much

00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,680
time with an introduction but I did want

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:49,920
to tie a lot of what you talked about

00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:53,030
Robyn as well as what Sam talked a lot

00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,030
about in his keynote this morning

00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,300
continuous innovation is the key to

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,040
Cloud Foundry the community the platform

00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,480
and what we all want to hope to

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,720
accomplish with the platform in the

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:10,020
future and as Robyn really hit home with

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,240
the metrics and the data points the only

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,920
way to do that is through a diversity in

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,390
the community we're only going to

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,820
achieve that excellence in that

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,920
acceleration if our community is diverse

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,430
and is listening to all the voices

00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,560
equally and with that I really want to

00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,930
open it up to the panelists and then

00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,910
eventually to the room to really talk

00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:32,780
about that and what does that mean how

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:36,720
do we become more diverse how do we

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:39,030
really enable a diverse participation in

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,940
the community that right now and it's

00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:44,340
been pointed out we are minorities and

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,720
how do we really take that and turn that

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,490
into a bigger moment

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,980
and a bigger foothold in a community

00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:54,940
that really needs the level of diversity

00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:59,050
that we can bring so I want to start

00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:00,220
with kind of a generic question a little

00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,110
bit but I really liked some of the

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,320
points that Robin hit on is what is

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:07,120
diversity look like and what is that

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,270
what do what are we going to say when

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,770
we're diverse and what is that how does

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:15,460
that manufacture itself in an

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:26,050
open-source community and I'll open it

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:28,600
up to the panelists yeah that's true

00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:30,730
that's true I mean I don't have the

00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,120
answer and I don't think that there are

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:37,780
specific answers to any of this but

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,430
certainly diversity certainly looks a

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,590
lot more like this room that's for sure

00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:52,600
that's that's very very cool it does

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:54,400
actually yeah there there I would beg to

00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,080
differ that it's not diverse because I

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,150
see a lot of diversity out here that

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:04,720
isn't gen gender diversity but there's a

00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:08,230
lot of diversity in this room understood

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:12,250
actually more than half understood but I

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:14,080
think that certainly that this

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,510
discussion is actually the point it's

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,780
not just gender diversity it's there's

00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:24,340
diversity across the board and I think

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:27,250
that there's there's diversity in sexual

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:30,010
orientation and ethnic background in

00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,690
cultural backgrounds and socioeconomic

00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,540
backgrounds and all of those things and

00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,830
they all need to be to be heard and one

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,660
of the things that I like that Sam

00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,820
talked about it and he only said it very

00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,860
briefly was he said about listening and

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,170
one of the things that I learned when I

00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:50,110
was teaching back in graduate school was

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:54,010
when you ask are there any questions you

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:56,980
wait and you wait longer than you think

00:26:54,010 --> 00:27:00,070
it's comfortable to wait because there's

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,760
always that voice that might just speak

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,680
up

00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,800
when you're really truly listening and I

00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,150
think that that's a big part of it I

00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,710
want to add to what you're saying

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:11,470
because I think it's very interesting

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,030
how we define diversity I work for an

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,340
international company that's based in

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:18,460
Paris and diversity is an American

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,500
working for the company suggestion I've

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,600
just learnt but I've just I'm just

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,760
kidding but to the point I think it's

00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,010
having different skill sets so I think

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,050
as we start to get more involved in the

00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,490
world of technology not everybody has to

00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:33,130
graduate from a school with an

00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:36,130
engineering or a programming degree

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:39,150
there may be some people with a degree

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:42,130
in human resources or in the area of

00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,620
English that can add capability and a

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,390
different point of view into what we're

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,670
trying to do they may not be the coder

00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,500
but they can be providing a different

00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:54,210
point of view so that it gets more

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,210
interesting with those those Minds

00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,870
you know kind of going to the idea of

00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,210
what can we do about it

00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:03,420
one of the things that that we've done

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,460
at HP and we've done this not only

00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,950
amongst our at you know via HP we've

00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,470
also done it by participating in other

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:13,570
organizations that sponsor diversity we

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:16,780
launched an a an open source for women

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,670
program last fall and we had such a

00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,750
great response from it we initially

00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,190
thought maybe let's try this as a

00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,890
one-time thing but the response was

00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,870
overwhelmingly positive so we are in the

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,640
process of launching a second version of

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,290
this but I think those kinds of things

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,240
where we can sort of think of ideas and

00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,280
thoughts on what we can do to help bring

00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,840
in the the diversity and here it's

00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,490
specifically gender diversity that we

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,750
were focused on we were sort of we've

00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,670
got our heads together said let's focus

00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,720
on this because we noticed it was a

00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,800
problem with an openstack

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
in particularly that was the one we

00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,340
first noticed and then we just have been

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,340
broadening it and trying to expand it

00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,660
but let me ask you guys a question and

00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,250
I'm doing this to illustrate a point can

00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:59,090
you put up your hands if you're from the

00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:01,520
Bay Area okay all right so maybe about

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,530
if they'll leave your hands up please so

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:08,630
about a third of you can you put down

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:10,280
your hands if you're under 50 you see my

00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,890
point there's a lot of different kinds

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,110
of diversity so it just is your point

00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,240
Cornelia ray you can't something about

00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:20,420
in here in the valley I'm in the valley

00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,180
there's a huge amount of ageism that is

00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,980
not and that's not as rampant outside

00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,930
the valley but here and where they're

00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,520
the strong startup communities it is a

00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:32,870
huge issue because it does you know

00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,660
folks with more maturity and more

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:37,730
experience bring more maturity and help

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:40,040
to elevate some of these discussions and

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:44,540
just in general add another dimension of

00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:47,690
diversity that's a very good point for

00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,370
me it's also diversity if we respect the

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,290
fact that they have different you know

00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,690
important issues in their life at this

00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,980
point if you're a mother with young kids

00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,320
you don't want to say I'm gonna be there

00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:00,290
14-hour days and sometimes we have to

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,820
teach our male managers that's not what

00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,620
you're looking for that's not commitment

00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,960
for you make sure they can do a good

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,220
eight to nine hour day of solid work and

00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,510
then you're happy to have such an

00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:13,100
employee it's about different points in

00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,320
your life I mean last week I was just

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,880
diagnosed with thyroid cancer so I have

00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,490
to take a couple of weeks off I'm not

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,900
sick but people are are it automatically

00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,580
said oh there's something wrong with you

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,650
there's nothing wrong with me I have to

00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,080
go through a treatment and then I'm back

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,580
so I mean it's not just about children

00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,170
it's about points in time in our life

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,150
that we have to really deal with and

00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,680
share with people so that they

00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,300
understand that when you're open and

00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,070
honest that the world will understand

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,340
where you are and you can maintain your

00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,340
power

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,630
well actually I want to take that in

00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:53,440
to go to a point Malini that you said

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,690
earlier is you know how do we do more

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,150
than pay lip service to diversity you

00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,010
know with Intel investing over three

00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:03,010
hundred million dollars and really

00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:05,860
building out a diverse workforce how how

00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:09,910
do we do more and how do we really turn

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:12,100
this into a movement so first and

00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,960
foremost you know you can't have

00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,690
diversity you can't have at least gender

00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,370
diversity unless you interview them so

00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,920
one of the things we're doing is anytime

00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:23,950
we have a job opening we conscientiously

00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:26,110
say where are the women here you know

00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,910
bring them in HR or let's go recruit

00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,470
from different places so we at least

00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,970
consider them because they might not

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:34,000
have even heard about the job the

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,710
network might be small that said another

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,170
thing is now we're actually consciously

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,330
looking has there been some unconscious

00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:42,970
bias we're not even saying someone is

00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,620
doing it intentionally but there are

00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,150
just certain adjectives you might use

00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,190
with respect to a woman oh she's

00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:51,250
friendly or she's considerate or she's

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,990
kind or whatever even if she does ten

00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:55,540
times the work you know so at least

00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,490
twice the work of male does and there's

00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,830
also some amount of paranoia whether you

00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:02,260
want to accept it or not like men are

00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,900
concerned it does gonna think about

00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,080
women promote them maybe maybe I won't

00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,910
get my promotion so we're consciously

00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,640
trying to address that have discussions

00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:14,320
and you know we might it's just nice

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,880
that they air it it might come up at

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,010
lunch and we talk about it and say hey

00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,570
no look at this you have women you're

00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,700
you're having conversations with me

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,590
we've worked together on a pattern it

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,720
just means we're just as intelligent as

00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:29,020
you and maybe we've been overlooked for

00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,080
promotions so we're trying to deal with

00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:35,080
this head-on at interviews at lunch

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,210
table discussions ask those questions

00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:41,320
and make sure people are heard and

00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:42,970
recognized now one thing that something

00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,950
that we learned Etsy is a company that's

00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:47,470
really done a good job with bringing in

00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:51,100
more diversity and their numbers are I

00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:52,660
think they went from 8% to 31% in or

00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,220
actually lower than that but in over

00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,779
five years which is impressive

00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,559
and one of the things they did was think

00:32:55,779 --> 00:33:01,629
they made their interview panel more

00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:03,190
diverse in other words they made they

00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:06,340
brought on women and people from

00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,320
different socioeconomic backgrounds onto

00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:11,259
the interview panel because we all tend

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,139
to hire people like us and so the more

00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:15,129
diverse the interview panel the more

00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:16,809
opportunity you have and also for the

00:33:15,129 --> 00:33:18,940
interviewee if they're able to identify

00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:20,559
with somebody on the panel that reminds

00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,759
them of them they're gonna have more

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:27,940
interest in joining that company in IBM

00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:30,610
we have basically proactive programs for

00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,620
diversity where we identify top talent

00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,690
people and they arrive in the case of

00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,669
women they're brought in they're given

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:39,100
an intense mentoring session with

00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:40,960
executives and you know a plans are put

00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,549
together in terms of what are the

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,049
activities that they need to be doing

00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,899
what is the mentorship what are the

00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:50,169
opportunities to progress their careers

00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:53,110
so it's a very proactive very directed

00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:55,059
program to make sure and it's

00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,799
particularly targeted at elevating

00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:58,720
people to the really the more senior

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,480
levels and then of course we have other

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,940
programs as well

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,110
HP what we've done is we feel fortunate

00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,450
because where I'm in a unique situation

00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,700
the sense that HP has a woman CEO and a

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,470
woman CFO so we have Meg Whitman and

00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,819
Cathy let's Jack which is for me it's

00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:15,339
the first time I've been in a company

00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:17,079
where there are women in both of those

00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:19,690
positions so it's pretty exciting I

00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:21,730
think in its its permeates down

00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,800
throughout the organization as well it

00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,869
seems as if every business group that we

00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,839
have and every function we have really

00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:30,369
focuses on on diversity and they look at

00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:32,409
it more broadly than just gender

00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,780
diversity but they do have proactive

00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:37,240
programs in place for specific groups

00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,609
and organizations yeah and there's no

00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,960
question that proactivity I love the

00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:42,669
fact that everybody's talking about it

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,649
because it's nothing's gonna happen

00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:47,319
unless we actually make it a point to

00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,720
make something happen I talk to a lot of

00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:51,849
people who say yeah you know that is a

00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,159
problem but I don't get the candidates

00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:55,659
or recently I was chatting with somebody

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,670
who said you know we'd like to have more

00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:59,410
women speak this conference but we're

00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,839
just not getting submissions from women

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,060
and the answer is well are you trying to

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,190
get submissions from women because you

00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,260
do need to go out of your way

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,210
a bit and I think one of the best

00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:14,140
examples that even came up at the panel

00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:16,300
at the the Tribeca premiere one of the

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,380
the best examples is title nine in

00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:22,569
college athletics where extraordinarily

00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,390
unpopular by some in some circles a

00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:27,790
great number of circles initially when

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:30,940
it first started but there's no question

00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:33,099
that it has empowered not just young

00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,020
women to come in and do athletics in

00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:38,140
college but it's it's empowered women

00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:41,980
generally just because of that change in

00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:44,920
culture that women can be now seen in

00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,020
competing at the athletic level in

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,970
college and in its even increase the

00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,790
number of women who are competing at the

00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,680
professional level that empowers even

00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,270
young girls to think about what can I do

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,500
that's something that I can do so

00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:01,630
proactive putting putting up rules in

00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,310
place in your corporation and maybe even

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:07,960
broader than that I think is a really a

00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:10,839
critical part of the equation when we

00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,420
write up these you know descriptions for

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,270
jobs don't make it like excellent in

00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:18,430
ABCDE F and G because women if they're

00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:20,980
not you know in all of them they might

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,450
not even apply but men typically apply

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,670
even if they're good in one or two

00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,530
things so that's one way of not pushing

00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:28,720
them away and then I have one more

00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,819
comment it's on mentoring mentoring I I

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,160
hear that everywhere we really need

00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:35,530
sponsors so if you have the opportunity

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,720
to be a sponsor please be a sponsor and

00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,339
sponsors very different from a Mendozas

00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,470
know it's good if you do this it's good

00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:43,540
if you would do that a sponsor says I

00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:45,760
know you can do this I believe in you

00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,869
and here's this opportunity go apply or

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,569
I'm gonna push you up for this

00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:52,119
opportunity be that sponsor if you have

00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:55,930
that opportunity and then if you get

00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:57,640
that and you move up pay back later no

00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:01,710
it's okay that's right I just have to

00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,579
steal from everyone so that I can see

00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,890
first of all I want to just make a

00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:08,230
comment about sponsorship I worked at

00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,180
EMC for 14 years and when I wanted to

00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,700
change jobs and move to a different

00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:15,460
company they sponsored me so the

00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,890
executives two of them one from EMC and

00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,650
one from VMware the CEO of VMware spa

00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:22,990
at one of the executives at EMC to take

00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:25,390
the job at Capgemini to then manage the

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,740
relationship back to MC now what they

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,320
were doing is they were putting their

00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,820
most trusted person in their partner so

00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,440
that we could build the relationship to

00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,780
the next level so it really is a good

00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,670
example but now that I'm a kept gem and

00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:39,040
I'm saying what can I do corporate

00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,900
headquarters in is in Paris well the

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,880
corporate Council is the head of

00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:45,190
diversity at Capgemini she calls it

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,200
women at cap and of course she calls me

00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,960
right away oh I hear you're you're on

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,480
our team what can we do together so the

00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,460
reputation goes with you and stays and

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,750
one of the things that I suggested and I

00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,360
think this is important for all people

00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:00,520
it's not just inside your company that

00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,190
you're building women's reputations it's

00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,650
who they are outside the company and how

00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,020
they can drive business for the company

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:11,080
so what we have done is we've built two

00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:13,180
things one is all of the women outside

00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,070
the company they're our customers we are

00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,020
going to match them with a woman in the

00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,000
company at the VP level or above it

00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,980
doesn't have to be the most senior so

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,960
that they are very visible in driving

00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,790
business forward so that gets that

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,250
relationship and it's a different point

00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:29,290
of view about business and then the

00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,480
second is and this is something we can

00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,460
all do look at events and what events

00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,640
and programs where we can we target

00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,710
women to receive awards in business from

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,330
a business point of view so I know we're

00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,890
talking a lot about diversity but let's

00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:44,560
talk about this from a business

00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,990
perspective and show how influential and

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:53,700
how commanding of the business we can

00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:55,540
date so with that which was an amazing

00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,790
on its own I think that's a whole

00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,130
different conversation just on that I

00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,240
would like to open it up to the room so

00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,010
that we can really make this an

00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,890
inclusive conversation for everyone

00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,390
because our vision is really continuing

00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,880
this conversation after summit

00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,530
throughout the year so we have some mics

00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,190
around the room if there's any questions

00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:18,130
from from you oh thank you

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,840
so I guess I just have a confession to

00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,970
make and I want to I just want to see if

00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,590
this is okay because I feel a little

00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,760
weird about it I'm a hiring manager in

00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,760
my company I've got

00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:38,050
I'm hiring too what I mean not for this

00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:50,890
it's for us for building engineers like

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:57,369
every over is there anything wrong with

00:39:50,890 --> 00:40:01,020
that like will I get I mean you're

00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:03,670
you're opening yourself up for a lawsuit

00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:07,599
right you you are talking about

00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:09,400
discriminatory hiring right yeah but I'm

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,290
talking about doing it and in divine oh

00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,329
you might you're being taped you might

00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:14,589
yeah

00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:17,589
it's a Northwest company and it's not

00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:20,589
but it's I mean is there a date like is

00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:22,300
there a danger in I guess there is but

00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:25,150
there's so few women in the industry

00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:28,240
that I'm so are you are you going higher

00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:31,480
more qua you have two candidates her

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,930
equally qualified are you hiring no no

00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,609
you have a male who is more qualified by

00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:42,640
a little bit are you hiring the man or

00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:44,410
are you hiring the woman I think I would

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,720
hire the loan because there's so few of

00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,400
us and I prefer I just wanted to give

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,589
another perspective again I was at an

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,780
event last week where somebody came up

00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:54,790
to me and and what his response was did

00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,980
you interview a woman who was a woman

00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:58,960
considered when the company is hiring

00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,609
somebody so I mean there's a different

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,589
perspective that you can bring so that

00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:04,270
you don't create any issues for your

00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:05,500
organization and these are thing that

00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:08,079
we're hearing a lot of when we're out

00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,630
there interviewing is that women want to

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,700
be hired because of merit so women don't

00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,810
want to be hired just to like check the

00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,280
quota box and put up on a shelf

00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:17,140
somewhere they want to know that they

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,060
got the job because they deserve it so

00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,250
absolutely and that's how I got my job I

00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,170
really just feel like women in this

00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,339
particular position are better but I

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,800
hear what you're saying I've got to be

00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:29,380
careful about it yeah and the reality is

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,510
that we all have biases every single one

00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,609
of us have biases and there are

00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:36,700
techniques that you can use as an

00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:38,470
organization to deal with those biases

00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,630
so measuring things

00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:42,880
is extraordinarily important it's

00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,680
writing things down I think even

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,040
something as simple as a code of conduct

00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,599
is it's not that the code of conducts

00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,040
ever say anything that we're surprised

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,450
about it's just that somebody is

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,810
actually making that part of the

00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:58,420
conversation but biases are they exist

00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:00,369
for all of us and so measuring things

00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:04,300
other techniques that are going to help

00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:07,030
us higher regardless of that bias we

00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,369
shouldn't hire because of a bias in I in

00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:11,470
in in any particular group yeah but we

00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:14,890
can use tools and there's even tools I

00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:17,140
recently read an article that it was

00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:19,930
something like the top 10 tools that are

00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,550
addressing diversity in tech or

00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:23,320
something like that and there's a whole

00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:25,540
host of startups out there that are

00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,700
building cool tools that are allowing

00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:31,930
you to for example source resumes

00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:35,230
without looking at any any gender gender

00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:37,510
any to get identify is's based on merit

00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:39,670
alone there are other startups that are

00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:41,619
doing a whole host of different things

00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,330
and I would encourage us of course I'm a

00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:45,550
tools person I work for cloud foundry

00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:47,230
I'm in the engineering group so I'm a

00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,820
tools person and I like to throw tools

00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,950
at everything but there are some tools

00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,180
that we can use to eliminate the bias

00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,410
yes that's a good idea she take the

00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,210
names off the resume so I don't

00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:58,390
immediately exactly do what I do or I

00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:00,070
put put them in different exact one

00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:02,170
thing I want to correct is that you know

00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:04,270
there's also a situation of you have an

00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:06,099
all-male team or an all-female team and

00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:07,570
you actively want to increase the

00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:10,300
diversity I think that that's quite

00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:13,180
valid right because you're trying to

00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:15,040
that's one of the qualifications of what

00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:18,490
you're trying to do in the team to get

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:22,960
to more innovation etc no matter what

00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:24,400
you know just to expand it hi and this

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,720
is I think it's actually one of the

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,609
struggles that we all have right now

00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,260
right because I don't one of the

00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:31,750
struggles that I have in my career is

00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:34,270
what I see a lot of time happens is that

00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,190
we instead of creating inconclusive

00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,109
culture we're creating another elite

00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:40,390
club like you know there is a lead woman

00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:42,099
who are extremely smart and technical

00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:45,280
and you try to propagate this and

00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:47,020
suddenly we kick out this relationship

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,390
will create even bigger gap because when

00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,870
I come to work guys looking at me did I

00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:53,030
get my job because I'm a

00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:55,820
because you want to increase that or did

00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,920
I get the job because because I'm

00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,840
qualified and it sometimes won't start

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,970
work extra hard and extra time and

00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,660
sacrifice more time and it's just not

00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,610
fair

00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,070
so if the question is about you know I

00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:09,980
was fortunate enough to have a great

00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:11,660
mentors that a man and they understand

00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,940
they don't for me I learn from them so

00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:17,510
how do we create this culture where it's

00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,970
not an exclusive club but actually men

00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:22,520
also change and be part of that and

00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:24,950
whatever else diversity is there we need

00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:28,280
to create immense sponsors too and it's

00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:30,110
not as a daddy figure but more as a

00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,500
partner figure right who can help and

00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:35,930
who can sponsor and who can bring people

00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:40,250
women into the powerful positions so how

00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:42,230
do you do that it's absolutely important

00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:45,140
to have the diversity and the diversity

00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:46,940
is not just narrowly focus on on women

00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,650
but instead it's broadening that out

00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,120
because I think you can learn from

00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,900
having all different kinds of diversity

00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,210
because then you get different

00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,350
perspectives on issues and you look at

00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:56,900
things differently which i think is

00:44:54,350 --> 00:45:02,030
incredibly important so I agree with you

00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:04,010
there I I think part of how you expand

00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,570
that diversity with men is goes back to

00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:07,760
what you said which is you don't deliver

00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:10,460
business results the more that you show

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,560
that having a diverse team to the men

00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:15,140
around you the more and you want to

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,240
highlight it it's it's it's highlighting

00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:19,190
look what we were able to accomplish and

00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,250
part of this was having a diverse team

00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:23,990
and I would say explicitly at times and

00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:26,210
also by the way I've had terrific male

00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:31,460
mentor sponsors you know there's a lot

00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:33,170
of great men out there my name is Lucy

00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:36,500
mangas I'm the director of system

00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:37,940
integrators and alliances at EMC and I

00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,340
just want to make a couple of comments

00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,770
I'm originally from Mexico City and I

00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,830
got moved to the Bay Area when I was 28

00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:48,020
I'm not gonna say how many years ago but

00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:50,060
some few years ago and I was very

00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,370
focused in the telecom industry and in

00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,830
sales in Mexico so as you can imagine I

00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:58,190
was probably the only woman around a lot

00:45:54,830 --> 00:46:00,620
of sharks around for many years and when

00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:03,650
I moved here I found out that I have to

00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:04,579
work harder and I have to work really my

00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,699
voice here

00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:11,359
because I had an accent I was latina I

00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:13,549
was 28 and everybody and I'm short five

00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,439
- so you know everybody's like looking

00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:16,999
at me and saying you know which is does

00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:20,900
she have to offer right so you have to

00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:23,239
work really hard and also from my career

00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:26,209
I have to make very tough choices

00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:29,479
because the moment I have to decide to

00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:32,229
have kids it was a matter of priorities

00:46:29,479 --> 00:46:35,299
and because you have to work harder I

00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:37,579
found that in the Bay Area it was not

00:46:35,299 --> 00:46:41,449
okay to say I have to go and pick up my

00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:45,109
kids I was one time in a very high-level

00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:47,839
meeting when just the HP and Compaq

00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:50,769
merger had happened and I had an eight

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:53,539
moon or eight month old baby at home and

00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:55,789
the VP of Marketing turn on me and say

00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:57,739
okay let's sit down and let's plan and

00:46:55,789 --> 00:46:59,749
like oh we have to go with your baby

00:46:57,739 --> 00:47:01,459
right by giving me this look and this

00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:04,519
was a woman by giving you look like

00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:07,099
you're not gonna work for me so it was

00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:09,499
tough you know it is it is tough so I

00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:12,289
always say that you know if you want to

00:47:09,499 --> 00:47:15,189
attract the right talent it is a matter

00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:18,259
of given the flexibility they need and

00:47:15,189 --> 00:47:20,900
it doesn't matter to gender it to me you

00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:23,209
know for me having had teens that are

00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,969
all men and then teams that are all

00:47:23,209 --> 00:47:29,359
women for me the best works the mixed

00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:32,089
right because to your point you combine

00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,799
IQs you combine talents and that's when

00:47:32,089 --> 00:47:37,640
you bring the team but you have to know

00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:39,349
what your team needs and give them that

00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:43,369
and in flexibility then you will attract

00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:45,679
a lot of women so thank you that was

00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:47,569
great hi there

00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,869
first of all I just want to say that

00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:53,059
this is really awesome

00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:55,849
it is really awesome really is I'm so

00:47:53,059 --> 00:47:57,729
happy to like finally be really having

00:47:55,849 --> 00:48:00,140
this conversation so it's really great

00:47:57,729 --> 00:48:03,019
so thanks to everybody for putting it

00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:06,859
together my question is really about

00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:10,999
education so I saw in the trailer and

00:48:06,859 --> 00:48:15,109
have seen a lot of push towards

00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:17,380
education of the next generation of you

00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:19,660
know up-and-coming women

00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:22,420
Nalla gist s-- but what I wonder is is

00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:24,430
that there seems to be a pretty big

00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,290
workforce out there and lots of people

00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:28,480
who want to change jobs and lots of

00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:31,210
people who want to learn new things but

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:34,420
what I don't see is a big push to Train

00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:36,580
really smart capable women some of whom

00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:39,160
like myself might be in this room who

00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,840
are like somewhat technically capable

00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,030
but I'm not an engineer I'm actually a

00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:48,570
designer and I'm learning to become a

00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:51,490
developer as well so how do we push that

00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:54,630
our own generation like how do we

00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:57,550
support ourselves to become better

00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:59,110
technologists so I I don't have a

00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:02,110
general answer but I'm gonna give you a

00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:03,760
specific opportunity answer right so I

00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:05,770
work with a company called galvanize

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,690
which is a startup ecosystem and

00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:10,090
community and they run a program called

00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:12,310
G school which is a six month immersive

00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:13,780
full staff development you can come from

00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:15,310
marketing you can come from design

00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:18,010
whatever you want to become a junior

00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:20,140
programmer the last group that they just

00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:23,530
graduated in San Francisco 50% women

00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:26,680
lots of diversity of color they make it

00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:28,630
is part of their agenda you know so I

00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,130
think that it's great it's inspirational

00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,690
in terms of organizations I wish I could

00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,760
say I'd see it all over the place but

00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:35,380
I'll give you at least that instance and

00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,510
maybe a call out to them because they

00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:40,210
are doing that and by the way it is a

00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:41,980
male led company yeah who cares sorry it

00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:44,590
doesn't matter they of doing like it is

00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,150
part of their agenda to promote that

00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:49,030
kind of diversity and to give those

00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,800
opportunities I just have a comment at

00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,080
Intel we have something called a dot

00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,780
program it lasts from three to six

00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,970
months you can choose whichever one this

00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:00,280
is kind of the time place where you go

00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:03,010
for cross-training join another group

00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,020
work with them briefly do I like it and

00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:09,430
I good at it and then you can just move

00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:11,020
over so we make that possible so there

00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,880
there are a number of these

00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,410
organizations it's it's really fabulous

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,730
one of the things that we're doing sort

00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,320
of as a call to action from the

00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,260
documentaries we started a website

00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:23,440
that's in development called cheese

00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:27,220
coding org and it's not just for women

00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,220
but that's what we named it and it's

00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,079
actually a resource that's going to

00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:34,050
we have all sorts of and still it does

00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:36,060
now already has all sorts of information

00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:38,010
there on where you can go to learn so

00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,319
whether it's hacker school hack Brite

00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:42,569
Academy G school I mean there are so

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,190
many organizations out there now even

00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:45,480
Khan Academy you know online if you want

00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,480
to do it but if you want to be in a room

00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,310
with other people so have a look at that

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,790
web source and then anybody in this room

00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:55,440
that wants to add to the webpage or help

00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,569
we're gonna have a mentor match but but

00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,760
that's such a great question and there

00:50:57,569 --> 00:51:00,990
are a lot luckily of great organizations

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,530
that are helping to train people that

00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:06,480
are mid-career in coding one other yeah

00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:08,310
one other comment I wanted to make in

00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,109
terms of because you know we're talking

00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:12,300
its Cloud Foundry and open source event

00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:14,130
what have you is one of them I represent

00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,810
HP on the OpenStack Foundation board of

00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:18,300
directors and we had a discussion about

00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:20,490
gender diversity recently at the board

00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,410
level and one of the things that that we

00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,910
do within that community within that

00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,390
open-source community is we have a lot

00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,300
of meetups

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:28,140
so those are great opportunities for

00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,000
coders to get together and they're

00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:32,730
usually there I mean if you go on to the

00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,829
OpenStack comm website there's tons of

00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:37,230
stuff out there in terms of various

00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:40,920
meetups you can go and meet other coders

00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:41,760
Lisa Marie here who is a at least marine

00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,339
down features waived

00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,740
she's runs this for us at HP and she's

00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:49,500
really engaged tightly engaged with the

00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,420
community and she herself has recently

00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,920
written a book on OpenStack so she's

00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,660
really trying to promote some of the

00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,829
gender diversity it's very personal to

00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,569
her and she's also just really

00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:59,250
passionate about this issue but that's a

00:51:57,569 --> 00:52:00,839
great way to meet other folks and learn

00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:03,000
more about a technology and get more

00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:04,859
engaged and I just had a comment about

00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,930
this so you brought up this notion that

00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:08,520
people here are trying to figure out how

00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:11,160
to get into technology well I was in

00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,720
Israel recently in a conversation with

00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,670
some very senior people and they were

00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,740
saying we have a shortage of people that

00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:18,180
are going into technology they're going

00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,609
into different industries that are more

00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,890
interesting like healthcare and so that

00:52:20,609 --> 00:52:25,710
came across what do we do with people

00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:27,300
that have degrees in other areas to

00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,920
bring them back into the workforce so

00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,020
that they can also be technologists so

00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,760
that they could build what is needed for

00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,680
their community so they can stay as

00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,210
impactful as a startup nation

00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,580
I think that's happening here

00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:40,470
Bay Area and across the US also so this

00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,320
is something we should take on as a

00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:45,180
group how do we get more people into

00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,790
technology and drive the number of women

00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:49,200
that are involved I also think and we're

00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:55,320
talking about this at lunch a little bit

00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:57,359
that that lunch I missed I can't in you

00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,040
know so I'll say something controversial

00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,349
you don't have to be good at math to be

00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,150
good at computer science I mean you

00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:06,089
don't have to be good at math to be an

00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:08,430
effective coder that's a better way so

00:53:06,089 --> 00:53:11,760
and certainly you don't have to remember

00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:13,410
your math from college to be effective

00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,540
in something like G school I was telling

00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,940
some of the folks at lunch I have a 21

00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:20,190
year old working in the bluemix garage

00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:22,260
who graduated from G school her

00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:24,750
undergraduate is in creative writing she

00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,849
did six months then of this full staff

00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:29,010
trained you know full staff programming

00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:32,099
she's doing awesome she's terrific her

00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:34,440
name is Savannah worth you know and and

00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:36,570
she brings all these soft skills along

00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,859
with it right and she told me she was

00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:40,890
being interviewed actually interviewed

00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:43,050
by a newspaper and she said you know

00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:44,760
that she got into it because she thought

00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:46,410
it was all about math and then she saw

00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,050
her brother who's a computer scientist

00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:50,339
and he was building these cool websites

00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,320
you know he was building real

00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:54,150
applications and she's like oh my god

00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:57,300
there's all this cool creativity I can

00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:59,940
build stuff and it completely changed it

00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:02,400
for her so I think that against part of

00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:04,710
these you know messages out to our own

00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,859
peers like to you know people midlife

00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,880
etc so I love that story and the one

00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:11,760
thing that I want to add to this

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,830
discussion is that and I'm putting

00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,599
myself on this list as well I'm not

00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:18,470
going to hold myself responsible to this

00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:21,690
for those of us who can support our

00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:23,160
fellow women who are coming into the

00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,500
field that are have been fortunate

00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,450
enough to be in the field we need to go

00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,550
the extra mile we need to support we

00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:32,070
need to go and do those meetups and we

00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:34,380
need to participate in those educational

00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:36,630
programs and so for all of you who can

00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:39,150
help somebody bring it to come into the

00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:41,609
field help teach them I'm putting myself

00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:43,320
on on unnoticed for that as well and I

00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:44,239
would love to encourage everyone else to

00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:49,399
do that as well

00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:51,529
you try ask a question yes oh absolutely

00:54:49,399 --> 00:54:53,029
yeah it was addressing the question here

00:54:51,529 --> 00:54:55,249
which is that you know the current

00:54:53,029 --> 00:54:58,789
workforce but absolutely we need to go

00:54:55,249 --> 00:54:59,899
into the schools yes absolutely

00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:01,909
especially because one of the biggest

00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:04,069
problems with education is the fact that

00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:07,099
they can't find teachers these schools

00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:09,469
might be to quote Jane Margolis

00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:11,689
you know technology rich but curriculum

00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:13,699
poor they can't find anybody to teach it

00:55:11,689 --> 00:55:15,589
the current teachers that are on tenure

00:55:13,699 --> 00:55:18,439
are intimidated they know that the kids

00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:19,639
know more than they do about this and if

00:55:18,439 --> 00:55:20,779
there's somebody who's a really good

00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,579
coder well they're gonna make a lot more

00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:25,039
money coding in a startup than they are

00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:26,569
as a teacher so you know what you can do

00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:28,159
to help and to go into the community and

00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:30,679
do that and be a role model then is is

00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:35,269
enormous ly beneficial great something

00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:37,249
else to tackle here hi I'm Tom oh I met

00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:40,009
New Relic formerly a pivotal and I'm

00:55:37,249 --> 00:55:41,989
hiring just like everybody else but I'm

00:55:40,009 --> 00:55:44,749
not just I'm not just putting that out

00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:46,459
there so hiring building teams you know

00:55:44,749 --> 00:55:47,809
all managers want to build their perfect

00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:49,549
team and they want everybody to get

00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:51,289
along and feel very productive and that

00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:55,219
they love work and look they'll stay and

00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:57,439
so on that topic you know if you already

00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:59,509
have a team that is predominantly a

00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:01,669
particular culture and maybe it might be

00:55:59,509 --> 00:56:04,309
predominantly a culture that is maybe

00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:06,499
white and male or Western and male and

00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:08,479
all that so I just kind of wanted to

00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:11,269
throw the question out there you've had

00:56:08,479 --> 00:56:12,979
experiences where you you want to bring

00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:15,349
in diversity because you think it'll

00:56:12,979 --> 00:56:16,699
make the team better and and I mean

00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:20,089
diversity in all the different ways we

00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:22,039
talked about not just for gender but you

00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:25,069
know how have you thought about that

00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:27,109
like I personally you know I've been

00:56:25,069 --> 00:56:28,369
involved with women who code and I run

00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:30,319
the women's job of a user group in San

00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:32,059
Francisco so I I do things are active

00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:34,909
for women in tech but for me personally

00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:36,439
I try to turn that switch off from my

00:56:34,909 --> 00:56:39,229
own personal career and just try to

00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:41,929
think well sometimes some people get

00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:44,239
into certain sectors first maybe white

00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:46,729
male just got into this sector first and

00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,929
you know they've been building teams and

00:56:46,729 --> 00:56:49,849
they're gonna hire people they feel

00:56:47,929 --> 00:56:52,219
comfortable with and you know we're

00:56:49,849 --> 00:56:54,190
trying to break that mold so when you're

00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:55,750
thinking about these teams and when

00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:57,100
seeing teams develop or when you built

00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:59,860
your own teams how have you thought

00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:01,840
about you know maintaining the

00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:03,790
productivity and the happiness that of

00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:06,010
the group that you have we're trying to

00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:10,780
change it if you had a non-diverse team

00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:13,210
to begin with Thanks you just you just

00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:15,940
basically said that the non-diverse team

00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:22,290
is more productive and happy than they

00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:25,600
will be with more diversity they feel

00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:26,920
right they're gonna they're gonna

00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,540
influence I'm not saying that they were

00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,370
more productive I'm saying they're gonna

00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,600
have an influence while I like this

00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:33,640
candidate you know I don't like that

00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,650
candidate and you kind of have to weigh

00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,680
why do you like this Canada more well

00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:41,260
yes yeah you're saying I like this idea

00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:43,570
about blinding the gender to start with

00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:45,730
and you know just just from the get-go

00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:48,100
not just gender but anything and

00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:50,620
actually where they went to school right

00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:52,270
where they went to school that's a good

00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:54,160
where you have to school and really just

00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:57,100
look at it less they're very close out

00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,660
of school to the point you guys are

00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:01,210
raising to have an open dialogue with

00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:02,440
your yes okay you interview say look I

00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,820
want to put this all on the table we're

00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,320
gonna be looking at this right I want to

00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,420
make sure we're not going to be biased

00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,470
in certain ways recognizing everyone has

00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,330
its natural ones but if you kind of

00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:12,610
bring it to the forefront then I think

00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:15,700
folks are more likely to pay attention

00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:17,350
to it so I will also say you have to

00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,750
look for subtleties that are happening

00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:21,370
once you have the diversity because I

00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:23,350
have diversity right and I have a lot of

00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:26,590
I actually have more women than I do men

00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:28,660
as it happens right now but huh we were

00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:30,790
tidying up for a visit right we're

00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:33,130
tightening up and I tell Steven Savannah

00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:35,530
I'm like guys go clean up you know and I

00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:37,360
come back and Steve is off having a good

00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:39,880
discussion and Savannah's cleaning up

00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:43,480
and I'm looking at this I say and I'm

00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,940
like Steve come here and clean up and

00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,680
then I'd say to Suzanne Savannah

00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:49,360
privately I said look it's not that

00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,760
Steve is deliberately saying she's a

00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,470
girl so she gets to clean up but you're

00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,050
jumping it you're doing it you're

00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:58,450
letting him do this so of course he's

00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:00,370
going to let you clean up don't want to

00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,290
do it just tell them to come help you

00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,500
well it's true I was just in a very

00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:06,270
large CEO CXO meeting and

00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,490
somebody said to me so where's the water

00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:14,190
I said oh I don't know we'll just have

00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:17,310
to find some won't we it was like we're

00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:18,660
in Vegas I also think it's important

00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:20,670
though to think about it's not just

00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,260
diversity for the sake of diversity it's

00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:24,270
not just a gender issue for the sake of

00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:26,490
it being a gender issue it's the idea

00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:27,900
that when you have diversity on your

00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:29,370
team you're going to create better

00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,020
product and you're going to create

00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:34,080
product that is going to serve a greater

00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:35,370
breadth of humanity and and that's the

00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,800
important you also can have more

00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:39,840
efficiency and so I think that that's

00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,730
really the end goal when you talk to

00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:44,330
people we have someone from from Etsy

00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:47,340
who talks about how her male co-workers

00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:49,380
actually really liked having more women

00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:51,720
on the team suddenly they step it up

00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:53,790
suddenly the conversations a little bit

00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,200
more you know elevated everybody's on

00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,700
their game bringing their a-game to the

00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,110
table so but I think it's really

00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,640
thinking about you know what are the

00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,770
possibilities your team might be doing

00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,750
really well right now as it is and it's

01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:05,850
efficient but what are the possibilities

01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:08,850
of that team if if you suddenly had

01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:12,480
diverse perspectives and thought in

01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:14,130
addition that's a question so we had a

01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,010
comment earlier from that lovely lady

01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:18,780
talking about the clubs you know how you

01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,100
can end up having girls that tend to

01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,930
stick together and it becomes very

01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:25,140
cliquey I actually want to bring up

01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:26,460
something that I've not heard sorry I

01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,410
forgot your name the lady who runs a

01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,720
platform engineering at Cornell hi

01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:34,410
Cornelia so you had brought up the fact

01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:36,540
that there's a lot of cultural hidden

01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:38,310
cultural things as well different races

01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:41,160
and religions and this than any other I

01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:42,990
think bullying is a big thing that

01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:46,380
people are ignoring and they're hiding

01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:49,500
behind the gender Wars and and I've been

01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,710
bullied more by women in tech than by

01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,710
men

01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,609
IIIi have had so many different people

01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,869
come up and tell me oh you know you're

01:00:56,609 --> 01:00:58,710
doing more public speaking on you should

01:00:57,869 --> 01:01:00,180
wear a dress

01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:01,859
you should wear makeup or you should you

01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:03,570
know something or another and the guys

01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:05,040
actually don't care what I wear they're

01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:07,500
gonna let chat me no matter what anyway

01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,930
you know so so I mean let's face it but

01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:13,349
but but but the thing is like what are

01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:15,000
we doing to foster some of you know not

01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:16,650
judging each other I mean moms judge

01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,090
each other all the time I'm a mother you

01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:19,980
know we all know how mums get with each

01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:21,810
other oh you work I don't work I stay at

01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:24,750
home how do we stop the bullying amongst

01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:26,580
ourselves to also then foster the sort

01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:29,970
of culture we want other women to bring

01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:31,950
in yeah in in so I'm gonna come back to

01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:34,170
the comment that I kind of glossed over

01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:36,540
earlier which is that I think that I

01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:38,369
think code of conducts are really

01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:39,720
interesting I'm gonna slow down a little

01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:42,750
bit here and say what I tried to say

01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:44,640
earlier in that I'm gonna read a code of

01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:47,400
conduct and I read it and I think come

01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,590
on nobody's gonna do this and and of

01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,810
course I realized that people do do do

01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:53,730
that it's very real and I'm a mom and

01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:56,910
I'm a working mom so I've been on the

01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:59,010
and other end of that as well I think so

01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:02,220
I think code of conducts putting it out

01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:04,109
there so that people read it and and

01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:06,960
that it's by the way that it's out there

01:02:04,109 --> 01:02:08,580
at the beginning of a conference and and

01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,710
the Cloud Foundry foundation did a great

01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:12,930
job the code of conduct was there way

01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:15,300
before the program was there even before

01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:18,750
the call for call for papers so I think

01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:20,730
that making it saying hey we are making

01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,589
a stand gets people to read it gets

01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:24,720
people that it's right there on the menu

01:02:22,589 --> 01:02:27,119
it's on the front front menu I think I

01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,430
think that that's part of it and then I

01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:32,940
think that another part of it is that

01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:34,800
leading by example I I don't know what

01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:36,900
the the the I don't know how to have

01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,609
other people do things that they

01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,760
shouldn't be doing but I know that if

01:02:38,609 --> 01:02:44,040
I'm less judgmental if I use if I think

01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,560
twice before I say something and again

01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:48,450
we all have biases and if I stop for a

01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,000
moment and I think about my own biases

01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:53,700
before I respond and think that through

01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,369
and and honestly being less judgmental

01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:58,080
personally I think that that's one of

01:02:56,369 --> 01:03:01,339
the ways that we can do it I'm not going

01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:03,730
to judge the stay-at-home moms because

01:03:01,339 --> 01:03:05,590
that there's no judgment there ever

01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:07,570
he's making choices and so taking

01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:11,440
personal responsibility is certainly

01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:12,670
part of it you know it gets back to what

01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,320
you just said when you create

01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:16,869
communities of people that are

01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:19,359
collaborative open and welcoming and you

01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:21,670
keep out the bullies from those

01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:23,530
communities you start to see a change in

01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:25,690
the way people are working together I

01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:26,950
know that I've been in five built emcs

01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:29,830
Women's Leadership Forum on the west

01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:31,690
coast and my style and my openness and

01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:33,580
and what I was bringing to the table

01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:35,260
I brought in people like me at different

01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:37,810
levels in the organization and gave them

01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:40,570
equal power that I had so by doing that

01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:42,130
the community leveled out and everyone

01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:43,510
realized that they could be part of this

01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:45,460
and they could be a leader and they

01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:47,830
belonged and then we spread it out to

01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:50,590
the external community so you can change

01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:53,080
it by creating a culture that is very

01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:55,390
powerful and welcoming and that's

01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,130
another way that you can get this to

01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:59,619
move in a different direction it's up to

01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,720
us all right that's great we have

01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:03,670
another question hi I'm Shane Goldberg

01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,470
I'm from HP and I moved to the Bay Area

01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:08,080
just a year ago and I'm really honored

01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:10,600
to be in such a session thank you

01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,980
and you mentioned before about in

01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,260
talking with the team before

01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:17,250
interviewing and what I found really

01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:20,350
difficult is that it's true that we

01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:22,570
measure business results but also how we

01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:24,250
get there is different right so yes I

01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:25,930
smile more than most of my colleagues

01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:27,880
and now we might I would probably get

01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:31,630
the same business results and maybe even

01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:34,540
better but we don't appreciate different

01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:36,250
styles right we expect everybody to

01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:39,040
behave like men so I know I have some

01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:40,510
men qualities but we saw before in the

01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,940
movie we will be missing 1 million

01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:45,070
engineer positions so not all women has

01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:46,869
to have those men qualities they can be

01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:48,550
friendly and they can as I said they

01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:50,320
don't have to be the best at math how

01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:52,780
can we build such a culture that really

01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,580
appreciate different styles different

01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:57,460
qualities especially with women which

01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:58,930
are yes I am a better manager once I

01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,690
understood that I need to continue be

01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:06,240
and act as a woman instead of trying to

01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:06,240
be a man and manager good point

01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:10,900
but I think that's a really interesting

01:05:08,949 --> 01:05:12,339
point and something that we've learned

01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,930
from a lot of the psychologists that

01:05:12,339 --> 01:05:16,119
we've talked to it's about instilling

01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:18,430
confidence and there are young girls and

01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:20,499
that's such an important thing and still

01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:22,359
so much confidence in our girls I mean

01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:24,039
and boys too of course but especially in

01:05:22,359 --> 01:05:25,269
our girls that they really can be what

01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:27,489
they want whatever they want to be that

01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:30,069
they are enough as they are and then

01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:32,170
hopefully you know it takes it takes a

01:05:30,069 --> 01:05:33,609
long time to change a stereotype but if

01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:34,989
we're able to do that and bring up our

01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:36,579
girls with all sorts of confidence I

01:05:34,989 --> 01:05:38,650
think that will help yes you can be good

01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:40,569
at math and you can be good at English

01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:42,549
you can be good at art and you can be

01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:44,559
good at science yeah and the other thing

01:05:42,549 --> 01:05:46,630
that I want to add is it's not just

01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:49,569
instilling the confidence and girls and

01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:52,329
the confidence and boys but it's also as

01:05:49,569 --> 01:05:55,809
mothers of the next generation of kids I

01:05:52,329 --> 01:05:57,430
only have a son and my son has a already

01:05:55,809 --> 01:06:00,160
long term girlfriend who is a very

01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:02,949
powerful and confident young woman and

01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:06,039
he's had a friends of his say gosh how

01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:07,390
can you be with her and he's like what

01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:11,049
do you mean she's awesome

01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:13,329
and so we can as women we set an example

01:06:11,049 --> 01:06:16,329
not just for other young ladies but we

01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:19,650
set examples for young men and that's

01:06:16,329 --> 01:06:19,650
hugely important

01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:28,029
tap-tap my question or rather I'd like

01:06:26,709 --> 01:06:31,269
to discuss a little bit more about

01:06:28,029 --> 01:06:32,920
socioeconomic factors and going back to

01:06:31,269 --> 01:06:37,449
the confidence level because I think

01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:40,359
that you can shine a spotlight on a girl

01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:42,549
all you want but if she has no clue what

01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:45,190
she can be if she was raised in a place

01:06:42,549 --> 01:06:47,890
that didn't have a computer or parents

01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:51,130
who don't frankly want her to succeed it

01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:52,660
just gets so hardcore on how to change

01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:58,289
that so my question is how would you

01:06:52,660 --> 01:07:00,309
approach changing that or fixing that

01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:01,449
well there are a lot of great

01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:04,630
organizations one of them is called

01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:06,489
black girls code and I think that's

01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:08,049
starting it these are girls that it's

01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:11,650
primarily in Oakland but now it's

01:07:08,049 --> 01:07:14,680
national as well and they are bringing

01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:18,060
young girls that are from societies that

01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:19,680
typically would be marginalized to tech

01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,730
to a space where they're feeling

01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,380
comfortable they're learning what it's

01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:24,420
like to hack and yeah I mean they're in

01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:25,770
a sheltered environment to start with

01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:27,210
but they're getting their confidence up

01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:29,490
so that they can go then

01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:31,110
be it you know and at a hack somewhere

01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:32,700
with with men and women and people of

01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:34,440
all different colors or they can be the

01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,360
only woman of color or girl of color in

01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,530
that room and feel more confident so

01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,730
there are other organizations like that

01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:40,500
out there but that's one in particular

01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:42,680
that I can speak to it I think it's

01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,680
doing

01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,490
well yeah absolutely

01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:49,860
absolutely I mean that's right it's just

01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:51,120
one in Robin does just one example Robin

01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:53,580
I'm counting on you at the State

01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:56,580
Department to get them to add it to

01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:57,600
mandatory curriculum and uh yeah in

01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:00,480
elementary schools

01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:03,810
I just like to point out that right here

01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,180
in the Bay Area we have YWCA's that

01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:08,160
support tech girls so then go to

01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:10,320
underprivileged schools have a free

01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:12,780
service come on in here's a makeup kit

01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,700
use it see what you can do with it

01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:16,830
they take them to the Maker Faire so

01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:18,990
there are grassroots efforts right here

01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:21,150
in town and please join them and they

01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:23,910
can always use speakers on the weekends

01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:25,470
or during the school day and that's one

01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:28,140
thing and another thing in tilt it is

01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:29,760
they have like these corpse-like five

01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:31,980
five people going somewhere maybe to

01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,900
Ethiopia maybe to India and one of the

01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:36,690
things we did is we had like a tablet

01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:39,120
and a phone and help them like determine

01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:41,670
how much fertilizer farmer needs what

01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:43,950
crop when and stuff like that and this

01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:45,300
was an easy way for them to see how they

01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:47,100
could bring technology to their

01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:49,830
community increase their own social

01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:51,210
status something that even a woman can

01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:54,359
do it she doesn't have to be like 200

01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:56,250
pounds muscle building anything and then

01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:57,990
that comes back to them saying okay she

01:08:56,250 --> 01:09:00,089
can earn a living she can be important

01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:02,190
in the society educating her is

01:09:00,089 --> 01:09:05,100
important and then the economic cycle

01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:08,400
feeds in and that helps the women so we

01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:10,410
have a comment as well I think as a

01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,089
community we should do too is I've

01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:14,760
encouraged my daughter to help in this

01:09:12,089 --> 01:09:16,350
area as well she's only 13 but she is

01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:18,660
one of the she was one of those kids who

01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:20,460
loved math she was initially someone

01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,930
intimidated about you know raising her

01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,030
hand to be known as the smart kid but

01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:25,290
she loves math she has a great math

01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:26,700
teacher this year it's the first time

01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,970
she said a woman math teacher so she's

01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,380
thrilled and

01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:31,300
think she wanted to do she wanted to go

01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:32,890
out and help other kids so she's now

01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,670
been volunteering after school three

01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,830
days a week

01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:37,720
tutoring low-income kids and math and

01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:39,010
that's something where she's very

01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,840
passionate about it and I feel like

01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:42,640
she's you know instilling in the next

01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:45,640
generation to trying to help them and

01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:47,380
when I first contacted the folks who run

01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,910
this program that she's part of they

01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,800
were just thrilled to have a girl who

01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:51,700
loves math because they were saying they

01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,620
need more of that

01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:55,780
so she's recently enlisted four of her

01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:57,150
friends to go along with her so for four

01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:59,260
girlfriends so it's kind of like

01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:03,730
encouraging that piece as well I think

01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:06,160
is important these are these are great

01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:09,340
great efforts and everything but I mean

01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:11,920
we have a systemic education issue in

01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:14,890
the United States between the affluent

01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,840
and they not affluent I mean here here

01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:19,120
in Silicon Valley the difference between

01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:21,940
a school in northern Sunnyvale

01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:24,370
or in San Jose versus the facilities in

01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:28,650
Cupertino or Palo Alto it's horrific

01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:31,420
right you know I mean it's it's it's I

01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:32,800
wish I knew how to fix that I think you

01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:36,010
know we have to keep raising our voices

01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,680
more you know politically right and and

01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:40,960
going to you know going to Washington

01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:43,090
and shining a light on it and you know

01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,430
because it's not just about code right I

01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:47,560
mean it's even it's it's systemic and

01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:48,940
it's fundamental yeah I will say that

01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:53,020
we've been into some private schools

01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:55,570
filming like in Tony areas that don't

01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:57,130
have any more access to computer science

01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:59,290
education in other words they don't

01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:02,590
they're not teaching it before junior

01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:04,210
year of high school for the AP class so

01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:05,650
that's kind of a problem across board it

01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:07,210
doesn't matter if you're at a private

01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:08,020
school or a public school in fact some

01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:11,350
of the public schools

01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:12,970
thanks to code org and code for a day

01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,830
dave code and some of those

01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:16,720
organizations are having more access to

01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:18,730
it than some of the private schools so

01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,870
we have time for two more questions I

01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:24,910
know there's been a couple of people

01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:26,310
waiting yes Robin you you started off by

01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:29,320
saying that we have a marketing problem

01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:31,780
around whoo what a coder looks like and

01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,010
who they are and the CTO of the country

01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:36,130
said

01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:39,090
in the jobs movie actually all seven of

01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:41,080
the men were cast that originally

01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:43,270
participated in creating the Mack or

01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:45,610
cast in the movie and the four women

01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:48,580
were not so I guess I wonder like how do

01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:50,020
we how do we like we're already having a

01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,400
marketing problem within tech but then

01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,630
Hollywood gates that even more and

01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,820
leaves out all the women that were

01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:56,349
actually involved in something so how

01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:57,790
how do we fix that yeah that's

01:11:56,349 --> 01:12:00,520
interesting we're actually presenting

01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:03,940
I'm doing a speech and then we're

01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,800
showing the film at Sony to women in

01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,909
technology Hollywood on Thursday and I'm

01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,320
trying to figure out if I have enough

01:12:06,909 --> 01:12:10,420
time to sort of change it a little bit

01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:14,230
this presentation so that we can really

01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:16,119
focus on that because I think that where

01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:18,219
did some astounding numbers and I don't

01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:21,250
have them up top of my head so I won't

01:12:18,219 --> 01:12:23,110
give them but the number of hours that

01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:25,480
you know young girls watch television

01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:27,699
and the longer they watch television the

01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:30,369
worse their own perception of their self

01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:33,340
becomes because women girls just women

01:12:30,369 --> 01:12:36,520
aren't in leadership roles and they're

01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:38,679
often you know sexualized in horrible

01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:41,080
ways and the media so I actually

01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:42,820
personally think that that Hollywood has

01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,710
a lot to do with this it's the same way

01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:45,790
there was too much smoking going on and

01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:47,409
everybody starts smoking when they're

01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:49,780
smoking and drinking and that stuff like

01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:51,400
that in films and television radio and

01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:52,929
even in our books but I think that

01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,520
Hollywood has a big role to play and can

01:12:52,929 --> 01:12:57,159
make a big change if they start putting

01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:00,820
women in strong positions and strong

01:12:57,159 --> 01:13:04,440
roles showing them in leadership roles

01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:04,440
in science and anything else

01:13:08,659 --> 01:13:12,210
hello right what Geena Davis is doing a

01:13:10,949 --> 01:13:13,650
lot also we just got back from the

01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:15,719
Bentonville Film Festival which is Gina

01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:16,949
Davis's inaugural Film Festival and it

01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:19,500
was all about championing women and

01:13:16,949 --> 01:13:21,329
diversity in film so II I mean it to

01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:24,059
start most a lot not all but a lot of

01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:25,590
the films were documentaries which

01:13:24,059 --> 01:13:28,349
unfortunately don't get seen as don't

01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:29,699
get as much exposure but she's talking a

01:13:28,349 --> 01:13:32,550
lot about it the Geena Davis Institute

01:13:29,699 --> 01:13:33,809
for gender equality is a really

01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:35,610
interesting thing to look up if you're

01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,989
interested in that they am they're doing

01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:38,909
what they can to really try to get more

01:13:36,989 --> 01:13:40,199
women in leadership roles so that we

01:13:38,909 --> 01:13:42,329
have better role models for our girls

01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:44,429
it's not just the tech issue no it's not

01:13:42,329 --> 01:13:46,170
a tech issue and that's not primarily I

01:13:44,429 --> 01:13:48,329
mean it's not only a tech issue yeah

01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:49,320
awesome in our last question yeah thank

01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:52,739
you for being so patient

01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:55,320
I just wanted to add a little bit to our

01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:57,030
discussion here you know we had the

01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:00,900
issue that you'd brought up about how

01:13:57,030 --> 01:14:04,260
women bosses are more bully people a

01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:06,480
little more sometimes than male bosses I

01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,969
just wanted to put this thought out to

01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:11,250
all of you lots of times what happens is

01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:14,639
people think hey I'm a mother I know how

01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:15,960
it is to be a mother so you know you we

01:14:14,639 --> 01:14:17,880
kind of feel like we can judge the other

01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,769
person because we know how it is to be a

01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,599
mother where is the main thing I don't

01:14:19,769 --> 01:14:24,840
know how it is so I'll give this person

01:14:21,599 --> 01:14:26,820
some more leeway or whatever right and

01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,920
but we have to understand that each of

01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:30,809
us our experiences of being a mother are

01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:32,369
very very different and we cannot sit in

01:14:30,809 --> 01:14:36,300
judgment on somebody else's situation

01:14:32,369 --> 01:14:37,949
and and so I think if we were to take

01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:42,119
that seriously we would be much more

01:14:37,949 --> 01:14:44,880
open to you know being flexible with our

01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:45,389
people I think I just want to leave that

01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,119
there

01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:50,219
I love that thank you very much thank

01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:53,099
you thank you for letting us wrap up on

01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:57,349
that that's a great way to conversation

01:14:53,099 --> 01:14:57,349
I just we have one thing for the mics

01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,309
one other quick thing I just wanted to

01:15:00,809 --> 01:15:05,159
share with you we were having the

01:15:02,309 --> 01:15:07,530
discussion about how you know kids in

01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:09,570
underprivileged areas are not exposed to

01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:12,179
math and computer science and things

01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:15,389
like that I mean I had a shocking

01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:17,429
example recently of a kid who goes to a

01:15:15,389 --> 01:15:19,530
Cupertino School I mean these schools

01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:20,780
are considered the best in math in the

01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:23,570
country right

01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:26,179
and she was hesitant to go take a Java

01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:27,820
course in I mean she's in junior high

01:15:26,179 --> 01:15:30,199
she's moving to high school

01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:32,389
and the thing is none of her friends

01:15:30,199 --> 01:15:34,039
were doing it and she was like how can I

01:15:32,389 --> 01:15:35,420
go do it I mean I don't think I want to

01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:37,099
do it none of my friends are doing it

01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:38,780
they all say there are just too few

01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:41,150
girls in the class and that's not worth

01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:45,170
doing it and fortunately there was a

01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:47,300
record not org you know local thing

01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:49,280
where they invited girls to come and

01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:51,710
have some you know to be exposed to

01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,389
various things she went there she did

01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:54,980
some of the design programs that they

01:15:53,389 --> 01:15:57,500
did and some of the coding that they had

01:15:54,980 --> 01:16:00,199
and she came back totally convinced that

01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:02,510
she wanted to do the java course so I

01:16:00,199 --> 01:16:04,219
really encourage all of you to start

01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:06,139
getting involved in those kinds of

01:16:04,219 --> 01:16:08,480
things where we expose our kids right in

01:16:06,139 --> 01:16:11,119
elementary school and middle school to

01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,559
you know the fun that is there in math

01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:15,409
and computer science that you know all

01:16:12,559 --> 01:16:22,250
of us experience on a daily basis thank

01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:23,929
you thank you well thank you ladies we

01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:25,969
went a little bit over and I hope we

01:16:23,929 --> 01:16:27,889
didn't encroach in other sessions I do

01:16:25,969 --> 01:16:29,840
want to end with a couple of points

01:16:27,889 --> 01:16:32,030
there is a birds of a feather tomorrow

01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,949
that's been added to the agenda at 2:10

01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:36,340
for those that want to continue the

01:16:33,949 --> 01:16:39,170
conversation we've opened it up to

01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:40,940
everyone at the conference so it would

01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:44,270
be an opportunity to have a really great

01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:46,579
open conversation we were also working

01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:48,920
