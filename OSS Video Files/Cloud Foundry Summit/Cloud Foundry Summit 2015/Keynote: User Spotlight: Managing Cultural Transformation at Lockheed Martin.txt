our next speakers are from Lockheed

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,580
Martin for those of you who may not know

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:18,390
what they do they have prepared a short

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:21,360
video for you technology that enables

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:26,200
cars to drive themselves

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,200
[Music]

00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,109
routine flights to Mars

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,750
fusion reactors that produce limitless

00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,750
energy

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,300
to most people they're pure science

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,330
fiction from the world of tomorrow like

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,700
something out of a movie

00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:55,809
but at Lockheed Martin we live on the

00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:59,720
cutting edge of physics material science

00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:02,449
technology and engineering we obsess

00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,150
over things most people only imagine

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:07,940
we're at the forefront of the science

00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,750
that makes them real and they're

00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,500
available when it matters most

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,530
[Music]

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,450
it's why we're always thinking about new

00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,000
ways to prevent the unthinkable

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,350
and building the most advanced fighter

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,350
the world has ever seen

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:32,230
it's how we redefined what a combat ship

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,230
looks like

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,810
why we're harnessing the tides to

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:42,370
generate electricity and protecting our

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:45,489
most valuable resources

00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,489
[Music]

00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:54,320
and while we don't know what's going to

00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:57,400
change the world next we're probably

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,400
already working on it

00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,180
[Music]

00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,770
[Applause]

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,840
so we have invited three speakers Kevin

00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,240
Carlson Christine chesnic and Cecil

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,980
Miller to please provide your insights

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:21,200
into Cloud Foundry from Lockheed Martin

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:23,500
come on thank you very much nice music

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,500
sting

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:32,020
[Music]

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,670
first of all thank you to Sam and thank

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,070
you to the Cloud Foundry foundation for

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,860
the opportunity to be here and thank you

00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,270
all for being here late on the second

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,350
day of the conference we're very excited

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,970
to share our story so you saw a little

00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,290
bit in the video about what Lockheed

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,540
Martin does and we're here to talk a

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,540
little bit more about what it's like to

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,710
work for Lockheed Martin honestly to cut

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,210
to the chase the best part is the

00:02:53,710 --> 00:03:02,470
employee discount we get on the f-35

00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:04,900
fighters but seriously we the partner

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:09,130
company we represent is the enterprise

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,750
IT organization so we're internal to the

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,709
corporation that our customer is

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,840
Lockheed Martin

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,060
they are very challenging customer

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,830
because as you've seen they do hard and

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,720
they do hard very well and they

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:25,690
understand complexity and they demand a

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,640
lot so what we want to talk about being

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,020
that we're not on as we've heard from a

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,340
number of speakers throughout the

00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,830
conference we're not on the revenue

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,780
generation side of the business

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,670
necessarily which means that when we

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,610
look at our operations we have a

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:42,040
constant demand and pressure to really

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:44,950
become more efficient and so some time

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,170
ago we stopped and really looked at you

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,550
know how we as an IT organization could

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,650
enhance the value that we were

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,420
delivering to the business and it

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,709
started with a couple of honest

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,690
admissions when we looked around we

00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,090
noticed that there was a lot of what

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,519
I'll call shadow IT so we have very

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,470
smart people lots of Engineers and some

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,320
of you may be familiar with the you know

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,030
paradigm that everybody's an IT guy but

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,350
the result of that at the end of the day

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,360
is there's a lot of different ways of

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,440
doing things you know in terms of

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,610
development that had to be suboptimal so

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,169
in order to kind of get our arms around

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,790
that we wanted to up our game in terms

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:21,100
of how we were engaging with the

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,690
business so we literally changed the

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,390
structure of our organization to play

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,180
man-to-man offense if you will with key

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,250
business stakeholders and in so doing we

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,070
learned a lot about what our

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,930
opportunities were to improve the first

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,110
thing we learned was that you know these

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,030
folks really enjoyed you know designing

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,920
solutions not surprising for engineers

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,810
right and they wanted to be intimate

00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,470
involving those solutions that impacted

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:50,680
the way they did work and they want a

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,360
capability sooner rather than later so

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,160
what that reveal to us is that you know

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,740
our processes were where we were

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,170
traditionally a waterfall shop were no

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,750
longer appropriate you know to meet the

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,660
needs of the business the other thing we

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,790
learned was folks one of the ability to

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,190
do work in many different fashions and

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,950
from many different locations so there

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,680
was this demand for mobile enablement

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,850
okay and it was that it was not an

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,950
afterthought but it was just a

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:22,020
characteristic of the solutions that we

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:25,870
supplied to them and finally we learned

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,810
again that our business folks are data

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,310
junkies they really want to leverage the

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,170
data that exists and that's being

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,530
created in these transactional system

00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:38,560
silos elevated up in a way that allows

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:41,080
us to generate new insights so we needed

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,400
an analysis platform that would assist

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,230
with that so that was a mouthful to hear

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,430
but it was a very good exchange over a

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,050
period of time that we had with the

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,400
business and so we had to figure out how

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,900
we would respond it made a lot of sense

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,670
based on what we were hearing that you

00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,560
know becoming more agile had to be

00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,350
somewhere in our response and we had to

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,760
address people process and technology

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,300
I'm sure you've all heard that adage

00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,800
before as importantly we recognize that

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,600
if we were to get there in the time that

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,810
we needed to we needed to partner with

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,010
another organization and we'll talk a

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,020
little bit about our partnership with

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,960
pivotal as we kind of embarked on this

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,640
journey but we knew that you know in in

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,020
jump-starting our agile process needed

00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,390
to include our business stakeholders

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,150
from start to finish and that took not

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,400
just reconditioning IT team but it's a

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,770
reconditioning our business teams as

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,500
well we knew that we needed to gain

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,170
exposure to new development technologies

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,450
so no longer what we're doing mainframe

00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,790
COBOL or you know ColdFusion or some of

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,740
the older platforms that you know we've

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,070
become honestly quite used to dealing

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,130
with and then third aspect is you know

00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:54,340
we want it to really in doing this

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:56,170
enable DevOps and at the same time

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,060
single-threaded news from our operation

00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,620
so this concept that we'll talk about a

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,500
little bit further pilot pair

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,240
programming is really important to us on

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,720
the technology side we needed to stand

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,580
up a pass development environment past

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,470
because if we were going to truly

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,330
transform our applications process and

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,040
make our developers more efficient we

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,570
need the ability to really be able to

00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,220
abstract them from the underlying

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,530
implementation details of the

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,900
infrastructure we had established that

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,360
toolset for complex analytics and paved

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,650
the way for the future demand that we

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,470
knew we'd be getting from the business

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,090
and then finally and most importantly we

00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,120
had to challenge the technical norms of

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,010
our existing culture so to talk a little

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,780
bit more about the relationship that we

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,040
established with pivotal and that's

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,990
Christine to come forward

00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:46,270
thank you Cecil so I was given the

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,720
privilege to be the project lead for

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:52,300
this effort and also the product manager

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:56,140
for the applications that we are

00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:59,020
starting to deploy and I guess one of

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,630
the things right is where do you start

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,970
right we just saw an awesome video right

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,520
that's motivating and exciting and it

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:10,420
makes me happy to say wow I work for a

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,180
company that can do that right it also

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:16,180
makes me motivated when we have a team

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,180
that is able to move forward and help

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:22,810
our organization and company also move

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,690
forward when the initiative was started

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,640
we had to figure out who are we going to

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,300
help right because this is what it's all

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,520
about

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,890
behind everything in that video is a

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,710
tool a process and a set of people that

00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:39,760
need to deliver business value every

00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,590
single day so one of the groups that we

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,410
collaborated with is our business

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,780
development group right they had a

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,180
cumbersome tool nobody is using it

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,970
executives aren't happy because they're

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,520
not getting the customer data that they

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,680
need to be able to make decisions right

00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:02,290
and we want business development to be

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:05,990
happy so as we listened to their user

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:08,900
story which is critical to the process

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,770
we identified this opportunity and we

00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,780
also started to condition them on what

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,180
this methodology and approach is going

00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,340
to be about we're not going to have a

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,260
requirement session and leave you for

00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,770
six months and come back and show you

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:28,600
some little prototype right as we're

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:31,610
gonna have you here with us daily weekly

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,720
helping us figure out what that solution

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:38,540
is and at the end of the day what we

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,340
heard was you got to make it intuitive

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,230
right you got to make it easy for these

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,680
road warriors to be able to get their

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:50,000
data in and move on to their next effort

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,250
it needs to be mobile and by the way it

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,170
needs to be able to be international

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,220
right our people are all over the world

00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:00,260
doing this work so what we did was we

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,840
engaged with pivotal labs including our

00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,030
business development rep and we spent a

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,480
few weeks down in Manhattan being

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:12,530
immersed in the agile process my team

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,870
and no exposure we heard of the word

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:18,470
agile we didn't know test-driven

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:21,080
development we didn't know see ICD so

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,960
we're excited because of all this new

00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,590
opportunity a little skeptical because

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:31,250
it sounds too good to be true but left

00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:34,210
becoming believers so while we're down

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:37,850
there being immersed in this culture

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:40,430
what we didn't realize was how ready we

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,010
were for that change right you don't

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:47,060
know what you don't know and what we

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:50,000
also started to realize was how within

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,890
our own organization people don't

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,590
realize how ready there are for this

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,140
change also and how do we start getting

00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,240
that knowledge transfer how do we value

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,550
lies that socialize that starting within

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,490
our own groups to be able to get that

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,250
support well you get the support by

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,800
proving that it works so we're in the

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,860
lab environment side by side with the

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,050
pivots have a requirement session coding

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,780
starts immediately and by the end of the

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,050
week we have a landing page and you know

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,380
features that we

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:27,000
actually work with very very powerful

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:29,310
concept for us to take back right not

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,610
eight months anymore hey in a week you

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,529
have something that you can work with we

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,700
did have a few challenges that we did

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,529
have to overcome that I'm going to

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,959
highlight just a couple of them I

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,519
already alluded to the learning curve

00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,920
that we have with all this new

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:50,730
technology and terminology that we had

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:52,769
to figure out solve and absorb one of

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,480
the most important ones that was

00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:58,019
critical to the success of our project

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,269
was figuring out paired programming it's

00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,070
easy when you're in the labs the pivots

00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,529
are next to you the developers are all

00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,120
next to each other communication tap on

00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:10,230
the shoulder here's a problem let's

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,810
solve it here's a bug but our code is

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,839
being developed in one place we need to

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:19,170
get our code into our lockheed-martin

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:23,130
environment and as you can imagine lucky

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:27,000
just doesn't grant access to anybody so

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:29,640
even if you get access you're not gonna

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,100
get that much so we had to figure out

00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,800
how are we gonna solve this to be able

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,170
to continue moving forward well we got

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,950
through that hurdle and here's the

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:43,079
second key one we work virtually our

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,740
development team is not next to each

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,140
other

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,589
my team is scattered all up and down the

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,720
East Coast so now we have remote pairing

00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:55,950
as we call it that needs to be solved

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:59,579
and how do you do that again we figured

00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:03,300
it out - took a little while but became

00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:06,839
very successful at that because virtual

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:10,649
pairing virtual work load isn't going to

00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,360
be changing for us so again a couple of

00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:16,170
highlights on some of those challenges

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,420
that we were able to overcome now the

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,310
one part that I'm leaving out though is

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,800
where is our customer in all of this

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:26,370
right because we also need to have their

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,529
support and yes they are in our retros

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,779
they are in our stand ups they are part

00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,720
of doing the user story acceptance

00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:35,130
testing with

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,160
right again to influence that

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,630
relationship and having them help

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,180
support our organization to be able to

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:48,150
go back and say wow I t's doing great

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:51,400
things go to them for for your needs

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:54,160
with that sad while we're in Manhattan

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,010
while we're working virtually building

00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,400
an application well we still need a

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,980
platform to host this application and

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,990
this is where my colleague Kevin Carlson

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:13,630
comes in and how he solved that for us

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:15,700
Thank You Christine so we saw a video

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,760
today and there's some pretty cool

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,040
technology in that video and I'm the

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,390
technical guy who had the opportunity

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,170
and privileged to help

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,730
deploy new technical solution in our

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,180
environment but what you also saw in

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,430
that video was we also have the

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,430
responsibility to protect some very

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:40,060
secret and sensitive data lives are on

00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:43,020
the line and with that Lockheed Martin

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:46,390
has built an ecosystem of people

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:50,050
processes and technology that delivers

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:52,260
that in a flawless manner that ecosystem

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,580
has been developed over many years and

00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,310
something we're very proud of internally

00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:02,050
and we were challenged with internally

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:04,180
on this project we had to transform we

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:08,130
had to come up with a way to technically

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:11,350
transform our IT processes and people

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:13,660
and in order to do this there were three

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:16,000
critical pillars starting with the

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,230
design when we went into the design

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,670
effort we looked at it from your

00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,270
traditional pre-production and

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:25,110
production design methodology we engaged

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,580
with pivotal to provide the stand up

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,050
capabilities and let me tell you we work

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,240
some late nights and I think some of you

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,160
are probably in the audience here and we

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,810
do appreciate those late nights and I

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,110
know a few of you were hungry on those

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,130
late nights so it was i but we couldn't

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,589
have done it without you

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:45,440
we also had to engage very closely with

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:47,449
our information security team you know

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,819
on the design of the infrastructure the

00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:53,839
networks the firewalls the new rules and

00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:57,050
processes we had to incorporate in new

00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:00,560
network technologies deploy new systems

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:03,230
deploy new firewalls deploy new routing

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,630
mechanisms all of this led to a level of

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,029
complexity that was really not

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,550
straightforward at the beginning our

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:13,069
network team was challenged with new

00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,850
ways to do things that were challenged

00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:18,740
with new firewall rules nat rules

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:22,699
translation between the visibility of

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,589
the systems and our external systems we

00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:26,120
had new operating systems involved no we

00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,930
could not deploy our hardened

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,170
lockheed-martin

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:33,470
OS with our great tool suite and our all

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:36,769
our other monitoring systems so we were

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:40,300
challenged and this really led to a risk

00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:43,190
management opportunity how do we

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,959
mitigate and manage risk in our

00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,569
environment what is the acceptable level

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,189
of risk in our environment what are some

00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:51,889
of the new processes and capabilities

00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:54,470
that you interject to enable technology

00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:56,329
and ultimately in our case we have to

00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,100
integrate with other production services

00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:00,529
whether that's your Active Directory for

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,870
single sign-on Federation services for

00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:06,350
sam'l other business applications that

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:08,630
are in production database connections

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:11,630
all of this led to a fairly complex

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,480
standup but what it also meant and most

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:17,600
importantly is a large shift in our

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,400
culture we had to change we had to get

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,059
beyond they're not asking the question

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,740
of what is pivotal Cloud Foundry what

00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:27,409
does that mean we had to get beyond that

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,200
we had to embrace automation we had to

00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:32,270
embrace change we had to think of new

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,669
processes we had to get out of that

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,799
gridlock of trying to take the

00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:40,159
tried-and-true the known and fit it into

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,650
this way to think outside the box those

00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:45,559
new tools terms and technology really

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:48,110
challenged our team you know and really

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,730
tried us to think inside to understand

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,350
really what does devops mean for

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,790
Lockheed Martin what does it mean for us

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,570
to be able to

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:59,900
secure our data and ultimately we've got

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:02,030
to provide a design that will evolve our

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,910
infrastructure evolves our technology

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:07,370
evolves our designs have to evolve we

00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,669
have to reduce complexity we have to

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,500
think smarter think faster try not to

00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:14,600
over engineer or a lot of engineers at

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,299
Lockheed Martin we like to do things in

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,500
an engineering manner

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:21,530
and ultimately we have to take our

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,600
culture and shift it to a point where we

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:27,350
can drive innovation drive business

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,030
value be able to execute quickly in a

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,720
cost-effective manner for our businesses

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:34,370
to stay competitive and with that I'd

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,400
like to hand you back to cecil miller to

00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:40,309
talk about some of our results thank you

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,590
Kevin so you heard us really kind of

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:44,770
frame a problem that we saw in the

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,610
delivery of IT services to our business

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,620
you've heard about our approach to

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,350
engage more tightly with our

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,580
stakeholders listen to what they had to

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,010
say and you heard some of the things

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,370
that we got back and then finally we

00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:01,730
talked about our approach to partnering

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:04,790
with your pivotal identifying a path to

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,200
agile and DevOps and some of the process

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,960
and technology challenges that we

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,370
overcame in doing so so now you're

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,690
probably wondering well what are the

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:16,760
results so I'm going to talk a little

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:19,010
about you know results this activity

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,780
which began by the way for us in October

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,720
of last year was really about proving

00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,130
out a concept you know typical of

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,080
Lockheed Martin we don't like to jump in

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,260
too quickly with both feet until we

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,850
understand that a concept will work so

00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,590
these results about how we prove the

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,850
concept we proved that we can partner in

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,320
a different way with the key business

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,169
stakeholder in this case our business

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,700
development organization we proved that

00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:42,200
we can initiate and sustain a

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,970
co-development engagement with an

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:49,580
external partner at their lab and in so

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,740
doing we accelerated the knowledge for

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,080
our development team project managers

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,460
around the methodologies that we would

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,080
need to put in place to drive that

00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,110
cultural evolution that we've described

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,640
to you on the technology side we're able

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,360
to stand up a secure pivotal Cloud

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,800
Foundry environment

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,110
and we're able to bring those aspects

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,030
together to complete a mobile

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,370
application for our business development

00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,290
team in ten weeks something that would

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:17,410
have taken us conservatively nine months

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:19,330
to do before so all those we believe our

00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:22,390
successes and it's excited as we are

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,340
about those successes we understand that

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,720
we are in it for the long haul and so

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,840
they you know we have to continue to

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,480
evolve and iterate and while we're using

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,730
the term agile you know it's not a

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,170
sprint it's a marathon for us and so we

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,790
have to continue to enhance our skills

00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:39,850
and capabilities in order to deliver

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:42,400
this this process and we have to

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,620
institutionalize these changes so in

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,090
fact we've now got an enclave of stuff

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,300
that's happening really really fast and

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,470
a whole lake of stuff that isn't so how

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,110
do you get the stuff in that lake

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,450
appropriately into that fast enclave if

00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,100
you will and finally we have to

00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:01,480
collaborate and share with other parts

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:03,520
of IT because we believe there are other

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,220
areas within the IT organization where

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,420
this approach would be beneficial but

00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,040
also other parts of the business so I

00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,320
talked a little bit earlier about how

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,090
we're not on the revenue generation side

00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,100
we think that these tools and this

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,770
capability could be incredibly powerful

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:22,150
in some of our and some of action or

00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:24,280
facing platform solutions so with that

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,600
we'd like to thank you all for being

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,840
here and for the opportunity to share

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,300
our story we're very excited to continue

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,450
our journey and we'll see you in the

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,049
cloud thank you

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,049
