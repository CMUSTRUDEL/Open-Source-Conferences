all right good afternoon everyone I'm

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,680
Manuel and I got we're going to talk

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,599
today about finding and organizing a

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,429
great Cloud Foundry user group

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,990
I got Animesh and Daniel from our team

00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,920
just to before we get started just a

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,380
little background on us

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,930
we work for ibm's open cloud

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,449
technologies organization and our

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,840
mission is to to do first-of-a-kind

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,269
open cloud projects engagements with

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,040
customers and then what we do is we take

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,500
that knowledge we take that experience

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,840
and we'll go out and try to give it back

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,870
feed it back to the community feed it

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,030
back to the development organizations

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,399
part of our develop part of our teams do

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,440
actual development on Cloud Foundry on

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,110
OpenStack on docker

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,000
but in addition beyond the working on on

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,309
specific contributions back to the

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,530
community we also try to give back to

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,140
users and people actually running

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,780
operators running the the technologies

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,960
and a couple of the ways we do that is

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,589
we specifically work with with the

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,950
summit's

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,320
try to give sessions try to give

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,420
feedback at the last OpenStack summit we

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,509
gave a couple talks on docker and

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,479
OpenStack at last year's Cloud Foundry

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,540
summit we talked about some some gave a

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,009
couple technical presentations next week

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,070
and OpenStack summit we have a couple

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,040
more but the the other big thing that we

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,520
do is we we run a bunch of meetups and

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,680
we try to touch touch the users of the

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,450
local users and try to get feedback and

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,329
also give them a lot of our experiences

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,979
so today we want to talk about the

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,460
specifically about meetups

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,369
and about how how you guys can can

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,899
create one if you if you're interested

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,470
in creating one or how you can

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,119
contribute to one okay what we're going

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,610
to learn today is well we're going to

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,790
talk about two big things will will will

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,149
try to teach you in sort of convey our

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,149
experiences but then also Animesh will

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,879
go through an example of a cloud foundry

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,910
summit I'm sorry a cloud foundry meetup

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,060
that he runs here in the Silicon Valley

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,590
so what will what will

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,720
with today Jan will start talking about

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,190
why meetups are so popular and why you

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,380
should get involved

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,290
we'll see where you can find active

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,420
local meetups and then finally if

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,459
there's nothing local no meetups that

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,680
are local to you how you can create how

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,390
you can organize and really the big

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,319
thing for us is how you can sustain a

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:37,450
strong community so before I continue I

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,080
just have a couple questions who here

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:43,090
has been to a Cloud Foundry Meetup

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,880
okay awesome and who here's been to any

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,930
Meetup - OpenStack cloud foundry alright

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,860
awesome and who here runs a meet-up

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,920
alright good

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:57,069
awesome that's great and so just a

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,870
little bit about us Dan runs the he

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,310
lives in in the East Coast he runs the

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,280
New York City Cloud Foundry meetup he

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,610
also runs the PHP meetup you also run a

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,830
an openstack meetup in New York City the

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,080
Cloud Foundry meetup has 643 members

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,750
he's been an organizer since March of

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,090
last year Anna mash runs one of the

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,140
biggest is that the biggest cloud

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,540
foundry meetup Haim and Dave by the way

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,720
here Dave Nielsen and they run they have

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,799
about 1,200 members he's been an

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,560
organizer since June 2014 Dave started

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,450
it before that I've been running the

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,290
Austin Cloud Foundry meetup since

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:41,290
January we've had two or three meet

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,900
meetups since then actually and Dave's

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,329
got done a couple workshops for us and

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,730
so so we we have were coming from a

00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:51,639
point of experience and our team itself

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,340
is running the Boston RTP and China

00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:58,150
meetups so we are our teams a lot of

00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,970
experience doing that so now let me hand

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:06,340
it off to Dan so he can walk us through

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:09,400
this you mean okay

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,680
Thank You Manuel so I was glad to see

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,180
that several people have actually

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,730
attended meetups but for those who

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,220
haven't been part of them meetups

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,930
actually have a history a root in

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,489
computer user groups that have been

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,720
around for almost 50 years

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,640
there's every time there's been

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,140
technology out there there's usually

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,800
been a group that's been founded to

00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,159
basically how

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,409
people use that in fact IBM runs still

00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:35,470
one of the oldest user groups out there

00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:38,319
which is share shared org for 50 years

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,729
it's just continually been operating to

00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,000
to help folks learn about IBM

00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:45,819
technologies meetups they're they're

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,990
basically about once a month events that

00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:53,169
just repeat in either the local venue or

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,729
a restaurant or or some office usually

00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,840
pretty informal they have a simple

00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:01,389
speaker they're scheduled after work

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,580
hours but there's no real hard and fast

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:07,449
rules around them you'll see a great

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,250
variety of companies hosting really

00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,990
elaborate meetups like Netflix and they

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,210
do it maybe once quarterly or once every

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,159
six months and then you have some other

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,409
folks that do it twice a month just a

00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:21,280
repeating meet-up sort of a an office

00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:22,750
hours type of approach so there's

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,430
there's plenty of different formats for

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:30,430
what's out there here's an example of a

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,770
good meet-up content that's it's

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,180
probably the prototypical example of the

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,090
ones we've been running and the ones

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,940
we've seen here's one I ran at this last

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,740
year we announced IBM an open-source

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,199
project that we donated to the Cloud

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,199
Foundry community called the admin UI so

00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,159
basically I did it one our talk

00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,380
introducing the local community that

00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,610
wasn't at the summit to that technology

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:57,610
try to get some of the feedback and some

00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,199
some contributors some comments on it to

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,449
basically get them aware of the project

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,300
and involved in it and and involved in

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:05,469
the greater Cloud Foundry community so

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,569
it's just a Wednesday evening

00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:09,580
presentation at pivotal labs in New York

00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,039
City they've got a great little kitchen

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,370
area just a little bit of networking

00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:17,080
meeting some people beforehand going

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,210
into the presentation and then following

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,830
it with questions and post meeting

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,830
conversation drinks things like that

00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:28,150
okay so if you're new to meetups

00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:30,759
probably there particularly with Cloud

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,219
Foundry it's a great way outside of

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,199
these once yearly summits to actually go

00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:37,899
learn about Cloud Foundry kind of build

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,360
on what you've learned here it's a

00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,639
pretty complex project it's

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,490
sophisticated highly

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,189
tributed you'll want to basically see a

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,099
demo talk to some local experts and as

00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:50,199
you continue to go to meetups you'll

00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:52,699
you'll learn more about the technology

00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,979
you'll have some questions for local

00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,870
subject matter experts that you can put

00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:58,279
out there and you'll basically build up

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,039
a network of people that you can rely on

00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:03,020
and build up your own skills and in fact

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,210
as with all of us now that we organize

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,120
cloud foundry meetups um we've been able

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,699
to establish local expertise areas in

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,199
cloud foundry which is in turn helped a

00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,939
lot of the companies that are in the

00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,229
foundation find new talent in the area

00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:19,729
around the country and around the world

00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:23,270
so how do you actually find one of these

00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:25,460
meetups meetup comm has become the go-to

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,710
place the first thing you do if you

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,680
haven't already after this talk go up to

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,419
meetup calm sign-in and just basically

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,129
fill out a profile set up some of your

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,719
keywords Cloud Foundry is one of the

00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,870
keywords that are up there

00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:40,610
there's also related topic topics like

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,080
platforms of service I as OpenStack

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,789
things like that

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,439
that may be relevant to to what you're

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:48,080
interested in that's specific to cloud

00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,689
foundry or more broadly about cloud

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,050
computing they also have a very good

00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,580
search interface you can find if you

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,990
happen to be you know traveling you can

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,250
also find something in an area that

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,629
you're going to and as you you know set

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,389
up your meeting profile and you join

00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:07,039
groups not necessarily attend meetups

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,139
but join these groups on meetup calm

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,360
you'll find a network of people that are

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,589
interested in related topics so it's

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,899
very helpful for learning about new

00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:17,839
technologies things that are emerging

00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:20,000
and learning about related groups here

00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,069
for example here's there's someone here

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,539
that I didn't realize there was an

00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:26,360
Apache maze this user group in New York

00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:30,580
my joining the user group by finding out

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,580
that this guy was RSVP for my events

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,570
okay so if you don't actually find

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,039
anything in your area then you know it

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,229
depends you know if you're not in a

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,769
major metropolitan area you may not find

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:45,170
an existing Cloud Foundry Group and you

00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:47,600
may want to start a new one but I would

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,339
we would advise really that you you look

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,510
for something thats related to Cloud

00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,670
Foundry

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,529
and actually be very specific that you

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,839
don't find an existing cloud foundry

00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:58,940
group one of the problems we do see an

00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,860
anti-pattern with meetups is people get

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,930
excited about the technology they rush

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,190
home they set up a user group but they

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,410
don't realize there's an existing one in

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,810
their town that's got existing people in

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,579
it looking for speakers looking for

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,000
venues they kind of go their own way and

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:16,010
then do one Meetup and then they abandon

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,360
been in the other group so you want to

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,100
make sure you're you're building on

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,800
whatever community that is there and you

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,870
may have to expand that out so maybe not

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,089
Cloud Foundry but maybe paths or a cloud

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,829
computing user group look for OpenStack

00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:31,040
groups those are actually one of the the

00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:32,209
closest open-source projects to Platte

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,680
foundry so if you can find one of those

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:36,350
you can finally usually find in

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,329
overlapping communities and in fact the

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:42,470
OpenStack user group how-to is a great

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:44,570
resource for helping you you find some

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:51,350
of those tips you'll see that bitly link

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:53,149
later as well but OS - ug - tips okay so

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,190
if there's no cloud or foundry group in

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,860
your area go ahead you know try to find

00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,089
a sponsor or a venue to host it it's

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,910
your own company whether it's a local

00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:04,069
university and then get started with a

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,660
topic and a speaker make sure that

00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:07,730
you're you're not scheduling something

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,500
at the same time as for example Cloud

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,470
Foundry summit you know where people may

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,970
not be in the area and ensure that

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,500
you're not conflicting with holidays

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,810
things like that we find that August

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,279
November December terrible times to hold

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,319
meet up to the most part just because

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,990
the holidays and the close of business

00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:25,839
that's usually happening and a Tuesday

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,220
Wednesday Thursday evening or perfect

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,569
fourth Tuesday of the month has been my

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,959
my go-to scheduling for the wealth card

00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:35,269
okay

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,370
so as you become an organizer of these

00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,230
meetups there's four patterns that we've

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,610
basically been seeing that have been the

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:45,230
best practices so any great meetup and

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,480
any great organization that you can

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,940
sustain over time each meetup has great

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,399
content really relevant to your local

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,740
audience you've got great speakers

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,620
either one or a panel or a lightening

00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,589
talk format they've got a great venue

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,630
that's very welcoming not that hard to

00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:04,040
find you know it's sometimes like

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,949
pivotal labs which is one of my favor

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,600
venues here in San Francisco and in New

00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:10,310
York is they've got an open kitchen you

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,100
can go grab a drink have a bite and then

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,420
the the open area with the brand-new

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,589
media equipment is right there for the

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,480
talk

00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,040
and then great attendance so all of that

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,079
is kind of useless if you don't have

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,630
people that are regularly attending

00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,029
learning and building the community so

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,190
I'll go into each of these four topics

00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:29,449
in a little more detail and then at the

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,259
end of the talk Animesh will actually

00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:35,959
show how he put these into action okay

00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,300
so as you're setting up your user group

00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:40,310
one of the very first great topics to

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,420
start with is everybody wants to see

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,459
everyone wants to know what Cloud

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,160
Foundry is so if you start with the talk

00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:48,139
on the architecture and a demo that

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,569
tends to be a very good beachhead for

00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,130
starting up a brand new group if you

00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:53,269
want to do it yourself coming back after

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,029
this conference with what you've learned

00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:58,190
that's a great way to start as your

00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:59,990
local group evolves people always want

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,850
to know right after they learn about

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,230
technology is okay so how do I use it

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:07,190
what's the best way to apply it in my

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:09,829
company so customer use stories and use

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,350
cases are great follow on topic and

00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:15,230
we're always looking for those and

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,760
finally another great topic to start

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,860
with is the integration with OpenStack

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,829
so you can't run Cloud Foundry in a

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,209
vacuum you need an underlying

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:24,649
infrastructure to run it on and of

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:27,050
course there's always interest in docker

00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:28,850
as an alternative platform as a service

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,930
so there's plenty of integrations as you

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,180
may have seen at this conference already

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,279
with docker that you can use as a

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,930
starting point those tend to be actually

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,190
our most popular meetups the OpenStack

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,310
in New York the New York City Cloud

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:45,290
Foundry one drawing 100 over 100 people

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:47,779
each time ok and to kind of drive to

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,250
those those those topics I'm actually

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,079
one of the best place to find a speaker

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,360
for your you're either next meetup your

00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,209
first meetup if you heard a great talk

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,100
here some time from a from great speaker

00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,959
these are ones that we've had at our

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,829
meetups Cornelia Davis from pivitol

00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,600
Renee Welch's from sa P and Sam Ramsey

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,819
of course has been the emcee for the

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,310
event go talk to them ask them they're

00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:12,740
gonna be in your area and see if they'll

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:16,089
willing to reprise the talk or talk on

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,089
something specific to your group

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,080
and again you know you're at Cloud

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,180
Foundry summit there's a lot of

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,100
companies that have bet their future on

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,010
Cloud Foundry so they have an interest

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,020
in building great user groups and

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,700
organizations in their area go talk to

00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:34,130
them see if you can find if they have an

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,340
office in your town see if they can host

00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:39,680
their sponsor meetup in in New York and

00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:42,110
in San Francisco for example pivotal and

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,210
IBM we've been great hosts for us we've

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,680
also had some folks from the local

00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,330
university community that are interested

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,360
in learning we hosted at Pace University

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,440
Dave did a workshop for them on how to

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,150
push your first Cloud Foundry

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,370
application that was very well received

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:58,430
and of course Alto Rose has been a great

00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,810
partner in spreading a lot of user

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:05,810
groups throughout the United States and

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:08,630
into Eastern Europe as well ok so again

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:10,040
you really want to find the most

00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,890
attendees see if you can get a lot of

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,660
people into your meetup group you'll

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,820
notice with meetup it's there's very low

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,210
barrier to joining groups so you may get

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,180
a lot of RSVPs for an event but it may

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,100
turn out to get a low turnout generally

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,580
don't don't get discouraged by that it's

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,290
usually about 30% 40% feel like 80 RSVPs

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,850
to get like 30 people actually show up

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,010
there's a lot of factors that go into

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:37,100
that there's weather there's timing

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,140
don't be discouraged by it but you know

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,240
try to embrace that part of meetup and

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,620
be as open get a lot of people involved

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,940
in your group so if they can't come to

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,320
this event they may come to a future

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,540
want to event and they want to know

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,670
what's going on you'll want to be able

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,590
to promote the event through Twitter and

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:55,040
announce it in a cadence up to your

00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:57,320
event again the open source user group

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,080
tips page excellent for helping you for

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,990
example schedule tweets a week out two

00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,390
weeks out things like that and giving

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:08,420
you a good format for engaging people a

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:10,640
great first place to start and of course

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,140
at the presentation before the

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,060
presentation two minutes before the

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,620
presentation people are always in ask

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,200
for the slides the recording and

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,250
possibly streaming so think about you

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,800
know preparing those things in advance

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,480
but also if you have the collateral that

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,130
comes out of each Meetup people love to

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,960
see the pictures they love to have the

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,000
slides and it makes them more likely to

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,389
come to future events to be part of that

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,800
and that that helps not only your local

00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,850
group but expand throughout and that's

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,319
one of the things actually that's

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,279
animation has been very successful at

00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:41,930
that's helped him build the community as

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:46,610
well as he has along with Dave and this

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:48,399
look at the Silicon Valley area okay so

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,779
just to wrap up on organizing a group

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,100
don't underestimate the effort like I

00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,569
said like a lot of people they get

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,250
excited after going to a conference like

00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:57,740
this and you know they really want to

00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,269
get going but it does take quite a bit

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,680
of effort to sustain a group you want to

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:04,160
make sure that you engage people in your

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,689
community you find Co people from

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,129
different companies or within your own

00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:08,509
organization that are willing to be part

00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:10,189
of that community to help you run it

00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,170
you're not going to be able to host each

00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:15,490
event it's a lot of work to organize

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:18,019
speakers lineup venues capture video

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,310
take pictures tweet whatever during an

00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,649
event you want to make sure that you

00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,389
once you establish that beachhead you've

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,230
got you know a bunch of other folks in

00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:27,139
the pina they're gonna be able to help

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,439
you out so you want to be the catalyst

00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:31,519
you don't want to be basically the

00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:34,100
keystone of the whole thing that if you

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,449
go away it goes away that's really not

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,449
good for the community you know as an

00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:40,879
open source as with meetups and there's

00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:43,459
a great place to pick up some more tips

00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,370
on organizing meetups hear from Mike

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:47,750
Schinkel I don't follow these to the tee

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,000
there's some things in there I think are

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,730
a little controversial some people are

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,050
they get upset about people RSVP'ing and

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,139
not showing up you know it's hard to

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,480
plan about food or drinks he recommends

00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:02,269
for example a nominal feed RSVP of like

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,769
five dollars I don't like that idea it

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:05,780
just kind of is against the spirit of

00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,640
open source even though people are more

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,990
likely to commit to actually showing up

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,120
if you you know they've got some skin in

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,220
the game but otherwise there's a great

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,799
bunch of tips on there on that and the

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:19,579
OpenStack meetup group tips are are

00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,500
fantastic okay so I'm gonna hand it over

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:24,409
to Animesh he's gonna take those four

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,720
great patterns pack practices and show

00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:28,850
you how he used them to basically build

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,320
his own career build up the community in

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,320
the cloud in the Silicon Valley area

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,240
yeah I think Daniel gave great tips

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,270
aren't all to run meetups where to find

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,560
guidance when to

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:48,480
schedule what to look out for one thing

00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,610
which I do want to elaborate on first is

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,040
why because I think why is important

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,920
right why you should be running meetups

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,110
what is in it for you and you and you

00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,730
and part of that is you know at the end

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,850
of the day we all have our day jobs and

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,520
we can only spare so much time an effort

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,550
into something which is truly altruistic

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,080
in nature so around 2 years ago when I

00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,540
was giving some technical presentations

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,800
by the way I work for IBM so was giving

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,690
some technical presentations and I

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,970
realized I really liked doing it

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,980
I really like you know taking technical

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,050
knowledge and spreading it and making

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,310
folks aware of it but then your

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,990
day-to-day pressures of delivering

00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,910
technical projects being on meetings

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,700
writing status reports doesn't give me a

00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,500
time that was the time I wished you know

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,970
there were many versions of me many

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,780
clones of me which can actually do that

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,760
on my behalf

00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,850
and I let you know meetups actually

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,640
enabled me to do that and let's see how

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:44,220
so at the beginning of last year when I

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,370
was asked to run a meter around cloud 40

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,920
and bluemix in Silicon Valley to begin

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,570
with I was a bit apprehensive first

00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,210
thing is I mean it was a relatively new

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,430
venture for me and specifically also

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,480
Silicon Valley is a unique place you

00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,660
know there are thousands of small

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,370
startups were there there are companies

00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,230
which began very humbly and went on to

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,540
become ultra successful but it's very

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,490
complicated place and to stand out you

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,730
need to be on your feet always learning

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:14,490
and always motivated right so I began

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,320
searching for my motivation the fact

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,330
that I was working on and I am working

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,180
on IBM bluemix which is an open source

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:23,490
platform cloud for Murray and it's

00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,350
targeted towards developers convinced me

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,140
that this is something I needed to talk

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,670
about at an organic level I needed to

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,190
reach out to the grassroot developers

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,990
and have folks and communicate the

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,610
message around bluemix around Cloud

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,970
Foundry so that was definitely one

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:41,100
motivation the second thing which

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,990
motivated me was a great organizational

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,650
culture in place within our organization

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,540
or VP angel Dyess was heading our group

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,600
he also gave a keynote yesterday around

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,280
bluemix and cloud foundry he's a great

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,770
champion of meetups he has a worldwide

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,070
team which is running meetups across the

00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,080
world

00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:01,220
around Cloud Foundry OpenStack docker

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,950
and he really supports and in fact

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:07,649
incentivizes and rewards that initiative

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,659
as you can see I'm bhima's we are

00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:12,749
running cloud 40 meters in Silicon

00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:15,659
Valley in East Coast in Austin Boston

00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:17,879
area you name it we are all across the

00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:19,379
world even in OpenStack meetup groups we

00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:22,139
are partnering in a lot of them in

00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:23,970
Austin in Philadelphia Connecticut we

00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:26,159
did some meetups with OpenStack meetup

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,710
group here and we are participating in

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,389
docker user groups as well so that was

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,889
there was a good motivation as well and

00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:35,119
I knew that this is something I

00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:37,499
definitely wanted to do going forward

00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,840
the other thing which you see with

00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:41,009
respect to bluemix as I mentioned since

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,080
it's a platform which is targeted

00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:44,849
towards developers there was a great

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,279
realization within the organization that

00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:49,499
we needed to grow it add the organic at

00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,739
the grassroots level so if you see there

00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:54,629
are around 14,000 or 15,000 people who

00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:58,529
are actually participating in bluemix

00:20:54,629 --> 00:21:00,509
meetup groups across 81 cities in around

00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:02,489
30 plus countries so that's a huge

00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:08,759
initiative and all that within a period

00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:11,999
of one year so gay I knew I wanted to do

00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:13,229
it but you really get what you want as

00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,179
is right and you need to get a bit

00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:16,710
innovative to get there so the first

00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:18,539
thing I wanted to do in Silicon Valley

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,669
was find if there is a crowdfunding

00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:22,710
meetup group there was one Dave Nilsson

00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:25,200
who actually started that it had around

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,580
200 odd members at that time I did reach

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,759
out to Dave so that's an interesting

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,649
story and Dave being busy as he is he

00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,899
didn't I mean he probably didn't see the

00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:36,269
email he didn't reply and around a month

00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:38,429
later I got a mail from meetup calm that

00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:42,029
the meetup group is being shut down

00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:44,220
because nobody is kind of stepping up to

00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:47,039
be an organizer I saw the great

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,679
opportunity got myself signed up became

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,629
the organizer Dave came to know of it

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,179
and he was obviously not happy why did

00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:55,649
you do that I said that's the message I

00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,599
got from meetup.com and since I was

00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,259
starting I didn't know what happened in

00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,479
the background

00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,950
apparently meetup.com was sending him

00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:04,169
remind us that there was some news

00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,599
because he knew to pay a monthly fee

00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:08,970
which keeps on varying it's around $12

00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,970
$15 which he forgot right I mean he was

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,490
not seeing those emails

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,080
I kind of explained or gave me got on

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,360
the same page and they're often started

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,470
my journey so that was one thing which I

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,960
did and the second thing was definitely

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:23,680
I started a bluemix meetup group from

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,840
scratch in the area so okay now I have a

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,870
meetup group to schedule my meetups the

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,520
second thing is I needed to hit a home

00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,830
run in the first pitch right so that

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,630
means I needed to schedule the first

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,680
couple of meetups and I wanted them to

00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,970
be big get a lot of members in so as to

00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,970
develop that early reputation in the

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,650
community now how many of you would go

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,140
to watch a movie just because at home

00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:50,050
Cruise or a Brad Peters in it right a

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,970
lot of us right so going by that analogy

00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:54,700
I realized that you know sometimes there

00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,500
are superstars in the community and no

00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,660
matter what the content is if you just

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,550
get them in your meetup groups you are

00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,260
actually ensuring a big big attendance

00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,690
so that's why it is started what I

00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,670
started with feral rod in us actually

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,670
got him to do a meet-up around docker

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,500
and cloud foundry and Thiago and in this

00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,000
case the content was also good Ferran is

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,000
very popular in the community and it

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,320
ensured huge audience that followed up

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,630
with the Cloud Foundry and OpenStack

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,430
meetup which again was a big success and

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:24,820
with these couple of meetups I think the

00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:26,110
path was set I got a good reputation in

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,720
the community in terms of you know being

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,940
able to schedule and doing successful

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,770
natives going forward and thereafter

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,090
just couple of weeks ago Sam Ramsey was

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,730
in one of our meetups as well talking

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:38,590
about the CF summit and this superstar

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,710
doesn't always need to be a person right

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,090
you can form collaborative partnerships

00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,490
with other meetup groups which are

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,470
hugely popular for example the OpenStack

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:50,440
meet a broken Silicon Valley that has

00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:52,990
around 6,000 members so if you think of

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,640
it that way apart from the 1,200 members

00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,560
which we have got in our meetup group we

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,630
are reaching out to 6,000 other people

00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,520
and telling hey we are scheduling this

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:02,710
and if you're topping intersexed that's

00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,120
a great opportunity to get huge number

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,520
of people also educated about your

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,860
meetup group so definitely do that we

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,270
did the same thing with the big data

00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,160
developers meetup group because one of

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,200
the things bluemix has is a big

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,150
ecosystem of services which span the

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,830
whole big data arena so whenever we

00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,610
schedule a meet-up which actually went

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,470
into that side

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,910
we formed partnership with the big data

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:24,570
developers meetup group again it has

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:28,630
around 4,000 to 5,000

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:31,690
and definitely coming back to my movie

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,490
analogy right there are times when you

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,410
actually go to a movie not because of

00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,390
the superstar but because of the content

00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:40,120
right so if you have a very strong

00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,220
content lot of time folks actually flop

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,370
just for that right so docker has been

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,110
as we all know it has seen huge momentum

00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:50,170
right so anything around cloud foundry

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,660
and docker and Iago that was a huge hit

00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:55,270
OpenStack it's the most successful open

00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,919
source project of the Linux right so

00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,750
that's something whenever we scheduled a

00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:00,850
topic around cloud 40 and OpenStack

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:04,960
intersection it actually got is like

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:06,160
huge huge appreciation so these are some

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,950
of the sample contents right you can

00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,100
talk about Bosh how does Bosh works with

00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:13,360
Californian OpenStack and it always

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,740
doesn't have to be

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,870
what does cloud phone they integrate

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,120
with right whether it's OpenStack a

00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:21,100
docker the fact which we forget is float

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,900
for ease an app platform so you can

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,030
actually go forward with a lot of very

00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,549
cool apps you can create apps around

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,950
ecosystem of services for example a

00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:31,720
couple of meters which we did was around

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,700
Internet of Things so building apps and

00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,980
bluemix and tying it up with our

00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,080
Internet of Things service again great

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,730
response there was similar one which we

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,590
did around Watson services and bluemix

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,120
which are available so you can actually

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,980
take that whole route where you're

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,110
actually building apps on top of Cloud

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,240
Foundry tying it with the ecosystem of

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,980
services and educating people about that

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,530
rather than always going into the

00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:57,540
internals and talking about how does it

00:25:53,530 --> 00:26:00,130
integrate with other technologies right

00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,900
so you have the speaker you have the

00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:04,179
content but one thing which we forget

00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,040
right I mean if we don't know and again

00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:07,419
I am going back to my movie analogy if

00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,630
you don't know a movie is coming next

00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:12,970
week we won't turn up right so we often

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,220
forget but it's very very very important

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,260
that we spread awareness about it so one

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,200
of the things which we actually which I

00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,400
personally do is ask my co-presenters of

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,110
presenters who are coming to the meetup

00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,179
to prepare the slides of week in advance

00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,070
and what I start doing is once the

00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:28,900
slides are in I start taking screen

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,490
screenshots of certain slides which are

00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,040
very attractive which kind of give an

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,910
idea about the content and then start

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,490
tweeting about them

00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,240
posting them on LinkedIn creating a blog

00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,200
or

00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:43,360
them so and then even ask my other

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,870
meetup organising sister actually send a

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,120
mail with that slide you know screenshot

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:51,550
into that so the whole goal is get the

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,890
audience excited or create cheeses and

00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:56,470
use social media very very smartly in

00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,000
this case to make sure the folks are

00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:02,100
aware that there is a meet-up happening

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,100
around this topic so that they turn up

00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:09,760
okay so and finally you know what are

00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,520
the rewards right I mean yes pairing

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,290
this much effort in time and most of us

00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,060
do apart from our day jobs I mean there

00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,790
are a few who actually run meetups and

00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,260
and that's something which they do for a

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,090
living but if you see most of the meetup

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,460
groups folks are doing outside their day

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,530
job so one of the great thing which I

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,270
have found you know is that the live

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,890
feedback which you get from audience be

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,720
it a technology you are proposing be it

00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,030
a product build a solution you are

00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,220
talking about and an app demo you get

00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,320
very early feedback in terms of whether

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,030
it's going route right is there

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,310
something wrong in it should we take it

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,930
in a certain direction so if you want to

00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,640
get early perception and if you want to

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,920
feel what's the audience position about

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,450
certain things in the market start

00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,700
taking it in meetups first you know

00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,280
you'll start getting those feedbacks and

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,960
as you can see I got feedback from all

00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,700
across the world from London from China

00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,320
and part of the reason was that we were

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,510
making efforts to actually live stream

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,260
our meetups all across so a lot of

00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:08,350
people were actually joining remotely

00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:10,090
and then another reward is you know in

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:13,510
turn you are building your own personal

00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:15,640
eminence and brand that has happened

00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,680
within the last six months three of our

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,600
slide shares they actually ended up

00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,670
being the most talked about content

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,170
technical content on Twitter so I got

00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,790
these emails from Twitter there this is

00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,770
the most talked about technical content

00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:29,260
on Twitter and they were actually posted

00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,520
on SlideShare homepage so come to think

00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,620
of it you are also building your own

00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,450
personal eminence and brand as you go

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,370
through it and you are being featured on

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,590
the SlideShare homepage Twitter is

00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:42,580
actually spreading and it advertising

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:44,860
your own content so and and the reason

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,410
it was happened as we post these content

00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,450
on SlideShare we go out humongous

00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:52,030
response as you can see we have gotten

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,890
around 60,000 views

00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,890
or content from the meetups has been

00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:59,200
tweeted around more than 7,000 times

00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:01,800
with the potential of reach of 1.5

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,180
million now if you think of it right

00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,830
meetup is a very casual activity where

00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,390
you go and present something in front of

00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,550
100 member audience and that's what you

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,980
plan for but if you think of the reach

00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:14,620
if you do it in the right way and when I

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,210
say the right way is give enough time on

00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,280
your content so that it doesn't need a

00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,110
speaker to be standing behind it the

00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,780
content should be self-explanatory on

00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:24,670
its own and if it is it has a shelf life

00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,070
which is much much much beyond your

00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,810
meter so definitely make sure you're

00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:30,370
building your content in a way and then

00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,170
spreading that through the social media

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,210
because of each you can get as much

00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:37,510
beyond where a single event can get you

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:39,400
and finally as I said about the

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,840
organizational culture if it's in place

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,000
if you have a good organizational

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,920
culture you will be recognized and

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,990
rewarded for that and I did get

00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,480
recognition and rewards within IBM

00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,700
because of these efforts so make sure

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,990
you know your team is behind it and they

00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,580
are recognizing all the hard works you

00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:58,570
are putting into it and that will act as

00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:01,240
a motivation to you as well I think the

00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:03,700
last part as you know as all along while

00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,380
you're doing it you're doing it you are

00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,640
making some great friends as you are

00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,980
going through it

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,140
you're meeting some great people making

00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,360
some great friends making great

00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:16,480
connections while having beer and pizza

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,070
and food right so it's a no-brainer

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,110
so definitely you should get involved

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,180
into this create meetup groups in your

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,090
areas get involved in them if you don't

00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,560
want to run definitely join them and

00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,370
build your skills as well as you go

00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,940
along with that I'll just pass on to

00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,940
Manuel to wrap

00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,909
and why you should get involved we also

00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:47,399
want to show you where you can find the

00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:49,529
local meetup go to meetup.com and

00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,779
finally we wanted to really talk about

00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:54,899
how you can organize and how you can

00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:57,749
sustain a community and really this is

00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:59,929
all about a community and giving back so

00:30:57,749 --> 00:31:02,369
again here are the links to our to our

00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:03,840
presentations and our twitter handles

00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:05,789
and one last thing

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,850
IBM is hiring so if anyone's interested

00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:10,350
come talk to us right I don't think we

00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,119
have any time for questions but we'll be

00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,330
around and we'll answer all your

00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,330
