well I'm the only one bringing up papers

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,919
I'm the only one needs notes evidently

00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:09,330
so I'll explain that first so for those

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,280
of you that know me some of you work

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,290
with me I have some my team out there I

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,870
always tell them there's like five

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,880
voices going on inside my head so I

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,949
never know where I'm gonna go so anytime

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,300
I get off center I used my notes to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,210
bring me back on and you'll see

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,140
throughout this 15 minutes that I'm not

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,869
exaggerating really what I wanted to

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,520
talk to everybody about was it is a

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,700
ninety-year-old company that I'm working

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,129
for right now all state deep-rooted

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,879
culture but what's gonna go up on the

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,370
slides is not just about Allstate it's

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,989
about I'd say every place I've ever

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,989
worked and if you know my background

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,860
huge financial institution two or three

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,899
of those huge online payment institution

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,660
even though it was a in Silicon Valley

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,090
it was still a 15 year old company they

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,989
all suffer from this right the lack of a

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,479
platform to drive change and then comes

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,229
along Cloud Foundry

00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:12,420
all right PCF great platform for a

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,799
technologist but even better for

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,810
somebody that wants to change an

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,590
industry and change the way a company

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,700
thinks kind of a scary conversation

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,340
internally at all-state mainly because

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,640
we started this journey with small team

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,900
internal team talking about how to drive

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,710
business as a technology not let

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,560
business drive the technology and for 90

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,689
years all states made money that very

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
well they're on an upward trend they're

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,560
seeing growth for the first time for the

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,020
last five years for the first time for a

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,810
five-year cycle stocks higher than it's

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,310
ever been so you sit back with business

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,829
and say guess well we got to disrupt

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,350
this whole thing and tear it out it's a

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,619
hard argument right we're gonna go to

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,360
technology driven products we're going

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,680
to change the way you think the way that

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,719
you deliver you're going to sit right

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,209
next to the developers we're gonna give

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,979
you a platform to do proof of concept

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,500
real-time to sit there and

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,569
live the life of the customer no longer

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,730
are you doing a waterfall approach no

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,890
longer are you waiting six months to

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,440
launch products you're gonna conceive

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,680
the product on a Monday and launch it on

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,590
a Friday right that usually took nine

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,299
months at best so a tough argument

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,950
especially when you're making money and

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:37,590
the stocks higher than it's ever been

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,190
so here's the history all right it's a

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,519
good story

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,220
it's a great story actually and by the

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,959
way that's half the story there's a

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,150
whole claim side of the house we do

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,010
18,000 claims a day and it's not on the

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,440
chart we actually have the largest

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,760
roadside assistance program the second

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,819
largest in the United States behind

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,829
Triple A so the numbers are huge the

00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:02,970
business is grown in every aspect not

00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:03,720
just core insurance products but we need

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,760
to change

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,739
why because everybody's going to disrupt

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,150
the insurance industry hasn't been

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:14,910
disrupted in 80 plus years again go back

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,319
we need the platform to do it I've

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,780
talked to a lot of my peers that have

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:25,590
been with Allstate way longer than me

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:28,799
and you get into this dialogue of we've

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,280
always done it this way it's been proven

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,109
makes money stocks at $70 it's great

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,049
argument all right

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:40,049
Google's in 40 states now I think they

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,690
can actually aggregate insurance 18

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,730
months ago they weren't in any right

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,560
this is going to be disruptive this

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,530
industry is going to see an uber like

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,919
this rupture at the speed and pace that

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,349
we can't react so we go out and find a

00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:59,359
platform to help us deliver something

00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:03,180
that in the past we never could have

00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:05,250
right you take a look at this and I did

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,750
say it's saying Allstate up there you

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,930
can say this about any enterprise that

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,959
I've ever worked with or been a part of

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,699
right this is the culture of about 90%

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,989
of those and I'm sure some of you are in

00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:21,630
oh right they look back it's a lot it's

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,910
a tough word lack of ownership but it's

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,310
everybody owns

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,140
but nobody's really accountable right

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,730
you have sixteen sign offs to do

00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,060
anything well that's a financial

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,710
approval or a technology approval they

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,140
have huge engineering boards to get

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,450
together architectural boards they all

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,960
talk about what to do we changed all of

00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,270
that

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,790
we made decisions I don't know it's

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,410
probably been about six months ago to go

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,240
down this pivotal Cloud Foundry route

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,450
and by the way we went down the Cloud

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,160
Foundry route and as we were my boss

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,380
said you need to also change all

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,460
development methodology so as an

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,740
infrastructure focused technologist me

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,720
and my team now run the change of the

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,330
developer methodology on the platform

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,790
because we saw the capabilities that the

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,370
platform could enable not only deliver

00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,850
in our services but product for the

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:16,070
business and looking at the way the team

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,400
embraced it and delivered it in such a

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:22,360
short period of time making technology

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,640
the business he put us over top of

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,170
actually development not infrastructure

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,630
development not frameworks

00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,490
these are development labs we're

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,680
pounding out code for the business now

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,320
on our platform it's a little different

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,620
model we changed a lot of models by the

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,260
way I'm not going to speak to every one

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,080
of these bullets the one that I will did

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:49,520
I already did I will point out strong

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:54,350
aversion to risk right you have an

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:57,560
entire company that is run by actuaries

00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:00,020
basically so everything has this huge

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,990
formula behind it and I'm serious

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,790
everything that you do and you're trying

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,620
to predict every every possible scenario

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,760
and there's always the one that stands

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,310
up in the room and says well what about

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,640
right to get the decision center all the

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,080
way back to square one how we deliver

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,750
things so it is a very risk-averse

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,280
company at this point in time but we're

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:25,100
driving change this is our process today

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,040
this is how we deliver technology by the

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,450
way the best case is probably 90 days I

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,210
got some of my team right here they'll

00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,000
keep me

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:36,909
the best case is probably ninety days

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,150
average is a hundred and eighty or so

00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:42,189
and that's to get the technology

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,900
delivered not the product not the

00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,520
business product that's a workable

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,240
environment that somebody's pounding out

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:55,300
code we plan on taking that down from

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:57,819
quarters or months days to minutes we've

00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,860
already proven we can stood up pivotal

00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,169
Cloud Foundry in a lab pretty much the

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,659
same day that we brought it in wrote the

00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,610
hello world app got that in front of

00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:07,810
everybody stood up on stage when we

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,419
brought it in in front of leadership

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,800
including business leadership showing

00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:15,879
them that we can provision an

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,909
environment in 15 minutes from zero to

00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,580
15 this is zero to everything in 15 now

00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:23,770
it's what do you put on top of that what

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,020
else are you going to enable with that

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,629
kind of power and how are you going to

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,520
get them to think different because

00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:32,409
you're going to transition a little this

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,060
is the other side of my those voices

00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:38,529
going on technology is cool it's great

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,509
Cloud Foundry does what they say it's

00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:42,250
going to do you have to have the people

00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:44,560
in and around it to believe in it and

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:48,339
deliver on top of it and you have to

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:53,550
change every single process eighty five

00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:57,250
years plus of process built in into an

00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:00,400
institution to basically stop that and

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:03,039
make it slower don't go to fifteen

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,629
minutes make sure that somebody makes a

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,150
decision before you go to the next phase

00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:08,979
make sure you have 16 people in to make

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,599
a decision to go to the next phase and

00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:14,919
we're saying we want to empower a

00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:17,409
developer to hit a button deploy it sit

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,379
with a product manager and have a viable

00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:23,560
minimal Viable Product up and running

00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:24,879
within five to seven days the insurance

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,310
industry is interesting because you

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,020
could do things state-by-state imagine

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,360
if you can release a product that you

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,649
thought of on a Monday into one state

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,930
that Friday that would change the

00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,510
industry because right now waits to get

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,600
all 50 states approval that could take a

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,190
year

00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,450
oh yeah I'm not telling you guys

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,480
anything no you all you all have

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,910
insurance you know the pain the customer

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,020
sees open the policy and the paperwork

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,600
you have to go through and everything

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,300
else right we're trying to change that

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,960
it'd be nice for one one button on a

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:03,770
mobile phone but you need the platform

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:07,450
so we're getting rid of that why I think

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:13,340
I talked a little bit about it right

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:15,080
cost is not necessarily the focus right

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,910
I think there's a lot of people get

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,980
caught up in when you're delivering a

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:22,900
platform like this you're delivering it

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:26,480
looking at cost cost is gonna fall out

00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:31,520
my opinion costs gonna fall out the back

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,350
end the way we justified our proof of

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,790
concept for lack of a better term it's

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,890
probably the most expensive proof of

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,930
concept I've ever been involved in we

00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,280
sort of jumped in off with both feet and

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,740
decided to skip the proof-of-concept

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,960
pace and went straight that we're gonna

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:49,460
do this we're gonna sort of tear the

00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:53,120
band-aid off and just go I sold it to

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:56,630
the executives at the table that our

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,910
developers are inefficient and if they

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,400
had developers inefficient by not but

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,230
not their own cause right they go to

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,330
meetings it's just our culture you go to

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,100
a meeting they plan it they're not

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,600
pounding out code they're not doing

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,840
anything they don't have a platform to

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,310
provision they come in they wait a month

00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,070
before they can actually do anything

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,980
because go back to that one screen don't

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,800
really go back to that one screen takes

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,320
90 days to get them environment to work

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,500
and how I get them working the same day

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,270
within 15 minutes because we can do

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,530
push-button deploy they can come in and

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,530
do it themselves so they do it wrong

00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,530
they can blow it away they can rebuild

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:38,960
we put the power in the developers hands

00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:40,670
the ripple effect of that is changing

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,640
the methodology now since we have a

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:46,310
platform we get the developer working

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,370
different we get testing done different

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,770
right test-driven development I don't

00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,530
have a huge group of testers anymore

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,720
well won't right they'll go down the

00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:59,360
path of

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,399
right then you get into not only the

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,379
testing side of the house you take a

00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,310
look at everything by the way that

00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:10,009
delivery of the services took me 11 PMS

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:13,670
to run that just the process right

00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:16,519
platform enables me to eliminate all the

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,850
inefficiencies that I have buried in an

00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:23,149
85 year old company the other side of it

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,649
is risk gets rid of delivery risk you

00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,110
have everybody sitting at the table that

00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,970
you need to deliver what you need the

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,610
first time and as quickly as possible

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,980
and fix forward there's no longer

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,379
defects making it in all the way up

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,310
through into production at the rate that

00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:42,709
they were you get you get what I want to

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:45,920
say you get an iterated iteration that

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:47,689
you can fix forward more quickly right

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,209
to eliminate the risk there's not a risk

00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:52,610
of missing deadlines anymore right again

00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:57,290
small portion of the portfolio right now

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,329
and I mentioned the time time waits the

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:05,300
money usually and it'll fall out of the

00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:07,880
back end here's the journey which is

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:11,449
interesting take the take the technology

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:15,079
aside for right now and then 85 year old

00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:17,329
company to be able to deliver what we're

00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:20,420
talking about and the time that we're

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:21,949
talking about that we've gotta figure

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,819
this out and I'd be the left side for

00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:28,160
you guys the left side of that screen is

00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:31,160
the old you know that's what everybody

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,370
doesn't like to call the legacy that by

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,100
the way that's 85 to 90% of the money

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:40,430
that we're making right now sits in that

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:43,899
old process and we're trying to shift it

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:45,350
to the right to build quick deliver fast

00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,899
higher-quality

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,420
write more efficient across the board

00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,459
from the infrastructure up so there's

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,379
some kind of operating model here where

00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:56,449
we're starting to test I've already sort

00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,089
of ripped the cover off of it with my

00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:03,170
organization we went into a bimodal or

00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:04,699
trimodal organization where I have one

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,980
side of my organization watching the

00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:08,060
left side of that chart one side

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,220
watching the right

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,220
we're currently we just reorganized a

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,780
week and a half ago we're in talks of do

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,550
we have to put somebody in between to do

00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,230
some kind of open API or something that

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,030
we can actually mask the old and present

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,520
it as services to the news without it we

00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,200
need a third organization in the

00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,120
organization announcement it basically

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,830
said just get used to it this is a snap

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,070
the line we're gonna change again very

00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,540
soon so be comfortable with that

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:36,920
it's that same kind of approach that the

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:40,060
entire enterprise needs to take on right

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:43,580
I think this morning what was it

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:46,100
agile scrum fall I feel like that's

00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,740
where we are right now and we're still

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,400
talking about how to get out of that the

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:57,670
good news is we've now delivered process

00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:01,220
in the infrastructure delivery teams and

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:05,060
around architecture and around approvals

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:08,840
to deliver higher up in the platform

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:11,690
capabilities through Cloud Foundry at a

00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,450
much more rapid pace so we're starting

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:18,800
to show the rest of the organization

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:21,140
what the potential is and it doesn't

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,050
come with some risks we will break

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:27,290
things right so there is a common

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,030
conversation on what is decentralized

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,990
what is doesn't have so many tentacles

00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:34,820
tied into the left side of that legacy

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:38,660
organization that you can deliver on a

00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,520
standalone platform right again don't

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,290
forget we have roadside assist we have

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,140
other products other than insurance so

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,150
we can go out and iterate on them learn

00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:51,340
change the process change the delivery

00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,340
mechanisms and go from there

00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:00,220
key message a large organization slow to

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,950
progress it's not a key message that's

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,240
that's the challenge really we're trying

00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:10,240
to get rid of that we're trying to bring

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,600
everything through a technology platform

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,050
and have everybody look at it and say

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,940
why can't I do my job that way I forget

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,040
where I was earlier we were talking

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,760
about how do you change the rest of the

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,000
process

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,370
I made the presentation to a technology

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,829
group the business and all of our

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,529
support organizations in the first two

00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:35,740
minutes of the presentation legal stood

00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:39,220
up and compliance stood up and said we

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:42,279
can't do any of that and I said well we

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,649
have an hour plan my job here is done

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,360
is you saying that tells me that you

00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:49,990
completely understand what we're trying

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:54,250
to do and your process needs to change

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:56,500
and we were done presentation over now

00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:00,610
they're calling me saying how do I get

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,470
involved how do I change it if you think

00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,940
about the financial approval process

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,800
that sits in front of almost everything

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,420
that at least we do and I'm sure all you

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:13,449
fill it it's not at all in place to

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,220
react to anything like this right we do

00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:18,339
roadside assist we only do roadside

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,199
assist in North America right now that's

00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:22,899
only because we're in North America

00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:28,420
insurance company we could take that

00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:31,390
anywhere we'd go global overnight why

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:35,170
wouldn't we think of the scale of that

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:37,180
we couldn't scale the date of that we

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,949
have no ability to do that we could do

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,250
it in every single country around the

00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:46,170
world tomorrow and we're an inhibitor

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:49,600
not anymore right that excuse was gone

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:53,800
we now have the platform we can do it

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,600
now it's the business it's not us we get

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,760
to sit with the business tell them we

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,029
have the capability we've proven it

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,800
we've shown it we have two apps going

00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:04,839
live on the platform here in the next

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,430
month or so we've even shown them that

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,550
we can develop with a new method

00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:11,559
so now the balls in their court so now

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:14,470
we get to drive the business as a

00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:18,430
technology company not an old insurance

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:21,610
company driven by actuaries so that was

00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:24,939
our goal I'm not going to go through any

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:29,010
of these the one there's two key points

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:32,820
there the hundred days down two minutes

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:37,210
right we've shown that capability twice

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:39,670
right I've seen it done that in a

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:43,090
developer's hands is what Cloud Foundry

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:45,550
gives us and as we build more services

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,210
and bring in from the community more

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:51,760
services and capabilities that empowers

00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,850
not only the developers and empowers the

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,000
business into new businesses into new

00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,520
countries and the new capabilities so

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,400
the excitement for us working at an old

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,800
insurance company is we get to go to

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,559
battle with just about any company in

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,720
the world with ten billion miles of data

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,970
from driving from people driving around

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,040
here we have more data than we need and

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,980
we can drive new industries and not only

00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,880
change the insurance industry with that

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,010
I appreciate everybody listening and I

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:31,619
thank you for your time

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:31,619
