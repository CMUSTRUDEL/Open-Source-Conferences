so first let me say thank you it's great

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,919
to see a full house here especially day

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,590
two at the end of the summit and I think

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,420
it just is a testament to the excitement

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,210
that's building up around this community

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,690
and clearly an exciting action-packed

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,390
two days a lot a lot of things and I

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,330
know many of you don't know me but I'm

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:29,099
excited and I will show you the face of

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:32,579
excitement that is the face of

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,219
excitement but I am excited and I'll

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,430
tell you why in a couple minutes all

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,559
right

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,270
and so that's me on Twitter so you know

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,030
as we look at the world today more and

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,239
more applications are being published

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,820
and pushed to clouds the concept of the

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,399
data center is fading into the past

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,280
right on premise data center

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,600
client/server we've now emerged into the

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,660
world of cloud computing and mobile

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,940
access to that right so more and more

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,739
applications today and the growth of

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,700
these applications are growing at double

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,320
digits cloud native applications but

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,650
there's this perception that all clouds

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,450
are created equal and some customers and

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,790
especially some of the early adopters

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,520
are finding out that that may not

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,299
necessarily be true in some cases they

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,259
are and in many cases they're not so

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:32,689
this notion of a Cloud Foundry is

00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:35,790
compelling and profound and critical to

00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:38,729
cloud native applications and it's

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,680
critical for a multi cloud world if the

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,500
world devolves into a single cloud

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,180
provider we don't need Cloud Foundry

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,090
right because it's a single uniform

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,000
homogeneous cloud but the world will be

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,009
multi cloud Cloud Foundry is a critical

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,470
part of that and you here in this

00:01:53,009 --> 00:02:01,469
audience can help make the difference

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:03,390
I'm convinced 133 percent then 140

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,000
percent confident in five years time

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,670
will look back on the this community

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,190
here and say these folks here have

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,620
changed the world so you can make the

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,709
difference and as a result all

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:21,180
native applications can be deployed via

00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:23,910
a Cloud Foundry so a little you know

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:29,640
quick background about myself started at

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:32,040
AMC 1985 believe it or not engineer

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,470
number five at the company and I've been

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,849
in data storage development up until

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,700
about seven eight months ago and I

00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:46,049
started at EMC when I was right out of

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,450
preschool and have been doing product

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,370
development and then I jumped I took the

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,440
red pill I call it if you watch the

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,319
movie The Matrix so I took the red pill

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,299
in October and it's been quite the ride

00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,860
and now I'm kind of looking at the world

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,180
from a different side kind of from the

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,370
platform down instead of the

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,790
infrastructure off so I can look you in

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:11,400
the eye and say I have seen clouds from

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:13,620
both sides now so now I drew the cut

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,079
line at 40 I know where you all are

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,239
sitting although all the Millennials are

00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,850
like what is he talking about so there's

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,880
this if you're millennial there's Joni

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,489
Mitchell back in the 70s and she sang

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,019
about cloud illusions and there are

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,840
illusions about cloud there are

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,340
perceptions about clouds and customers

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,829
experience are different than their

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,230
perceptions the perceptions are that

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:40,170
they're created equal and clouds never

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,639
come down right I turn a cloud off on it

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,489
and should never never ever come down

00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,780
and our data is safe in the cloud right

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,489
I put it there don't have to worry about

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,859
backup and things like that because when

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,870
I put it there it's always there

00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:54,630
regardless of what my retention policies

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,180
are and I can save money in the cloud

00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,389
right but customers are finding out hey

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,819
that stove is hot and when I touch it I

00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,650
can burn my hand and sometimes it's

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,980
painful once I'm into a cloud

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,470
infrastructure it's hard to get out and

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,870
that is a picture of me when I started

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:16,950
at EMC I just brought it along just to

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,950
prove the point so I asked this question

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:22,320
about a month ago John Rose our CTO is

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,820
here he held a summit technical

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,480
Leadership Summit for all our

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,180
distinguished engineers and fellows

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,070
at EMC and I pose this question what

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,100
differentiates a good cloud from a bad

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,960
cloud and there's roughly about a

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,430
hundred and fifty people in the room and

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,870
I got a lot of different answers and

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,670
attributes of what does differentiate

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,100
and it means different things to

00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,170
different people right I can run my

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,690
workloads and it's predictable I got a

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,460
great user experience I can meet my

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,250
recovery time objectives

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,530
I have great performance or good fishin

00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,930
C or ease of use it's easy for me to

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,780
deploy my applications into the cloud I

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,430
don't have to worry about security I get

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,280
business value out of that

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,040
so many things to many people and the

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,050
answer is all of the above right these

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,270
are the attributes that the customers

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,210
and people that are publishing

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:19,490
applications to clouds worry about and

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,160
it's really the quality of service that

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,190
you get out of the service and the

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,100
service provider that you have quality

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,890
not in the sense that it works right or

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,720
availability quality and in the sense of

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:36,200
the quality and the value that you get

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,820
in your experience and how you do

00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,360
business with your cloud service

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,360
providers

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:51,260
how many have written is command okay so

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,880
question when you push your app does do

00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:57,680
you push it to a good cloud or a bad

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,510
cloud or how do you know right how can I

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,110
be confident than when I'm writing that

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:06,139
command I'm pushing to the right cloud

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:09,229
right based on my governance risk and

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:11,410
compliance policies based on my business

00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:14,540
requirements you know whether it be

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,220
retention policies or whatever right so

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,830
this is what I mean by the

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,190
differentiation of good clouds and bad

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:25,070
clouds so I have a dream I am sticking

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:28,639
with this 60s and 70s theme here today

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:31,700
so I have a dream when we look when I

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,190
look at this community and the things

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,970
that we hopefully are about to achieve

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:40,550
and so what if we are you as customers

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:45,169
could deploy and manage all IT

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:48,260
applications and services on to any is

00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:50,750
stack easily and consistently with

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,970
confidence that it meets all your

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,440
business objectives all right so there's

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,650
a lot of breakouts about what

00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,150
applications are good for Cloud Foundry

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,950
right what applications are good to run

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,930
on certain types of clouds whether they

00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:06,440
be on premise or off premise hybrid

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,630
clouds right and so what if we could

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,010
solve this problem holistically so we

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,620
didn't have to care and we didn't have

00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,690
to differentiate and when we pushed in

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,030
published applications we didn't have to

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,250
worry about the fact that our business

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,660
requirements may or may not be met and

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:25,130
what if we could understand this upfront

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,080
right instead of finding out the hard

00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:32,090
way and finding out that that stove is

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:37,430
hot when we touch that so I have a wish

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:40,550
list for 2015 for the community and part

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,789
of that wish list I have like three

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:47,030
three requests there's this challenge

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:49,639
with non twelve factor applications and

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,729
persistent data what if we could solve

00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,830
this problem holistically right and we

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:57,559
can expand the set of applications that

00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,689
can be deployed to clouds

00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:02,269
not just stateless apps with stateful

00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:05,059
apps and do that in a holistic way more

00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:07,729
like a software-defined way right what

00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:10,149
is what if I could solve that problem of

00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:13,429
persistent storage and provide

00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:17,899
persistent data services around that and

00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:20,349
do that in the DevOps lifecycle versus

00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:21,949
having to stand up persistent storage

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:24,889
you know later

00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:28,159
you know later down the chain so what if

00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:32,120
we could solve that problem deploy it as

00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:35,389
software up front and I'll come back to

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,610
that in a minute number two is what if

00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:40,159
we had an open industry marketplace for

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:43,759
paths and I asked micro services and

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,649
software the benefit of the marketplace

00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,600
is I can go into the marketplace and I

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,509
can see that the chocolate is next to

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,069
the peanut butter right and when I see

00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:56,170
the chocolate next to the peanut butter

00:08:52,069 --> 00:09:00,620
I can do different things with that

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,990
versus today you know we have chocolate

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,589
in one marketplace and peanut butter in

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,559
another

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:10,579
so what if we had an open marketplace

00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:13,009
approach to Cloud Foundry if there is

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,589
only one cloud provider that starts with

00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:19,490
an A if you look at their marketplace

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:21,319
its one-stop-shop for software all right

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,680
and the Chocolate is next to the peanut

00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:27,139
butter right and we can do a lot better

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,839
if we can start to look at what services

00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:32,569
and software that we can offer in a

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
marketplace it's available to all all

00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:35,959
right so some of the challenges that

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,360
that that we have I think as an industry

00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,879
is getting to that right because we

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,350
still are competitors partners in the

00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,569
industry we have our own different

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,720
approaches things are different

00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:50,029
you know priorities but we also don't

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,059
offer a place in which any independent

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:55,870
software vendor can publish software

00:09:53,059 --> 00:10:01,289
into our marketplace per se

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:04,929
whereas the public cloud does

00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:10,089
and what if that marketplace included

00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:12,039
not just passed but I asked and EMC

00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:14,169
being obviously a data storage and

00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,059
infrastructure company what if some of

00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:19,749
the services are micro services I guess

00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:22,029
it's an overused term but things that

00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:24,819
are kind of thinner deployed as software

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:27,429
or stood up as a service what if we

00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:29,889
could deploy persistent storage services

00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:32,499
or micro services not just for block and

00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:35,859
volumes right but solve that problem

00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:38,919
holistically around file around object

00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:41,889
and if we know that we've got walking

00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:46,059
blocks of flash that are closely that's

00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:48,399
a W boss for technical term but if we

00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:50,589
had lots of flash closely coupled with

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,169
complete compute could we do some

00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:58,089
interesting things up front could we

00:10:53,169 --> 00:11:00,759
deploy in memory no sequel could we do

00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:03,939
that better having that knowledge what

00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:06,909
if we could integrate backup and deploy

00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:09,369
backup as a service much more

00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:11,109
efficiently and effectively or reduce

00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:14,259
some of the replication into a thinner

00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:16,359
set of services to either replicate at a

00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:19,209
VM level or maybe even a container level

00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:21,339
what about data security things like

00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:23,859
data shredding if I'm moving my

00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:26,409
information like if I use Cloud Foundry

00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:29,019
for portability of my applications and

00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:32,199
content and I move that how can I be

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:34,959
certain that I shred that data so data

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:37,409
shredding we used to call that data

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,850
corruption in the data storage industry

00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:41,619
but there are capabilities that we can

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,529
bring to bear to ensure that you're

00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:47,649
meeting your compliance requirements for

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:51,429
data what about mobility and access and

00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:54,489
things like active data or migration

00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:58,119
capabilities that were offered or data

00:11:54,489 --> 00:12:01,179
optimization right there's service

00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:05,109
providers offering offering elastic

00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:08,049
block or elastic file on flash what if

00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:10,239
we optimize for that because we know

00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:10,990
that not all information is created

00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:14,230
equally

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:17,100
and what if we provide data

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:21,340
deduplication services on top of that

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:24,160
and then finally what if we work better

00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,230
together with the OpenStack community if

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,480
you look at the the two big open-source

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,090
barbells or the ends of the barbell in

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,180
the industry with OpenStack

00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:36,550
at the IIST level Cloud Foundry at the

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,680
platform level what if we work better

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,380
together to provide a service catalog

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,570
that could be offered up and we could do

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,360
a better job of application workload

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,730
placement based on the requirements of

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:54,580
the application right and do that

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:56,830
effectively to iose clouds and if we did

00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,380
this could we further change the world

00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:02,170
I'm convinced we're gonna look back five

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,270
years from now and say wow you know look

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,700
at what was done by this community it

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:09,340
established a critical component of

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,950
cloud architectures and it's called

00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:14,020
Cloud Foundry and I fundamentally

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:17,320
believe that we can change the world

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:20,740
with that so to help

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,960
EMC in March mid-march it was roughly

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,270
about two months after the formation of

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,900
the Cloud Foundry Foundation announced

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:31,830
the first Cloud Foundry dojo this is

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:36,880
going to be in Cambridge Massachusetts

00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:38,950
co-located with our team from our CTO if

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,050
it's also in a great community right

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,110
right next to MIT there's Google there's

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:47,140
Microsoft nerds in the neighborhood so

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,120
it's a lot of great innovation and

00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,400
incubation ground so that opens mid

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,680
summer of this year we'll be able to

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,970
bring developers in go through the

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,720
6-week program

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:01,000
dojo program for paired programming and

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,630
test-driven development and you can

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:11,250
follow us on twitter at emc CF dojo or

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:15,520
email us at CF dojo at EMC com

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:17,170
so in conclusion more and more

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,960
applications are being pushed and

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:23,050
published to clouds the model is off

00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,649
premise the concept of the data center

00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,990
as fast becoming an artifact of the past

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:31,870
so Cloud Foundry is transformational it

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,910
is a critical component as we look

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:37,540
forward this community is making the

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:40,180
difference and as a result of that we

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,850
will be able to change the world thank

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:46,209
you for your participation here and

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,070
going forward and also thanks for

00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:49,110
participating in the conference today

00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,789
thank you

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,789
