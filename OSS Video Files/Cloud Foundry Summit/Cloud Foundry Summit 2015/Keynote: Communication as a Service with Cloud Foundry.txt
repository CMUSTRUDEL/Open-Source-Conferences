	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,509
good morning everyone my name is Alicia

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,379
I'm the chief architect of pest platform

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,710
out of our way

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,290
as some just mentioned that yesterday we

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,840
officially join the foundation as a gold

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:20,070
member there's no better time thank you

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,720
so there's no better time for me to

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,760
stand here to talk about halfway there

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,830
talking about how is past platform what

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,840
are we doing there and talk about our

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,730
experience with Cloud Foundry yeah so

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,370
our pet platform actually support

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,219
multiple scenarios while the scenario is

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,469
a cast communication as a service which

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:45,690
I will focus a nibble on for today just

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:48,690
morning now first of all about far away

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,309
how many of you heard or know about far

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,870
away before not today not to yesterday

00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:55,920
that's good it's more than I expected

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,460
it's great

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,739
but anyway Huawei was founded in 1987 in

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,070
Shenzhen China as the telecom equipment

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,110
maker so traditionally were hardware

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,799
companies but we still make a lot of

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,280
hardware's

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,030
but last 8 28 years the company has

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,450
grown to a leading global ICT company

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,670
but ICT I mean the information and

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,330
communication technologies so how we

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,220
provide wireless wireline and network

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,650
services Network a product and network

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,500
solution but also applied Enterprise IT

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,380
technology such as storage we have our

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,470
own database and storage services

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,170
computer server and enter in data center

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,930
management solutions so as you see from

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:48,899
this slide last year year 2014 we have

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:51,720
our revenue rich 46 billion dollars we

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:55,649
really growing fast but in the last year

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,149
we have about 170,000 employee we are

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,310
one of the big company in China of

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:05,369
course we want to become the India

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:08,759
globally so today the company is in the

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,860
middle of transformation we start a

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,830
couple years ago as many of you know

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,460
already the cloud computing

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,610
big data the IOT has significantly

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,770
impacted telecom industries our custom

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,110
telecom service provider day one SDM

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,810
software defined Network they wanna

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,040
watch analyze their network of functions

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,800
they want to use on the computer our

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,360
computing model to manage the network to

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,200
control the network which they have

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,350
appeared over years they wanna open up

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,180
existing network capability quickly to

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,850
the users to more to reach more

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,600
developers they want to quickly develop

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,300
new apps new network function apps the

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,450
word they can expose to to the users to

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,790
developers now we what we want to need

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:01,080
innovations we want to help our customer

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:03,990
to realize the Sdn and NFV visions now

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,520
we have a strategy called soft car now

00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,600
soft comm is an open network

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,160
architecture will abstract they've

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,770
functors network function from the

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,120
hardware so we're talking about

00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,340
software-defined switches so we're

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
talking about software-defined routers

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,580
we're talking about a software-defined

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,530
fair wars authority for everything

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,630
so those server network function as a

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,310
server as advocating they were run on

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,060
the cloud infrastructures and the

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,160
manager by the platform that's the soft

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,250
convergence the only hope our customer

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:43,890
to realize that it's giving Sdn and NFV

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:46,170
visions now how old is related to cloud

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,330
foundry you know after all this is a

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,510
cloud foundry Summit right and we got to

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,930
talk about cloud foundry analytic

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,520
experience a history with cloud foundry

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,260
although we joined the cloud foundry as

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,420
a government boy yesterday officially

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,440
but our experience with cough and

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,330
actually started back in 2013 where we

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,420
have a group of people about 50 people

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,489
working on the cloud foundry in the play

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,790
where there's play with the player one

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,890
with cloud foundry the last year we

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,230
released an internal version of our past

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,600
platform we called mushroom cloud that's

00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,039
based on cloud foundry

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,370
what you'll see in this slide is a

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,180
homepage of the mushroom cloud if you

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,070
can read the

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:34,770
word if you can read the homepage let me

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:37,350
know besides the number the so far we

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:41,070
have more than 4800 applications

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,050
employee we have more than 35 users as a

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,080
register that the go to mushroom clouds

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,280
that deploy the applications the manage

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,710
the applications the monitor

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,039
applications although those applications

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,050
are not production applications yet but

00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,300
we really see a tremendous interest in

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,669
our platform we really see a tremendous

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,130
increase in the cloud foundry

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,970
technologies people want to know most

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,590
cloud foundry

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,580
what's the architecture how they work

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,889
together can this scale yeah can how to

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,509
monitor the applications so we see a

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:19,759
tremendous interest in the cloud foundry

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:22,320
in within our companies now back to you

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,020
our scenarios I mentioned earlier that

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,639
we support many scenarios now each

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,919
scenario print has a different set of

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,960
challenges of course the you know

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,760
different scenarios now today I want to

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,580
share some of the challenge with you and

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,220
hopefully in the future works through

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,349
the communities we can resolve or solve

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,470
address hominins challenges that we are

00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:45,810
facing today now in the NFA scenario

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,360
where the past managed the lifecycle of

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,000
NFA applications now in this scenario

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,010
the NFA application is very sensitive to

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,250
the network status because there are

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,949
Network applications so how where to

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,199
deploy test applications hominy sense of

00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:03,630
a deploy and where to deploy how to

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,630
deploy is actually governed by a model

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,150
and that's different than as unique and

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,490
it's different than traditional IT web

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,970
applications and that's a challenge of

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:17,909
ours too additionally most of NFA

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,229
applications they are distributed

00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:22,199
complicated application was the multiple

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:24,870
components even will deploy each

00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,039
components a container then that's kind

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,050
of a need to communicate each other

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,650
right they need to communicate each

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:35,159
other directly without HTTP protocol

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,930
because their network functions another

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:39,360
one big challenge it to us is the

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,680
monitoring systems

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,830
from each and every application died

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,710
from this detection all the way to four

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,750
recover he needs to happen in seconds if

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,940
not meaning seconds because there are

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,610
nine work applications so we're not

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:58,690
cannot just monitoring the resource like

00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,610
CPU memory and i/o we need to monitoring

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,890
the performance the application process

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,620
indicator like a response time in order

00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:09,100
to response to achieve that monitoring

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,260
goals seconds and ears communicating

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,030
that service which are escape or talk

00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:19,540
about later on this like and many other

00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:22,000
big ite enterprise IT we have internally

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,669
we have thousands of occasions every day

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,700
we have hundreds applications in the

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:30,130
queue to be deployed to the upgrade so

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,400
in the IITs owners the large-scale

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,020
deployment the performance speed how

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,160
fast they can t-bone is the key to our

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:41,350
IT scenario can we deploy sweet Henry or

00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,700
four hundred containers per minute can

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,750
we do that can we have a hundreds of

00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,640
deployment request the same time for

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,210
different applications can we do that

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,479
those are telling it to us and it's our

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:58,570
customers still last balinese is a far

00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:00,850
away public cloud as some of you that

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:04,060
what we were a large public cloud

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,760
services later this year our pet

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,169
platform actually more power and support

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,750
a public cloud which you've already

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:14,050
decided but the same time we faced many

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,930
challenges one of it and so I have

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,910
public experience personally the manager

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,100
public cloud is a huge undertaking to us

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,900
so we want to make sure the past

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,729
platform the platform will build the

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,870
Aerie component has to be secured

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:31,120
independently an Arri component has has

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,659
reliable under stress an IRA component

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,210
can has a HEA design with others you

00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,870
cannot manage a public cloud is critical

00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,870
it's important

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,410
now let's focus on a little real

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,410
scenarios that simple scenarios the

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,630
cat's communication and service Kathy is

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,180
not new there are quite a few uh

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,760
cloud-based the cast service out there

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,160
now we want like we want to share our

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,500
cast experience how our platform and the

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,300
co-founder play a role in the cast our

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:10,730
all solutions so what's the problem

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,790
which other solve I mentioned earlier

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,060
the cloud computing the Internet has

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,320
significant impact on economy tasker's

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:22,100
traditionally for enterprises to build a

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,010
voice a video enable applications is a

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,670
long process so how quickly niigata's

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,740
cabinets out there for app to use to

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,900
build a enable the communication you

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,580
neighbor application that's the problem

00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,470
that we try to solve and this scenario

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,430
set us off and our paths are gonna be

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,610
part of their solutions so what is their

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:45,680
solution now we start with the simple

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,170
part effective solutions we have it you

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,900
can review the solution two layers one

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,540
is the cat API layer which is hosted on

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,900
the platform in the cloud the second

00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:01,250
layer is cast backend where he resided

00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:04,010
in telecom network in promise so it's

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:08,330
kind of a hybrid cloud but with the

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:10,940
cache API the users the developers can

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,890
discover this API can subscribe you can

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:17,300
just use it as assemble as develop other

00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:24,380
applications so how you can secondly

00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:26,000
using it so we have a build a cat API

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,760
surface the broker using cloth on your

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,070
servers the broker mechanism with cats

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,010
API service broker we have a catalog API

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:36,830
the developer can go there to browse the

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,410
catalog applause the API to subscribe

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:42,590
the API they need to and they don't have

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:45,110
subscribe Oh API and our past platform

00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:47,750
we will create the API instance service

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,380
instance and the monitor the API they

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:54,810
for them after they subscribe the API of

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:58,020
course we were scary if you need to

00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:00,630
now another part of important part of

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,580
the solution is we have integrated API

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,490
management solution which is based on

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:09,060
open source the integrate into the cast

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:13,530
API layer so that we can secure throttle

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:16,440
the API we can monitor API SOA this is

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:19,500
very important if you open up your API

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:24,290
in the cloud the security this rod Oni

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,290
and the manage the SOA is so important

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:31,350
now I want to show you a few skills in

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:34,500
this scenarios in cats and youth kids so

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:37,380
it's very simple the point here is you

00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,810
can build a worse enable application in

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,500
our thief in 9 minutes just called the

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,630
cat's API through the URL and the past

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,400
cats back in and we'll take care of the

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,230
call put a number you put there in your

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,310
applications and you can schedule the

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,410
call anytime

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,180
and then the cast back in they were make

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,590
a call by the sequences you're putting

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,660
in your applications and they were

00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:03,000
connecting Superboy's was two parties

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:05,610
together just so ably and simple now

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,490
this use case show an even more

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:11,850
complicated really cool in this year's

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:14,640
case a camera is registered to the cats

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,440
platform suit cast SDK and you can pull

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,750
a camera to monitor your family room

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,960
your living room or your bedroom if you

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:28,170
want to and then once the camera attack

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,470
emotion you make a call to your cell

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:34,020
phone and the your cell phone can answer

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,690
the call and the camille the videos from

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,150
your cell phone really cool and you can

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,560
watch you can monitor to your room what

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:45,300
happened in the bedroom you can monitor

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,130
that additionally you cell phone call

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,490
the cast API to actually come through

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,200
your cameras country or cameras Howie

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:55,140
the angles where you want to monitor

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,540
this is really cool by the way we have

00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,970
this real demo in our booth boost one

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,550
away so we are interesting I want to

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,890
learn about the cast and then I want to

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:07,160
see the demo please stop by booth one

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,160
away

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,940
another simple scenarios just to show

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,920
you how simple it is that you can

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,310
develop a communication enabled

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,310
application application doing test

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:25,040
develop and deploy and the same platform

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:33,560
within minutes the rainy days release is

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:36,680
simple with your API there so as a

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:40,010
summary and also conclude my speech I

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,780
want accuracy with open technology there

00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,510
are a lot of opportunities in the

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,680
telecom industry that we can innovate to

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:50,660
help our customer in the cloud-based

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,700
transformations and we are committed to

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:57,200
work with the community to build a

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:59,990
robust route to build a robust quality

00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,300
and the worst pest problem to help our

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:05,180
customer for them to innovate in these

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,090
areas you know after another day you

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,010
make it your customer happy right for

00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,680
that I thank you very much for your time

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:18,460
I hope you enjoy your risk of a summit
