00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,800
[Music]

00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:22,850
press okay so the top today is about

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,850
management

00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:37,829
how much people here after talking true

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,840
that's what they call the doctor gave me

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,899
another slide I love talker the

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,160
girlfriend Latia loves workers so you

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,870
know we're not gonna use it whatever

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:52,320
from science is using border so web

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,960
using content other people are using

00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:05,040
context is a categorize the guys are

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:08,270
using the world guys has been using but

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,159
you know doctor provides housing that no

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:15,409
contact technology provides and is the

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,850
social aspect about creating image so be

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,700
occurring events reusing as over path

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,799
for creating your the toka events

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,720
coalition that we mentioned about the

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:30,650
registry and then be able to share the

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,880
nature image of the workers okay so now

00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,770
you know I'm going to tell you at least

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,299
story greatest I'm gonna explain and

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,299
history you know it's about watch

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:50,130
yeah okay by the way that you know the

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,730
static one where the stock awareness

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,830
guys today they happen easier on you to

00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,600
disconnect rice here so you need to try

00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,430
it because you know it's it's a nice way

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,400
to go stop us here and they were going

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,980
to arrest you various ways to make it

00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,900
right okay so I'm going to tell our

00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:17,240
mystery about you know it's a little

00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:17,240
clam shell looking in the meantime you

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:44,550
know swinging and you know the rest of

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:48,080
the charges they get angry young man you

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:52,140
know after that so after several days

00:02:48,080 --> 00:03:00,840
the pig is what we call the doctor

00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:03,000
boss this is something that we are

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:08,430
following that the pivotal walk labs we

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,400
have last week so you know it's it's a

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,950
it's a way to make orchestrate docker

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,340
containers using an existing emerging

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,730
that is so what's what's beautiful about

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,410
that dr. Basra's so this is the V sub

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,390
creatures are created that we should

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,400
call dr. modulation so the first thing

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,030
is when they stop by and we not to start

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,170
now

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,170
just one at Jake

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:37,250
then you start needing more events maybe

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,280
two more containers and then a bunch of

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:45,080
containers and estate or containers

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,490
because of the containers because you

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,290
need to look at multiple who built from

00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,510
machines and the proper container some

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,490
people may change Agentry so we've been

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,310
talking person is you will be able to

00:03:52,490 --> 00:04:01,100
forget state several dollar containers

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:03,950
with several children which is the best

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,630
thing also about our boss is that when I

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,730
supposed to do very fast efficient

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,670
services so we support this field we

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,070
went to the misfit super addressed with

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,950
super rockin a stack we support clothes

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,830
that thanks to identity guys that we

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:23,030
contribute back with that CPI and we

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:25,010
super also move the confidently so you

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,390
know using the same tool to be able to

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,980
deploy you look at containers if you

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:37,120
want to the point to Google today

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:37,120
if you go back so using the same you

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,130
another thing that is really amazing

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,419
with you you have been today in the

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,940
lighting

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:48,350
taxes warning core mania has forget

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,530
about the forward most of higher

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,919
mobility across factory so the

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:59,090
respective and there are two below

00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,550
highly demanded methods our body so this

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,400
is talking

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:07,610
our days but this it means it will mean

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,770
that Bush is going to monitor your

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,630
containers for you if for some reason

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,820
one of the doctor containers slows down

00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:16,520
because the process exits because the

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,930
reason whatever docker is trying to

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,020
restart a container for you without

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,720
doing anything without trying to put any

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,280
kind of monitor system inside your

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,350
daughter container it's going to be

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:33,470
inside the container also we able to

00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:37,640
define the pregnancies between winter

00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,710
sometimes you know whatever application

00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,690
that you rely on that enemies if for

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,680
some reason that better has closed down

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,810
and the person is going to miss and

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:55,040
perhaps if you are revocation is not

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:59,810
well designed and their creations right

00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:02,180
so with the person industry between that

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,280
docker containers so if your application

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,160
of the tens of batteries and that is

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,170
post am much is going to restore the

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,470
defendant is going to mr. your

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,720
application master but you know

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,180
sometimes especially if you are doing

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,110
your veteran machines or supporting in

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:24,830
faster to so something can be done for

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:30,080
example a user accident we can kill one

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:32,210
lymphoma tears for example this can be

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,580
silent that beautiful machine is in the

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,370
hope that changing the maintain you

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,220
smoke and is going to kill European so

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,639
in that case this book is how is it's

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,350
gonna

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,410
but does it mean is going to speedy new

00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,690
year is going to inject a p.m. all of

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,370
your daughter containers it's going to

00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,040
start all of the docker containers and

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,260
if you have some kind of persistent disk

00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:01,419
attached to your people watch it is

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:04,590
going to read at your instantly the look

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:07,960
of arteries you will also be able to buy

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,240
physical host bones to your containers

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,560
with the seeking doesn't mean that if

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,090
for example if you were to play another

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,490
container the reason why is quality

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:21,910
means you can bind you talk about to the

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:25,120
butyl machine persistent is why is

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:28,660
useful because if for some reason you

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,250
know machine goes down and what is going

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,590
to resume the great another balloon

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,660
which it is going to attach your

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:38,010
persistent leaves so you are not going

00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,470
to lose that much is going to preserve

00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:44,500
that for you

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:46,539
also with Bosch you will be able to

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,720
recycle that you persistent least

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:53,229
without losing and we show you the

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,840
traditional demos commercial theaters

00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:58,510
and then like this you know future that

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,430
we have yet I think it was just good

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,070
thing is that with the bottom the talked

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:05,380
about release you will be gaining to get

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,050
all over the box or all of the

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:12,490
containers and to aggregate all of our

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:17,530
box when your emergency small investment

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:19,840
so far okay so now it's time for a demo

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,550
time I plan to do are we are the time I

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,960
have some green juices back up so let's

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,820
try everything and there are white

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,000
because it would do some great update

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:32,289
okay I will try to the Proxima so we

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,910
have to Jenkins you know easy as a usual

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:38,419
Allah this is understatement

00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:42,470
so if you want to pay with that don't

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,240
use that system or if you want a more

00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:50,120
aggressive system between dear friends

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:52,970
those your system okay okay so what we

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,060
are going to do so the first is that you

00:08:52,970 --> 00:09:02,090
know we are going to use the voice of my

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:03,380
manifest you know manifesting the common

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,750
things I will put in at the project

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:14,930
manifest we will see we will put the

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:16,730
producers so the number of C which is

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,560
the networking for that or for each

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,500
different machines we are going to use

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,230
you know kind of private network with

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,000
our productivity or you going to stand

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,980
and a static idea for watching and if

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,830
you ask to compete to one of our people

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,070
or machines etc and then we are going to

00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,690
say for each of the jobs each of the

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,100
beautiful message what are the

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,230
containers that we are going to put

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,970
inside a pyramid shapes the way that we

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,890
are going to do is using when we

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,800
complete job properties mental

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,680
properties as you can see we are going

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,410
to tell which is the name October

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,990
container which is the image that we

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:59,840
want to deploy right now it only

00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:01,940
supports the registry if for ruining

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,030
that container we need to set any

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:08,090
comment it would want to suppose any of

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:10,730
in general container reports to our bill

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,780
trauma team to a strawberry which if you

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,080
want to hide anymore

00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:18,770
for example whatever your attics so we

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,350
want to map and actually inside the

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,060
container with the persistent these it

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:28,310
is attached or

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:29,390
real property and also to specify and

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,810
there

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,820
but yeah sometimes it makes sense to use

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,350
one of the holding to talk very much but

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,440
sometimes it makes sense to put into a

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,550
beautiful image in there sorry you know

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,530
dr. image

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:48,230
so another option is to specify a low

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,330
profile inside your face this is an

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,120
example this example that we're going to

00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,520
later we are going to build and operate

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,220
much using elastic shirt and we're going

00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,160
to what is going to create that image

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:07,010
for us but it's going to the point and

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:09,860
it is the price so for this example I'm

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:16,130
going to use that little compute engine

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:17,240
so I'm going to logging into one of Jim

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,700
Knoxville for watching

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,860
when I have to provide everything so if

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,110
I type lots of studies you will see that

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,670
they have microbots that is deploy it

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:33,350
and Google compute engine rainin I have

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:35,450
if I type was resist and we see that

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,990
they have the doctor bursaries Oh voila

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:42,950
to my micro watch and then what we're

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:48,950
going to do is just any the deployment

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:52,160
manifest has everything has to the

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:55,340
director ideally it has the name of the

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,340
department I'm going to assign a static

00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,390
IP address it's a public IP address to

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,360
my deformity

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,700
so I can show you how ruining my yogurt

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,100
containers in a boom-boom

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:11,810
I can access from outside from a lack of

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:14,150
even access to opportunity and then

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,730
whatever you're going to do is we're

00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,950
going to the point three different jobs

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,600
to defragment containers so the first

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,200
thing that they're going to deploy it a

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,470
reddish container the second one will be

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,060
MySQL container and sell wear medium

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,760
elastic shares the first for the first

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,250
machines I'm going to use a you know

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:40,370
built a top argument for summer night

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:43,450
when you get that much on the fly okay

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,450
so where's the boy

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,750
and now watch the first thing that is

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,790
going to happen is gorgeous way to

00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:06,620
create a beautiful machine so I'm going

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:08,480
to Google developer console in a few

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:15,070
moments we will see the reason you hear

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:20,000
so much of the it's being created okay

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:22,100
Chris fear okay wait a second yeah okay

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,330
in the meantime where this is is beat

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:33,709
the coil I will go to the github repo

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:36,730
work the dr. Burton disease because one

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:40,279
of the see the things that are

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,990
highlighted in the really are all the

00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:45,890
properties that are supported in terms

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:50,209
of Carlos Ruiz right now the doctor part

00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:52,610
ways it's going to stop investing $1

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:54,500
your job that it was it has been wasted

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,110
I think that two days ago yesterday I

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,209
remember standing wet and here you can

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,220
see all of your terms that we can step

00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:03,740
for our containers so we can set the

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,540
name in the container payments the

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,010
docker file we want to build a locker

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,579
image on the fly

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:13,730
the common emergency point even when

00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:17,149
exposed to some holes in one to ask

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:19,820
anyone to or assistant is you want to

00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:23,829
set dependencies between between

00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:27,020
containers we can set using that

00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:29,899
property you Madison

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,560
remember stored up in containers you

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:36,020
want to restrict the number of CPU or

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:42,470
memory that we want recycle over the

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:45,649
container we can associate manifest so

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:50,060
let's go back to the to the board task

00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:52,880
so we have seen aspirated anemia and now

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,890
is contained in the joint but doesn't

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,570
mean a meet is that it's going to start

00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,810
the virtual machine is going to start

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:03,380
the dr. Damon is going to start the dr.

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:05,360
Damon that is going to fetch all the

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,910
elements that we have seven over the

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,610
manifest if we have a docker file is

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,339
going to be the treatment for the docker

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:20,529
file and then is going to start all

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:20,529
internal tables so let me show you

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:34,140
I went to pray which is that the yen

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:39,750
that he has been the project she's like

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:41,430
well I'm going to DC CH inside a

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,740
different machine so we can explain

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:52,950
what's going on well when appointment

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:57,600
has finished so if now hulusi that we

00:15:52,950 --> 00:16:01,290
have you know you have the operating the

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,810
DISA started and we have every of the

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,750
different docker containers and as I

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,010
still started right now is a day on the

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:14,240
process of facing the image from the

00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:14,240
movie industry anniversary

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,930
but the machine is to expose the poles

00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,170
to the you know to the physical health

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:46,050
and to the pooling IP address you need

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:48,150
to set let me go back this is an example

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:52,020
when we use the pine box

00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:54,330
these that we that we suppose in the

00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:57,779
terminal post an act inside a container

00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:00,420
to the physical floats so in that case

00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,370
in values we are going on arrays so we

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,930
are going to suppose the simplest six

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,520
three seven nine that is joining the

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,620
center container we're going to school

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,510
desk for to the six three six and nine

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,130
in the physical force it can be

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,350
different if you want but you know it's

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:28,260
just product like a sample is harder to

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:32,090
see so Bob on the vision so let's back

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,090
here and show you example

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:47,660
so what happens what is going to happen

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:50,210
is they're going to use an example if I

00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,880
have a MySQL service and I have a happy

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:56,800
future because if I said that the

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,480
relation depends on de- for service

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,280
definition the doctor particularly for

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,950
definition is not going to be started

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,220
until the medical services mental

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:10,400
disturbance say if for some reason the

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,860
MySQL container goes now the application

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,280
is going to be the house and he's going

00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,840
to it is not going to be respected uncle

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,440
the medical service is going to be

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,440
restarted again

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:28,160
now whether this means you know the

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,500
problem with means is that if you use

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,280
things is useful only when you start

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,560
containers but if for some reason you

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,480
know the master comes down you know

00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,790
nothing prevents that descriptor is that

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,680
universe started you know because the

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,150
leave the way that things work is just

00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,880
using and governments higher levels

00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,100
inside so the way that bars work is for

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,750
some reason the master comes up is going

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,910
to sweep down our school application and

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,910
any stock master and then the H

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:06,400
in this example of the same p.m. but

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,400
they can move around

00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:31,029
right you know I like to question and

00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:35,919
ask the community but super to go back

00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:37,690
with this kinda stuff you know cause we

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,470
asked a specific investor program

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:45,159
so right now you know we went to try to

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:47,590
find a mentor to set dependencies

00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:51,929
between containers that are on different

00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,929
views on which is doesn't mean yes

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,590
I would say that is quite different you

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,980
know itself you know nothing can get us

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,630
here there is right now if you are going

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,780
to use the doctor person ratio is is

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,610
more just in a services the notification

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,310
because if not we need to be replicated

00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,330
and you need to create you know whatever

00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,820
you need to run that application

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:33,120
designer can take our business vehicles

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,830
is not a happen yet for sure if this

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,780
application and your condition is up and

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,060
running and we will set up for you over

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,500
the fences in terms of economic it is

00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:46,560
some of the applications which are which

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,650
are ready to you know the job

00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,650
application

00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,419
right

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,950
you know because yesterday this must

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,440
remember Cynthia this is a fair approach

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,270
you talk so instead it's a nice feature

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:35,640
to you know think whenever I kind of

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:37,230
dependency suicidal contention yeah we

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,760
need that because it was really you see

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,970
with some when we fight these are forty

00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:49,020
much if we need to go that way the

00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:51,120
promotion within a battle right now so

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:59,160
I'm going to show you one of the

00:21:51,120 --> 00:22:01,500
features of killing Anna one of the very

00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,230
spontaneous and see that in really

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:08,480
whispers the containers going to kill

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,480
that ad

00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,380
and we are seeing that now radius is

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,140
missing from the different port so it

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,780
has been recycled alternatively by boys

00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:35,210
just just to make sure that we can

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:35,210
access to that then I'm going to use the

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:51,090
others so in this example we can

00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:54,240
occasionally do that we can access from

00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:56,100
my laptop to one of that containers as

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,580
it's ruining the side of one of the vent

00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,580
for my change

00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:20,730
okay so the next example is just going

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:23,150
to kill I mean if I go back here to see

00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,150
what beer

00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:32,360
there's BL 307 they go back here

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:35,120
I can't be over here Oh before that

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:43,910
before coming my birthday I'm going to

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:45,940
say change and now I'm ready to kill

00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,940
again

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,080
so what is happening what is going to

00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,620
happen right now is that boat useful to

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,560
detect that the PM is not using the rest

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:05,020
record that this building I bought is

00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,760
going to create an olivey for us as that

00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,550
being has the persistent basic attacks

00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:13,450
it is going to reattach the persistent

00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:15,820
least to the new PS and morning is going

00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:19,390
to restart different angles again and is

00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,570
going to attacks the same bottom to our

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:26,220
government and so we are going to

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,220
anything so if I go back here

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:39,399
in a few seconds we will see that there

00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,399
sweetie attached

00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,080
it's kind of fix

00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:58,899
so haha voice has a depth is that the

00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:01,090
reason missing here is not written India

00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:02,889
is going to deploy all of the jobs

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,399
integrity in Marion for us

00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:09,759
they came here Italy I will see that the

00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:12,940
reason humans emboss is the price

00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:18,779
everything inside of me I'm going to
