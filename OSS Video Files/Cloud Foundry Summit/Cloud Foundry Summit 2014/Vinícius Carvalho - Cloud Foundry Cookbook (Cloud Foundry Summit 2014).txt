Cloud Foundry Cookbook: Recipes for a Successful Cloud Foundry Deployment in Production

Cloud Foundry provides the foundation for your PaaS infrastructure. It streamlines deployment and turns your developers and your ops into super heroes when it comes to time to market. But what about your architecture? How should you build your services (or microservices)? How can you guarantee security is being enforced on every layer of your architecture? How can you solve cross-service dependencies? How can services discover each other? How could developers leverage an API explorer to test your services and build apps on top of it? How could you leverage a data pipeline to solve polyglot persistence and cascading operations on diverse persistence technologies? How can you monetize on top of your public services? How could you use a service registry to boost your models with extended metadata?

This session presents a few recipes to demonstrate how to solve some of the problems found when applying cloud patterns to real business scenarios.
