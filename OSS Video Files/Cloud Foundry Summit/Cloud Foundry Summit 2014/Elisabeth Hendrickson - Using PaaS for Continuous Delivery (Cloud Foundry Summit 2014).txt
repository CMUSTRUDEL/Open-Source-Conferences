Title: Elisabeth Hendrickson - Using PaaS for Continuous Delivery (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-30
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Technical track breakout session presented by Elisabeth Hendrickson, Pivotal.

With continuous delivery, you release frequently and with very little, or no, manual intervention. That requires three things: fully automated tests; a continuous integration server that executes those tests and can promote successful deployments; and an automated deployment mechanism with zero downtime. PaaS's are a perfect fit for this. Cloud Foundry makes zero-downtime automated deployments straightforward. Further, cloud-based CI services such as Cloudbees work well with Cloud Foundry. In this talk, Elisabeth explains how to achieve continuous delivery with Cloud Foundry using one of our own applications (docs.cloudfoundry.org) as an example.
