On the Origin of Services by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Features in the Struggle for Life: The Business Benefits of Microservices with Cloud Foundry

In this talk Russ Miles, Chief Scientist at Simplicity Itself, will share his experiences of the business benefits of building software that can evolve as fast as your business needs it to on top of the Cloud Foundry PaaS.

Taking advantage of Cloud Foundry's simple usage and underlying robustness, Russ will explore the different design and implementation approaches that a microservice-based approach brings to the table and how the features of Cloud Foundry support what is important to the usage of microservices, including taking a practical tour from a monolithic application to a microservice-based application.

In conclusion Russ will share the big benefits that microservices enable and how Cloud Foundry currently and in the future might evolve to provide even better support for this approach.
