Title: VMware - Hybrid Clouds and Cloud Foundry (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-03
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Modern business is putting Enterprise IT under tremendous pressure to achieve cost savings and significantly greater agility while retaining good governance practices. Adoption of public cloud is a common approach to addressing at least some of these challenges. However, a number of forces are driving most established organizations to use both private and public cloud infrastructure simultaneously -- so-called Hybrid Clouds. This presentation will discuss how Cloud Foundry can be used to simplify the transition to Hybrid Cloud and facilitate the management of applications to achieve both agility and governance in these environments.

Killian Murphy, Senior Director of Product Management, Cloud Foundry at VMware.

00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:13,590
Hey

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,330
so yes as we was saying I've been in

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,279
clad family for just a little over four

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,779
years now we've rewritten a whole bunch

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,160
of components during that time where I

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,830
counted recently we're on our fifth

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,180
cloud controller by my count I can tell

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,800
you that none of those rewrites had a

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,539
presentation anything like on seize

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,310
earlier today so that was the most

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,810
awesome presentation if if Diego is

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,210
anything like as good as his present

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:38,219
it's just gonna be wild man I love it so

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,390
that was great work so and you know and

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,739
suggestions for making the conference

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,930
better if you could just put on C last

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,610
at all conferences from here on that

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,890
would make my life easier for sure so

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,989
these guys before me the the Bank of New

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,329
York I set set me up pretty nicely I'm

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,219
gonna talk about hybrid clouds on Cloud

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,370
Foundry at work we've been doing at

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,690
VMware for a little while I'm gonna show

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,430
you a little bit of this stuff lie this

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,019
so if someone would sacrifice a chicken

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,700
to the demo gods for me I'd really

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,979
appreciate it we'll see if things

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,960
actually work so I just wanted to UM

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,850
talk a little bit about what's happening

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,740
with enterprise IT and kind of set a

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,330
little bit of context first so you know

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,299
obviously we're seeing huge demands for

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,549
agility right there's various unfriendly

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,619
players disrupting industries in all

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,390
kinds of different places right I stuck

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,979
a few up on the screen here but there's

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,900
one in basically every vertical and

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,729
probably more right and so we're seeing

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,159
this demand for agility but at the same

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,509
time we also see the need to retain you

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,670
know what I'm broadly calling government

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,909
governance right so we've seen issues

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,009
around security with with target we saw

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,710
the best marketed exploit of all time

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,750
heartbleed even has a logo so pretty

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,850
awesome but we also see things like

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,509
regulatory issues right there's the

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,149
FCC's logo and also financial control

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,710
right the the bean counters always want

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,570
to make sure they're in charge so we see

00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,369
this tension a lot in enterprise IT in

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,490
particular attention between demands for

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,259
agility and for retaining governance at

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,969
the same time and that's a tension that

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,310
we see across the board not just in pass

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,660
but with many many different areas of

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,670
technology and so um VMware

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,990
it has been you know obviously dealing

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,360
with this and our customer base for some

00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,920
time we started advertising compute and

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,770
we now also virtualized storage and

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,180
networks and so and and that's basically

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,310
trying to make the core infrastructure

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,050
as agile as possible and then applying

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,730
that in a number of different context

00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,130
right so applying that I'm using that

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,930
technology in in private clouds and

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,580
people's own data centers in public

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,630
clouds we have various partners and in

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,490
fact we're also running our own

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,700
infrastructure as a service near the V

00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,410
cloud hybrid service so we put on top of

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,180
those a set of management tools and

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,950
those tools the idea of the hybrid cloud

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,920
is that you can use the same tools

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,360
whether in your own premises or or in

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,250
the public cloud and that's essentially

00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,960
work what the major value proposition of

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,400
hybrid cloud is right the major value

00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,230
proposition use the same things in

00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,030
different places and of course we want

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,250
to make this applicable to multiple

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,880
different types of applications right so

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,960
you've probably heard of the

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,370
software-defined data center that's

00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,660
essentially what we're talking about

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,510
when we talk about this

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,890
so we've so the question is what's the

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,050
role of cloud foundry in all of this

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,430
well basically for us we want to make

00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,170
sure the cloud foundry is available in

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,730
all these different places - right and

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,900
so we've worked with pivotal for the

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,910
last year I talked about it at the

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,180
platform conference at this time last

00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:26,300
year to bring pivotal CF to vSphere and

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,120
to V cloud and so I'm I'm just going to

00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,250
show you this is a deployment of pivotal

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,050
CF on the unretired hybrid services what

00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,810
it looks like broadly so we deploy it

00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,760
into a private network expose it through

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,040
a couple of public IPs and so on and so

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,590
I'm just gonna show you that it's real

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,560
we GA this product about three weeks ago

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:48,440
and so obviously VMware and pivotal

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,850
worked together so this is pivotal CF

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,800
ops manager so this is what an

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,720
administrator who's deploying Cloud

00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,310
Foundry would see and so if they were

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,770
doing it on V CHS they click on this

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,970
tile and and then configure various

00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,650
things in here so this is for example

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,080
configuring the interest

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:06,140
infrastructure-as-a-service API URL and

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,180
credentials and so on to login and so

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,910
then and then you go ahead and deploy

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,770
deploy Cloud Foundry deploy the elastic

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,690
runtime as it's called in here and so I

00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,730
went ahead and just clicked in here and

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,560
and picked up the status it takes a

00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,150
little while to pick up the status but

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,160
these are all the deployed VMs in this

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:24,100
particular deployment of pivotal CF

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,590
right of the elastic runtime

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,080
so that's just a very quick example and

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,930
now the end user the developer who's

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,460
using pivotal CF c--'s and in a console

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,310
like this a developer console like this

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,760
so this is this user this developer is

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:45,850
and let me make that go away this

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:47,560
developer is is in the CF summit org and

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,130
there's a couple of spaces and different

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,560
things like that

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,150
and so you know I've deployed a couple

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,570
of applications in there okay

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,640
so so just to show you that it's real

00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:01,690
that was pivotal CF running on the V

00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,280
cloud hybrid service now so what are we

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,450
trying to do when we when we build these

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,040
hybrid clouds what are the use cases

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,200
we're focusing on what are the things

00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,520
that we want to do well here's a whole

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,470
bunch right and I'm not going to belabor

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,730
the point here there's a whole bunch of

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,250
different kinds of things we want to be

00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,320
able to do we want to be able to deploy

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,150
applications in public clouds or on-prem

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,920
depending on if dev test or production

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,900
regulatory controls different things

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,000
like that want to be able to use it for

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,950
dr we want to be able to for example

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,780
deploy the classic hybrid workload which

00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,280
is mobile apps right part of it sitting

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,300
in the public cloud and part of the data

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,300
