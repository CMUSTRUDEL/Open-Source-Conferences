Publication date: 2014-07-03
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Modern business is putting Enterprise IT under tremendous pressure to achieve cost savings and significantly greater agility while retaining good governance practices. Adoption of public cloud is a common approach to addressing at least some of these challenges. However, a number of forces are driving most established organizations to use both private and public cloud infrastructure simultaneously -- so-called Hybrid Clouds. This presentation will discuss how Cloud Foundry can be used to simplify the transition to Hybrid Cloud and facilitate the management of applications to achieve both agility and governance in these environments.

Killian Murphy, Senior Director of Product Management, Cloud Foundry at VMware.
