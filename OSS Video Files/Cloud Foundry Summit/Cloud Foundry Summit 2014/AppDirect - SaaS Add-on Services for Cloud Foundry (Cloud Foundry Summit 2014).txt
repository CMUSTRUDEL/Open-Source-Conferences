	Paul Arnautoff, Director of Business Development, AppDirect

Two years ago, Pivotal Cloud Foundry partnered with AppDirect to launch a Services Marketplace to make it easier for Developers to find, buy and use the tools they need to build cloud software. With the recent development of Pivotal's V2 Service Broker, the AppDirect services catalog is now available through not only Pivotal Web Services, but also any private or public deployment of Cloud Foundry anywhere. In this discussion, Paul Arnautoff will highlight how AppDirect integrated with the CF Service Broker and is extending the consumption of 3rd party services across a growing network of PaaS marketplaces as well as how ISVs can integrate once with the services catalog to distribute through any Cloud Foundry deployment.
