We will introduce our Cloud Foundry Integration project to accelerate DevOps. We all know that the DevOps approach brings developers and operators into closer collaboration, but the requirements of each team member are different. In order to tie these various requirements together, we package the entire agile development process as "DevOps+" including issue management, software design, code implementation, quality testing, systems deployment, security check, release management and its operation in the cloud. This session will provide a demo of "DevOps+" with the integration of Cloud Foundry.
