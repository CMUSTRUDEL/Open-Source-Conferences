00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:12,990
hi everyone I'm mark croff I work at

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,089
pivotal as a product manager for the

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,330
Cloud Foundry runtime funtime team and

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,430
today we'll be talking about pivotal web

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,570
services we call it P dubs or pee wees

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,090
it's our online public cloud and I've

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,619
got mine as ignite style format for the

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,880
slide so you're gonna see them flying by

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,460
and I'll hopefully delivery to your

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,829
lunch on time first off we're open for

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,469
business 3 cents a gigabyte hour you can

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,030
host any app on any of the platforms we

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,000
support running at run Pelayo

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,680
last year we have seen an 8x increase in

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,239
the size of an app you can push and

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,090
upload to run pivotal i/o we're now

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,520
supporting up to a gigabyte of data you

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,350
can push up in your app to run 35

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,390
successful proud to play mminton

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,879
in the last 9 months since we last

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,120
talked to you and to do that we've gone

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,699
through our pipeline of commits from the

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,799
community from inside of pivotal as well

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,180
as change to support the rest of the

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,010
products in cloud foundry has gone

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,330
through and been delivered 35 times of

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,299
that we've had 29,000 609 users perform

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,770
over 700,000 app pushes you'll see all

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,299
of my numbers are not rounded because I

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,130
think if we're truthful we better get

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,170
the real data this is about 6 hours old

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,909
so you have to forgive me

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,380
console has been redesigned I think it

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,090
looks amazing

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,280
please check it out at run pivotal I owe

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,920
you now have an org dashboard you can

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,479
see all the apps and stats of your org

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,100
in addition to that we now have two new

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,829
build packs that are supported running

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,770
in prod one of which is the golang build

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,920
pack which is pretty cool and recently

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,299
partnering with IBM we've got the

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,579
Liberty for Java build pack up and

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,500
running in prod in the very near future

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,869
the team is actually working on I've

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,909
seen it work we have a PHP build pack

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,020
and a Python bil pack that should be

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:03,299
ready to fly here very soon and we have

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,610
11 new services launched just in the

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:10,080
last 9 months it's active in our

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,700
marketplace you can see a bunch there in

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,760
the last 9 months we've learned a lot of

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,760
lessons

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,239
sometimes more than one AWS ez goes down

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,790
at a time and this is what it looks like

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,370
we've learned to add robustness to Cloud

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,709
Foundry we've now removed all the spots

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,010
in Cloud Foundry we have many layers of

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:31,810
availability yes that is one and a half

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,900
billion server log lines are produced

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,510
every two weeks in PWS and it consumes

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,310
over a terabyte of disk this is a lot of

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,290
data but this is the data we go through

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,690
to assure that we're catching everything

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,040
that's going on in the platform and

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,829
we've also learned that some Bitcoin

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,470
miners find point zero zero three cents

00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:52,150
per month per app instance worth it to

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,140
mine on Cloud Foundry has taught us a

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,720
lot about how to do better isolation and

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,160
demarcation of different instances some

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,390
things that we're bringing soon to pee

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:07,120
tubs is Ubuntu trusty 1404 support with

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,829
the new stem cells and new root FS we're

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,840
really excited about getting Cloud

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:13,060
Foundry the first time in many years to

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,269
a modern operating system so that's

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,470
coming soon as well as the Daigo project

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:19,239
I'm sure a lot of you have heard about

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,750
what we're doing they're rewriting the

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,980
DEA and go as well as re-engineering and

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,989
architecting how we do application

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:31,090
execution so that's coming up very soon

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,650
in addition to that we have net

00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,200
application support we're partnering

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:38,019
with our friends at CenturyLink and

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,079
we're really excited to get real net

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,959
support in Cloud Foundry and bring that

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:46,019
to run pebble io at some point as well

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,980
it was brought up in some prior

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,810
presentations but we're going to have

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,919
support for docker so you can push

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:57,700
docker files and have them back by

00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,010
docker also coming soon as out of

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,379
scaling this is really fun you'll be

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,750
able to purchase just enough capacity

00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:06,480
and let your app Auto scale as more

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,970
scale is needed for your app

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,730
additionally we have a new console space

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,129
dashboard a new app dashboard and many

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,900
other new features in the console is

00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,070
coming in a complete redesign coming

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,190
soon to run pebble IO

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,539
and that was my lightning talk thank you

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,790
