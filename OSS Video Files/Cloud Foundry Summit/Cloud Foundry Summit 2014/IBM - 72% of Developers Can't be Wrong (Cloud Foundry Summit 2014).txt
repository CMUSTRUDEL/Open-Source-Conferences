Description: 
	Keynote presented by Bala Rajaraman, IBM Distinguished Engineer and CTO for Cloud Platform Services and Angel Diaz, IBM VP Open Technologies & Cloud Performance.

Cloud is here - but are your developers? 72% of developers report already using cloud-based services or APIs as part of the applications that they are building, 85% of new software is being built for cloud and by 2016, 25% of all the world's applications will be in the cloud. These are some really big shifts that are relevant to nearly any organization whether your team started day 1 with cloud-based applications and services or if they're brand new to the game.

In this keynote, Bala Rajaraman, IBM Distinguished Engineer and CTO for Cloud Platform Services and Angel Diaz, IBM VP Open Technologies & Cloud Performance discuss how Cloud Foundry Summit has a lot to offer for developers of all stripes, making it THE open source PaaS project for the industry. They will discuss the role of Cloud Foundry in an open cloud architecture and let's face it, if your business is not building on open technologies, you're building a dead end Cloud.
