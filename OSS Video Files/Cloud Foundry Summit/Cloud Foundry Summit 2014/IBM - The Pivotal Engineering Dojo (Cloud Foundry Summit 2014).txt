00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:15,640
I'm Max and this is my colleague Jules

00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,480
he actually was supposed to be initially

00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,310
and on all of the advertisement and

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,440
unfortunately it wasn't so we'll make up

00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,600
for it just really English sorry yeah I

00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,760
don't like to claim credit let me think

00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,330
he deserve as much credit as me the

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,589
other thing also is Jules just submitted

00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:37,600
his PhD so he's gonna be a doctor so I'm

00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:40,210
jinx it that is the worst thing that you

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,039
can cite as we'll do fine we'll be

00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,679
pairing on this talk so the talk today

00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,839
is about the dojo experience at pivotal

00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,699
so we're gonna pair on this and we're

00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:50,979
gonna cover what I think will be an

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:52,659
informative talk and I also will try to

00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,579
make sure we get a little bit of time

00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:57,280
towards the end so you can ask some

00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:58,959
questions so let's get started so the

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,879
first thing is of course a dojo what is

00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:03,429
the dojo it's like if you've if you've

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,740
done any karate or any martial arts it's

00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:08,980
really the space where you go and you

00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,190
learn with masters so think of it as

00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:15,220
entering this stage right and if you are

00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:17,920
fans of the matrix like we are you can

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,620
kind of think of the first couple Matrix

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,730
movies and it feels somewhat like this

00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:25,720
so that's the theme we're going to use

00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:27,280
so how do you contribute to Cloud

00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,530
Foundry if you ask yourself this

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,390
question and you want to be more than

00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,030
just a contributor that submits a small

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,430
PR you want to have significant impact

00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,860
how do you do this and how does your

00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,260
company do it well that's what the dojo

00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,900
program is for of course you know people

00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,820
from pivotal our colleagues there would

00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,210
be the best people to talk about what

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,120
they think the dojo program is we were

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,280
going to give you our experience our

00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,490
perspective from that dojo since we both

00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,409
went to it okay and as part of doing

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,990
this what we're gonna do is to also give

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,120
you an idea of what does it mean to be

00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,760
agile especially since we are both from

00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,450
IBM and we have a perspective of agility

00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,969
from a bigger company and then we'll end

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,489
up with some thoughts so with this I'm

00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:20,019
going to pass it to Julian who's gonna

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:22,950
take you to the next stage okay slightly

00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:25,209
let's see I'm so I'm gonna try and go

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,999
super fast because I think would be good

00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:32,560
if you have questions at the end so if I

00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:35,499
skip important stuff write it down and

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,959
apologies in advance for the speed so I

00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:39,819
just want to set the scene first and and

00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,609
just sort of talk in general terms and

00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:45,959
then we'll talk about more specifics

00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:49,719
after that so does anyone remember

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,359
extreme programming and agile and what

00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:55,930
people thought when all of this started

00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:57,700
so if you remember the I guess like 10

00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,469
years or so ago extreme programming

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,749
there was a lot of hoopla and

00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:03,340
controversy is this going to work is

00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:06,579
this a realistic way of building

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,139
software can be really pair program all

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:11,549
the time is test first of adament going

00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:13,599
to work do we can we really get rid of

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,700
architecture and documentation all of

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,569
these things

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,469
and you know that became agile scrum or

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,700
all these other ways of building

00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:26,409
software I think the real thing is it

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,079
does work like this is this is something

00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:32,980
that works and extreme programming is

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:38,139
one side of that agile is another

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:39,309
there's more than one way to build a

00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,349
project but we ought they all have the

00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:43,689
same goals we want to maintain quality

00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:46,150
and build software fast and respond to

00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:48,849
change I'm going to talk a little bit

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,549
about the differences because I suspect

00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:54,340
that a lot of people will have more

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:58,180
experience with the more big company

00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,849
agile that may be places like IBM or I

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,859
work use of this style of agile and on

00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,849
the dojo the style of agile you see is

00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:10,150
quite different it's you know it's it's

00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:15,370
a much more extreme programming original

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:17,860
form of agile and so I want to maybe

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,989
highlight some of those differences but

00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,300
keeping in mind I think these are both

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,940
things that do actually work quite well

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,390
in their own

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,460
contacts I will also say that this is

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,820
very much my observations and it might

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,440
well not be by the book how things are

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:39,240
supposed to work but this this felt like

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:45,510
the differences to us so big company

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:47,100
agile versus pivotal agile how many are

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,890
of interest like how many people in the

00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,890
room sort of use agile would describe

00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:56,790
themselves as using agile and their

00:04:51,890 --> 00:05:00,300
projects it seems like about half and if

00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:02,550
you use agile by a show of hands if you

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,610
use sort of extreme programming style

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,130
agile if you know or more sort of scrum

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:13,860
style or more of the new more big

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:16,530
company agile processes so I think so

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,160
who uses pair programming in the room

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:23,850
like the people pair a lot like some but

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,220
not not a lot so I think I think it's

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:31,200
fair to say that single coding is kind

00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,610
of the default at the moment if if

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,400
someone doesn't tell you they're

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,080
probably a single coder and the it works

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,030
okay but there's a lot of problems with

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,550
single coding right takes you a long

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,740
time to come up to speed on a new

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,320
project is sometimes difficult to get

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,090
knowledge sharing among the team and I

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,860
think one thing you notice is it takes a

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,740
long time to go from being a junior

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,220
programmer to a Senior Programmer on a

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,510
team pair programming is a pretty

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,030
different model you probably all know

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:03,000
about it in practice it is a very

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,480
intense way of coding I would find that

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,590
by the end of Friday of a week I needed

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,570
my weekend immediately I had to sleep

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,540
better than I normally sleep on the

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,910
weekends but it's a fantastic way to

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:24,540
learn I think you you get to work with

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:25,919
lots of smart people each day and it's

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,000
very rewarding you feel like you've

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,190
achieved something at the end of each

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,610
day it's a very intense and rewarding

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,610
thing to do

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,880
but it is probably not for everyone I

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,190
think I really enjoyed it I think a lot

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,440
of people will really enjoy it but

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,470
equally I don't know that it's something

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,770
that everyone would enjoy his way of

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,970
coding and I certainly don't think it's

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,310
the way I always want to write code

00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:55,870
there's a there are times when you when

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:58,440
you might not want to I wonder if people

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:01,750
recognize this this is the sort of the

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,940
agile style methodology that's not

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,380
really agile at all right it's where you

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,930
do the exact same thing that you

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,690
normally do but you call it agile and

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,150
say the old things still there but we

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:17,200
call them sprints I think this is

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:19,360
somewhat common I think test first is

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,100
getting adopted but not completely and

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,080
what you have to understand I think is

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,600
that the the pivotal style is really

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:31,180
fully agile everything is test first

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,060
everything is pair programs that's

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,320
awesome and that works really well the

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,210
flip side of that is sometimes there's

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,150
some limited amounts of documentation

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,560
because you don't need it as much when

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,320
everyone's in the same room and everyone

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,630
is pairing and there's this there's a

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,130
lot of issues where there's a reliance

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,760
for being in the same room and it works

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:53,500
great but it might not work for larger

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,800
contexts and that's something we might

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,840
come back to comment on a bit later so

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,480
that's the sort of high level of the

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,220
differences between the two and now we

00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,300
will talk a little bit about the

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:10,690
specifics sure Thank You Jules so if

00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,700
after what Jules mentioned in terms of

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,580
like differentiating between what you

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,860
see at your company and what you hear

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,810
from pivotal you feel a little bit like

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,690
you know reuse in the matrix like this

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,090
that's exactly how you should feel but

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,640
in reality what you're gonna see is that

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,220
it's actually a great way to learn after

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,570
a few weeks you get into it ok so what

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,030
we're gonna do now is to kind of give

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,190
you an idea of our experiences and there

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,229
are some people here I can see like matt

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,570
from director Foreman pivotal so

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,490
hopefully you know we can make sure that

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,169
we address you know the things that we

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,800
learn and if you have more question you

00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,769
can come to

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,440
and talk to him as well so our

00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:52,240
experience was mostly and and the first

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,029
thing I should say is that the dojo

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,649
program at pivotal is by invitation

00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:59,290
so pretty much we got to get an

00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:02,380
invitation format or I guess what me or

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,390
David Stevenson but it's you shouldn't

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,010
be discouraged from talking to them and

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,600
seeing if you can get an invitation but

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,880
it's not by invitation once you get an

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,910
invitation it's usually six to eight

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,890
weeks and you work directly with the

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,399
team at pivotal in San Francisco not too

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,990
far from here the other thing I tried to

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,640
do specifically is to try to work with

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,000
multiple team but typically you would

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,230
work with one team to just get a good

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,320
overview of what that team does and

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:34,510
generally as Jules mentioned it's an

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,420
opportunity an opportunity to learn I

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,519
came in personally and Cloud Foundry

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,950
having a lot of experience in software

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,260
engineering agile and so on but not a

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,029
lot in Cloud Foundry per se so what I

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,550
wanted to do is to learn the code base

00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:50,200
make sure I knew how to debug because of

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,600
course that's the first thing you want

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,279
to do and be able to set up a system and

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,399
so on and then of course contribute

00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,910
because as you'll hear from anybody at

00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,290
pivotal once they put you in I mean

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,060
you're part of the team you know you're

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,670
gonna be contributing immediately and

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,990
you want to hold your own because your

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,910
reputation is on the line and you're

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,800
your company's reputation so you're

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,160
trying to gain credibility right that's

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,430
the goal and overall I would say it was

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,709
very positive so I will not just be here

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,320
saying this is perfect there is gonna be

00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:25,329
some place where I'll point out things

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,660
that could be improved or at least my

00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:31,959
opinion on those things but overall it's

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:34,510
overwhelmingly positive so just to give

00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:36,250
you an idea of what happens they are

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,410
pivotal I mean you know they are very

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,949
open culture so you can actually go in

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:44,949
and and sort of do a visit but generally

00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:47,290
they have this big room where everybody

00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:50,820
and Cloud Foundry gets together and this

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:54,579
is the stand up and typically it's Matt

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,410
David or James who run it and they kind

00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:58,120
of get an idea of what's what you know

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,760
is there anybody that wanna

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,980
or something is there talk just today

00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,450
what's gonna happen during the day so

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,660
basically an opportunity for everybody

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:11,170
to get to get a chance to talk you know

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,450
and and sort of lay it out to everybody

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:16,930
else then after that you kind of go to

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:19,990
your own team and you kind of do the

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,630
same but this time specifically in a

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,320
board and a smaller setting just with

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:28,180
that team and just also with the members

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,650
of the team that you know essentially

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,390
care for a particular part of the

00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,460
product so for instance I work with the

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,470
Bosh team so I would go to the stand up

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,850
of the Bosh team and then if you work

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,850
with the runtime team you do the same

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,310
and so on that's also after the stand up

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,920
where people pair so the decision on

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,960
pairing happens by the team so typically

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,730
the product managers or the directors if

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,220
they are in the womb they actually leave

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,960
and the team decide on pairing so

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,390
there's always some kind of an anchor

00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,360
for the team so sort of a team lead he

00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,850
or she helps coordinate the pairing but

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,920
that happens by the team and then of

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,830
course you go and you go start pairing

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:09,250
so an example this is a picture of Rob

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,720
and Dmitri pairing they're part of the

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,940
Bosh team but that's typically what

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,730
happened you can see it's two computers

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:21,250
with two keyboards a to monitor sorry

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:23,380
but one actual computer so there's one

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,930
piece of code that's being written in

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:29,980
and worked on by two people at the same

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:33,070
time and as Jews mentioned you will find

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,450
it to be very weird if you've never done

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,150
this before but it's something you can

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,190
learn very quickly and it's extremely

00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,260
effective and it's also very taxing

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,630
because you are have to constantly

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,029
communicate constantly share ideas and

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,730
you have to have some level of respect

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,980
for your point for your pair because it

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,480
doesn't work if you don't and it doesn't

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,550
work if you just want to take over the

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,560
keyboard it also doesn't work if you

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,240
just want to sit down and let the other

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,670
person take over the keyboard so it's a

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,870
it's a constant communication constant

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,910
feedback you learn from everybody I've

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,709
paired with I can't see everybody are

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,830
pivotal but a lot of people are pivotal

00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,660
and every single person I've paired with

00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:15,480
I've learned something within a few

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,670
hours so it's a very very effective

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,720
fashion it's just different so you need

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:24,170
to learn it so when I did work with the

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,089
runtime team you know it's a very

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,820
important team generally it was very

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:32,690
chaotic to some extent because there's a

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,089
lot happening so it may not be the best

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,829
first place to go depending on what your

00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,480
intent is but if you want to learn the

00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:41,190
internal of Cloud Foundry the kernel

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,380
that's where you go and this is where

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,450
people like Matt and David can help you

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,420
after you get an invitation because they

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,310
can kind of help you realize where you

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,950
would better fit and they'll help you

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,300
make that decision it's also not the

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,880
best place to go if you want to learn

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,920
about how to use calendar because you're

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,829
essentially working on the kernel versus

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,560
on applying the Cloud Foundry kernel to

00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:06,720
do something for you the next time I

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,300
worked on it was a Bosch team and

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,040
they're under less pressure but it's as

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,019
important because it's essentially the

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,670
foundation on how to set up Cloud

00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,980
Foundry so a lot of people may find this

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,260
to be very interesting to go to because

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,700
if your goal is to set up that boundary

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,910
for your company that may be a good

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:27,300
place there's a lot to be done and it's

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:30,329
journey has kind of its own language I

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:33,300
find you know learning Bosch is also

00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:36,180
about learning sort of how the Bosch

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,700
team represents different parts of the

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,709
Bosch environment and and using Bosch to

00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,140
deploy cloud foundry and other things so

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,089
this is certainly you'll get an

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,860
appreciation if you don't understand

00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,200
boss right now or you don't appreciate

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,060
it this is a good place what you could

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,310
talk to dr. Nick and he'll convince you

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,550
but this is also a very good way to

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,520
learn Bosch okay so the other thing that

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,380
happened is that we did get a chance to

00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,449
to talk to at least in my case I've

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:07,529
tried to pair with other with other

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:11,160
folks I certainly give feedback to the

00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:13,260
directors and and also rob me and what

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,600
you find is that it's it's very open

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,890
it's it's a feedback welcoming culture

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,710
so they're always trying to adjust and

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,110
it's a great place to essentially go and

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,840
and and and embed yourself and learn so

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,900
the final parts is to kind of loop back

00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:33,380
so you know looking back I still work

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,420
there half my I have my week pretty much

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,190
and sometimes I embed myself to go do

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,200
something with them but generally

00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,810
looking back there are some things that

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,880
we can think through and say okay what

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,990
worked very very well and what maybe

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:50,990
could be improved so first thing is

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:54,550
positively I mean I have not worked for

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:57,260
any groups inside big company like IBM

00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:02,390
that I thought was as nice as pivotal I

00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:06,350
think there is a I don't know if the

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:08,030
directors or Bob me say that oh you need

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,440
to be nice if you are in an

00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,910
you're gonna get out of here I don't

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,660
know if they do that they've never told

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:16,610
me but that's basically what I see right

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,370
everybody there is extremely nice very

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,110
welcoming you can go talk to anybody

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,350
I've not had one person I try to talk to

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:26,450
that refused me and not IBM have years

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,360
of years of experience I can point to a

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:31,480
few of those so you know different

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,630
culture but that's that's what it is

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,460
clearly there is a very strike mismatch

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:41,600
there are people at IBM like Rachel

00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,370
who's trying to change this to make IBM

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,780
a little bit closer to pivotal I don't

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,970
know if it's your case in your company

00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,750
but I think you can learn a lot from

00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,920
them you know so and I guess any small

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,180
company if you're coming from a big

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,650
company if you're a small company maybe

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,140
you will see that they're a bit too big

00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,480
for you but generally I thought there's

00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:03,380
a biz match and we're trying to fix that

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:06,080
a very important thing is that decisions

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,090
are made very very quickly so you want

00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,370
to talk to James beer he's usually there

00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:14,000
he's meeting with customers all the time

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:15,980
but I've always had a chance but I

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,360
wanted to talk to him to basically see

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,710
him in the hallway and say hey James can

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,870
I talk to you about something oh Mack

00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,790
same thing and they've usually if they

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,360
can't talk to me right now they'll talk

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,460
to you later

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,740
and when you're pairing if you need to

00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,720
make a decision you basically do the

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,639
same and that's how decisions are made

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,600
very very quickly on the fly so that's

00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:38,399
that's extremely important as Jews

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,980
mentioned and weird well in this they

00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:43,799
just do agile with a very high level of

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,590
discipline so if you want to learn this

00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:48,299
this is a great place to do it there are

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,340
entire floor second floor is pretty much

00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:52,379
cf so when you go there it's pretty open

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,029
most of the things happening there are

00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:55,980
not closed door there are a few things

00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:59,610
but generally it's open you can discuss

00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:02,669
with anybody and you know pretty much

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,440
for us to be able to contribute as much

00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:06,120
as we've done to Cloud Foundry and

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,519
continue doing this and even accelerate

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,100
it it's gonna require this embedding and

00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,539
I think generally people are happy how

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,669
do you scale it that's a problem but

00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:18,860
generally it's the way to do it so I

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:18,860
would encourage you to consider the same

00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:23,039
they don't really have scheduled because

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,149
you go by the backlog like James was

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:29,700
talking about before today but in some

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:31,169
ways it's all out there in the open so

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,000
this is kind of how it works

00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:35,429
whereas you contrast this with big

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,470
companies where they usually have a set

00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:39,000
goal and set date where they want things

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,740
to be done so these are the positive

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,529
things so what are they're not so

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,659
positive things I hope I don't offend

00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:47,820
anybody but I'll lay it out there so

00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:49,740
first thing is I think there's a lack of

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,519
slack and they're trying to fix this

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,279
with things like having a little bit of

00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,850
hackathon to allow people to kind of

00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,620
explore things but I find that unlike at

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,779
IBM where I could create my own slack

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,580
there's not all of slack there because

00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:08,970
everything is in the backlog you just

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,799
work on them one after the other the

00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,139
decisions are fast but they are not

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,570
data-driven at least as far as I could

00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:18,299
see maybe it's changing maybe Matt and

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,879
the rest have lots of data that they

00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:24,169
cook and they think they decide on I

00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:26,909
don't know but at least I don't see it

00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:29,370
is it important to be data-driven

00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:31,320
probably to some extent not so much at

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,029
this point but as things get bigger it

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,889
might be interesting to have more data

00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:37,889
and I know James mentioned before that

00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:40,259
there's a fair amount of you know he

00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:44,029
gets feedback and he takes pins

00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:45,679
I guess he spends a lot of time thinking

00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:47,690
about that and I think that's basically

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,950
what I mean by this is to make sure that

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:55,639
we listen to the data and cook it and

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,169
use it because of pairing there's not a

00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:59,419
lot of documentation this is something

00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:01,129
that Jules mentioned right and it's a

00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:03,499
good thing and a bad thing right the

00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:06,019
good thing is there's tacit knowledge it

00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:08,330
sort of floats around pivotal but it's a

00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:12,169
pivotal right and of course there's a

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:14,539
fair amount of it and github and readme

00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,849
and so on but a lot of the knowledge is

00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:18,710
mostly at pivotal so if you go there and

00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,820
you pair you'll be in that soup and

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,859
you'll be happy

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,169
but if you're external well you got a

00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:25,549
problem now of course because it's open

00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,049
at the end of the day you can always

00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:32,389
read the code and figure it out all

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:34,249
right use a source kind of deal I've

00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:36,739
been programming Guling for the past two

00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:38,659
months and I like it a lot but I also

00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:40,309
know that it's not a panacea and I'm not

00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:41,419
saying that people are pivotal see it

00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:43,159
that way

00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:44,899
but I think it's important to kind of

00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,369
remind ourselves this it's like every

00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:48,739
other programming language it solves a

00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:51,229
problem it solves a particular space but

00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:53,059
in some other cases it may not be the

00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:54,799
best I mean Ruby does a very decent job

00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:58,339
for a lot of things so I think that's

00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,649
something to remember and then the other

00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:02,509
more subtle one is I don't know if

00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:07,210
you've heard about the big ball of mud

00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:08,719
it's there's a researcher at I guess she

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:13,369
University of you don't know

00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:16,279
Illinois Brian who talked about this

00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:18,859
which is that over time all software

00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,539
become big balls of mud and what by that

00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:22,879
it means that it becomes very hard

00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,950
entropy sets in and I think it doesn't

00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:26,960
matter if you write it and go or you

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,940
write it in Java write it in Ruby it

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,149
just so happens when software is very

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,159
big it tends to happen so I don't think

00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:35,659
you know moving to a different language

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,399
will solve this it's just a matter of

00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:39,169
like you know when you get it the second

00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:41,479
time you do it better right so that

00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:44,330
happens right and then of course TDD

00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:46,219
while it's great I love it I mean you

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,580
can see you have written papers about

00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:51,169
TDD it can be very much abused and I've

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,049
seen this at pivotal and they know that

00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:55,909
okay so a lot of this is not just brand

00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:57,210
new I'm sure you talk to some folks a

00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:58,830
pivot or they tell you we

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:03,240
been talking about this but that those

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:05,549
are the realities and to finish I would

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,320
highly recommend it right I mean we both

00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:09,270
would highly recommend it I know talking

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,240
to Jules he actually went to the dojo

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,520
program before me and you know we've

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,200
only had very positive things generally

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,789
to say about it so if you're thinking

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,230
about it or your engineers are thinking

00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,539
about it you should definitely do it

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,250
you should practice TDD if you're not if

00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,840
you've never done this and sorry any

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,120
programming so that when you get there

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,080
it's not such a shock for you

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,070
be ready to be nice you know if you're

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,480
thinking you're going to go there and

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,580
take over well maybe that's not the

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,830
right culture for you so you want to

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:42,240
learn that culture embed yourself try to

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:46,020
be open and be nice to be like them I

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,000
guess that you know do that and because

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,220
very few places do agile as much as

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,260
pivotal think of it as an opportunity to

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,169
learn at least for me it was and and I

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,730
think I speak for Jules as well and

00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:59,970
continue adding to your company's

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:04,830
credibility so with that we will stop

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:06,919
and see if you have any questions thank

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,919
you

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:24,520
we have five minutes yes when you write

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:24,820
good as a pair ah okay you want to take

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,890
this

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,980
so this there's a there's a couple of

00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:32,350
ways it used to be that you would you

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,210
would sort of make the name first name

00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,430
and second name and then pick an email

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,830
address with the tool calls I think get

00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,420
pad but nowadays there's one that I

00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,760
think is a bit better called get direct

00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,320
and that will set one of you to be the

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,010
author of the commit and one of you to

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,350
be the committer

00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,690
and that way you both get a proper

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:53,500
credit and that's open source on github

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:55,600
I think it's get herb something do that

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,860
thank you if you go if you go to the

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,110
commit on github you'll see both

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,760
people's here's one that's gonna be

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:03,520
selected to be the committer but it's

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,710
done I think in random fashion so over

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,380
time you know there should be a balance

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:14,860
where fifty percent will be committed on

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:21,180
each other questions yes I didn't hear

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:21,180
okay on the back sorry yeah go ahead

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:36,090
how can you do extreme pair programming

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:40,499
Oh from remote location okay you remote

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:42,570
yes so it's sometimes challenging you

00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:44,009
know the ideal thing for pair

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:49,049
programming is to be in the same room

00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:51,119
that is clear there are ways around it

00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:53,039
so there are tools one that I've used a

00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,509
lot is screen hero which is awesome

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,220
which gives you sort of a screen share

00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:58,980
so you're both sort of on the same

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,889
screen and each of you can type use your

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,419
mouse on the same screen there's other

00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:08,820
ones you can use team apps to share a

00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:11,669
theme session it's it's it's not as good

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,590
as being in the same room but you you

00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:16,080
can set up your iPad next to your screen

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,899
with a light or a hangout so you get a

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,850
bit of visual contact you can have

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:22,109
meetups like this which really helps so

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,450
you can meet the people that you're

00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:26,489
pairing with if you've you haven't gone

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,690
through the dojo you know a few the

00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:30,090
people a bit more which gives you a

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:32,609
little bit of rapport when you then pair

00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:35,249
with people I think it's things like

00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:39,480
that it there isn't a perfect answer I'm

00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:41,999
not sure that I'm not sure that pairing

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,489
is something that is ever going to be as

00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:46,950
good in a remote context but you can

00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:49,919
make it work and me and Michael were

00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,989
pairing a lot of last week and it's it's

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,399
completely possible to para like me the

00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:55,470
biggest thing actually is time so it's

00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:57,179
time zones of what time zones more than

00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,149
anything else to what or what hurt

00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:02,399
because I'm eight hours out that's

00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:04,980
painful the only thing I would add to

00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:07,139
this is have not remotely paired so

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,669
certainly Jules has the experience and

00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:10,259
some other people here but I can tell

00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:13,109
you when you go to pivot or if you do a

00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:15,450
visit especially during the time when

00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:17,820
the hours there people are working and

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,850
pairing if you walk around you'll see a

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:23,279
few people with a another screen and

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,720
nobody else next to them and usually

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,820
they are basically remote pairing so

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,369
pivotal itself does remote pairing with

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,739
I think teams from Boulder and teams

00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:35,159
even from from New York and other places

00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:38,119
so you know it I mean it

00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,440
your management will vary but it happens

00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:47,030
okay any other questions

00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,030
oh yes you shout

00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:59,500
how do you decide who works on it all

00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,390
right so this is something I think the

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,600
culture so how do you decide who's on

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:06,190
the keyboard versus yes yeah yeah so the

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,510
question was how do you decide when

00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,880
you're pairing who's on the keyboard

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:13,030
versus who's not on a keyboard and vice

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,490
versa I'm on the keyboard yeah exactly

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,590
so it's kind of the way we're trying to

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,690
do this presentation here where I say

00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:22,570
something and and and I guess Julianne

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,910
interjected and you have to be good at I

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:27,630
guess this is also maybe the why the

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:29,890
culture there is to be nice because

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,800
clearly if you're dominating the

00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:35,320
keyboard it's gonna be a problem right

00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,240
for your peer and they will have to stop

00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,210
and say well you know maybe let me jump

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,190
in so you know part of the idea of

00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:45,220
pairing is to make sure that everybody

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:48,760
gets a chance to work as one but

00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:50,740
essentially as a team small micro team

00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,860
during that time so typically what

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:57,160
happens for me is that I get to learn

00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:59,170
the person's personality and the way

00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,600
they like to work very quickly within

00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:04,300
let's say half a day and I tend to try

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,040
to adjust from it but generally it's you

00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,350
work on something you spend some time

00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,090
well maybe you do the test and then the

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,740
other person does the could or you do

00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,900
the could and the protis person does a

00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,460
test you kind of do that that's maybe a

00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,370
good way to start the other way is to

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,500
essentially you know ask for it so you

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:23,110
wanna yeah I think I think what you find

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,270
is there's like some patterns for doing

00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,550
it right like dryers some people do a

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,140
pattern where won't abuse the driver and

00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:32,020
one of yous the Navigator and things

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:35,260
like this but normally if it's working

00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:38,590
well that goes away right that's those

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,000
are sort of stabilisers your bike right

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,580
you can start out with one of these

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,990
patterns maybe one of you writes a unit

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,210
test one of you writes the code you go

00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,490
back and forth but once you get into it

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,170
I think you pretty much almost always

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,940
find that you get into just a rhythm

00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,040
where it's kind of clear you know if

00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,050
someone's got an idea someone because

00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,090
you're talking all the time I think that

00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:00,700
the thing that strikes you most about

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,380
pairing really struck me most actually

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,480
feeling the most since not parents

00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,310
while after going back if you really

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,250
miss having someone to talk to because

00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:10,810
what you end up doing is is having this

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,770
conversation what do you think is the

00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:14,080
best way of doing this what do you think

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,390
is how we might do this and because it's

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,040
it's not I'm typing I'm typing I'm

00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,740
typing there's a lot of talking going on

00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,870
and a lot of communication and in that

00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,950
context it becomes clear you know I'm

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,320
gonna write this I'm gonna write this

00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,000
because it's that conversation and the

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,680
conversation doesn't need you know in

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,860
the conversations that who have you know

00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,900
who talks at what time in a conversation

00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,020
like it's clear in the context of a

00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,580
conversation he talks nice excellent

00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:49,480
okay maybe the last question in or

00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:50,950
finish Rachel so the question was can

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,800
you comment on the productivity of

00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:57,430
working in pairs versus not working in

00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:01,450
pairs I'll be brief and then get you a

00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:03,940
chance to chime in so when I did my PhD

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,820
I worked for one of the person that

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,130
actually essentially did her PhD on that

00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,110
the whole parent Lori William so I'll

00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,220
give her quick things so if you don't

00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,690
know where you can google or Lori

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,780
Williams and North Carolina State

00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,520
University and one of the things that

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,670
she came up on a PhD was that

00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:24,180
productivity there is some difference

00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:27,210
but generally it's it's it's negligible

00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,500
generally partly because there's so much

00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:32,440
constant feedback that the quality of

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,180
the code is much better there's less

00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,220
need for documentation so therefore you

00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,110
can kind of remove this so overall

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,300
things kind of smoothen out when it

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,040
comes to productivity so it's not like

00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,170
you get half the productivity you

00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,790
actually get as much productivity as two

00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,280
people doing it separately because they

00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,840
end up having much more bugs and other

00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,990
issues so you want to take a look at

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,630
that my personal experience was that I

00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,640
have not had mean partly because there's

00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:01,510
also no not not a lot of pressure on

00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,510
schedule that I find that we would cook

00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:08,740
up you know two or three points

00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:10,360
sometimes per day pairing and so for me

00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,550
this is just as much I would do by

00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,960
myself because there's a constant person

00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:17,730
there to discuss I find that I slack

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,890
which again I was saying we need more

00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:21,780
stock but it's also bad when you have a

00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,130
lot of stack especially email right you

00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,230
spend a lot of time doing email email

00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,690
email email it's ridiculous right you

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:30,120
should be coding and the other person

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,400
helps you remind you so personally I

00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,350
find it to be you know as productive if

00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,230
not more productive than am when I'm by

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:39,330
myself well I think that's that's I

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,610
think that's exactly right I think you

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,320
find you work much harder in practice in

00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,060
the day the reality is you're checking

00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:49,080
Twitter less right is there someone

00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,820
pairing with you what's more I think

00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,110
because you're working this constant

00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,750
pace ninety-five each day you're gaining

00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:57,300
a lot done in those nine to five the

00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,850
only thing I would say is there is an

00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,520
extent to which I think there is a

00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:04,950
psychology of some people which is a lot

00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,660
more suited not working that hard for

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,150
three or four days and then working

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,340
really hard you know and you know

00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:14,280
pushing something out and doing that

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,380
sort of you know the Sprint versus

00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,390
marathons right and there's a lot to be

00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,100
said for that sustainable marathon pace

00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,270
if you get with Perry you know exactly

00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,660
what you're getting you're delivering at

00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:26,160
constant pace but I've certainly written

00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,990
something some times where it came you

00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,160
know you get passionate about something

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,080
there's a thing that I really want to

00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,970
build and now I'm gonna really go and

00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,550
build that and I think that's sometimes

00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:38,490
a bit harder in the in a pair

00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,480
programming context but I'm not sure

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,700
that's the difference between the

00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,710
productivity of the two so much is the

00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,360
cycle that this psychology of it I think

00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,830
maybe just that I find it enjoyable to

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,870
do those sort of big sprints you know

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:51,870
you feel really great about yourself

00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:54,090
that you know I lied I'm you know so so

00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,850
hardcore right I don't push through this

00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,230
thing but I don't it I was actually more

00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:03,330
productive than I would have been at

00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:04,380
that sustainable pace so I I certainly

00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,200
think you get some very high quality

00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:10,170
code on a pretty regular basis with it

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,350
so okay with that times up so thank you

00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:16,640
for coming we'll be here

00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,640
