how're you all doing raise your hand if

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,900
you were here last year phenomenal

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:13,019
returns raise your hand if you're here

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,179
new okay everybody who raised their hand

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,160
first look around please hold your hands

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,960
up if you're new we are a welcoming

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,580
community make eye contact with somebody

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,470
whose hand is up and commit yourself to

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,330
help them out

00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,170
help help them around they're gonna need

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,510
your help and we'll talk about

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,220
ambassadors later so I want to talk to

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,349
you today a little bit about who we are

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,610
what we do where we come from and where

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,320
we're going a little bit about our

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,329
technology and a little bit about our

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,640
community many of you know that I'm a

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,899
Zen Buddhist I couldn't help but rip off

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,059
is in and the art of motorcycle

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,129
maintenance to talk to you about my

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,760
favorite platform so Zen in the art of

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,070
platform this is an N so it's something

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,410
you probably associated with Zen it's a

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,480
calligraphic form and it means emptiness

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,739
it also means enlightenment to me it

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,550
means bringing things together

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,960
unification unification is a theme an

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,159
open source because open source is a

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,570
positive sum game much like love the

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,040
more that you offer the more there is

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,680
available the more that you'll get back

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,549
so open source works with those exact

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,970
same economic principles so in non zero

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,740
Robert Wright wrote the history of

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,390
civilization is a history of positive

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,000
some games played at larger and larger

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,060
scales and then he spends about 300

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,860
pages proving it so he says that the

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,590
scale of the game is how many people can

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,759
I call self instead of other as human

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,490
beings we like to draw a bright line

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,619
between self and other other is bad

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,720
scary and we all keep it at arm's length

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,159
or fight it and self of course is good

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,530
we have a lot of trust we can play games

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,509
together that are fun and don't cause

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,210
anybody to lose the opposite of a

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,280
positive sum game is a zero-sum game in

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,710
which for me to win you have to lose

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,159
those aren't actually that exciting

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,649
a positive sum game that all of us know

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,229
is family it's played with a very small

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,090
structure of parents and children divide

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,969
the labor you work together right you

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,069
try to create more than you had before

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:09,599
that's a very simple policy so if we

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,819
look at a polity as a structure within

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,930
which we have that bright line of self

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,689
another we can look at the march of the

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,670
over time you have self as a tribe

00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:20,349
people here have probably heard of the

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,359
Dunbar number about a hundred and forty

00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,549
hundred fifty people that you can be in

00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:26,980
consistent continuous relationship with

00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:28,599
once you get to a tribe people survive

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,400
much better you have divisions of labor

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,170
you have the ability to do simple things

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,379
like food sharing or you can have skills

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:37,889
but over time frictions show up because

00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:40,810
larger polities get to play a larger

00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,939
positive some games together so a

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,680
chiefdom defeats a tribe and absorbs it

00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:47,049
a city-state defeats a cheap them and

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,400
absorbs it these translocations right

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,840
these shifts are often very

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,849
uncomfortable there's a lot of chaos in

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,500
them now we're at nation-states maybe

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:55,750
hanging towards a world state who knows

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,030
what that will look like but as a model

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,680
we can just see its economics right game

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,090
theory shows us that the more people we

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,219
can call self instead of other the more

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,620
successful we are we've done that in

00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:08,079
corporations at one point we said well

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,939
maybe self is a company probably a lot

00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:11,019
of you feel this way right you're some

00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,340
of your best friends hopefully the

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,590
people you're spending 50 hours a week

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,319
with at work we spend more time doing

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,569
that when we do with our families if we

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,659
walk up the path of evolution of

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,040
companies we see sole proprietors

00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,989
partnerships LLC's corporations

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,879
multinationals right this is sort of the

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,040
massive scale that we're at in creating

00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,970
positive some games right in these in

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,430
these boundaries what's crazy and new is

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,889
this open source concept that self can

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,079
equal project right we look back 20

00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,430
years we look at Linux 15 years and we

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,590
talk about the Linux kernel development

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,599
project if you're a Linux kernel

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,340
developer you look at any other kernel

00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:50,680
developer regardless of what company

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,389
they work at and you go wow that's that

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,120
self right they look at corporate

00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,280
boundaries as if they don't even exist

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,780
so as cloud foundry establishes itself

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,790
as you start to think of yourself as

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,500
part of cloud foundry all the people

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,030
sitting around you or friends you

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,970
haven't yet met you are playing

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,459
positive-sum games with each of them

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:12,489
this is the unity of the positive sum

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:15,639
game of cloud foundry it turns out that

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,019
it gets even stronger the more that we

00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,690
think about who we're including in the

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,060
circle the more powerful we get we

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,599
include developers users providers and

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,580
operators all is equal citizens sitting

00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,810
around the Ring

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,849
nobody's in the middle noise on the

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,039
outside how do we contribute to what

00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:34,500
this platform needs to become that's

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:37,259
what we built the system for that's what

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,430
you're part of it turns out we can

00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,110
double dip because not only is

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,050
open-source a positive sum game but

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,979
platta platforms are positive some games

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,180
if you look at the structure of a

00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,099
platform it's the opposite of a

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,169
traditional business it's an inverted

00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:51,900
pyramid of power it's one in which

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,330
service to users is the highest virtue

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,080
at the bottom you have a single platform

00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:00,150
as you scale up to many products many

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,250
many services many many many solutions

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,349
and then fulfill the needs of a vast

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,669
number of users that whole thing cycles

00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:07,469
through the requirements of the users

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:09,180
feedback down to the platform through

00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:12,120
these tiers as the platform gets better

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,280
each of those levels is uplifted so the

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,789
more people that we can support the

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,639
greater the platform platforms drive

00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:23,039
network effects it's the most advanced

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,270
business model we're aware of today if

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,770
you're familiar with uber if you're

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,650
familiar with Airbnb if you're familiar

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,500
with GE predicts which I'll talk about a

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,469
little bit more very soon you know that

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,139
platforms drive network effects does

00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:39,629
anybody know who the greatest

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:40,979
salesperson was in history actually if

00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:44,279
she don't know that person's name but

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:46,889
the classic network effect is a

00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,690
telephone one telephone by itself is not

00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,879
that useful so the greatest salesperson

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,190
ever sold the first telephone a

00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:57,599
completely useless thing sitting on a

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:59,339
desk but you add one more phone you add

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:00,719
one more phone you add one more phone

00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,270
and you get exponential growth in the

00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:04,500
value of being on the phone network so

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,650
all of us have experience in network

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,819
effects they run away very quickly they

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,770
turn into back of the chessboard

00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,120
problems where the exponents start to

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,279
get out of hand and you can't even

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,789
imagine why a company that owns no cars

00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,789
is valued at is valued higher than Honda

00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:26,219
recently Marshall Van Alstyne Geoffrey

00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:27,900
Parker and Sangeet Paul Chaudhary

00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,479
published this book that's just out in

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,509
February looking at the last 15 years of

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,159
platforms digging up the complex

00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:37,380
economics of them but they all come down

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:39,839
to a very simple solution the more

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,670
people we can include in a platform the

00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,040
greater the network

00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,720
right so that brings us back to our

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,110
opportunity and our responsibility

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,410
bringing developers users providers and

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,450
operators all together so to achieve

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,220
that what we've what we focused on is

00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,500
understanding the two sides to how

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,270
platforms grow as cash or swaminathan

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,570
who is the chief scientist at Accenture

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,550
up to 2009 said there's really two sides

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,730
of this there's an ecosystem of mutually

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,530
reinforcing technologies right we all

00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,730
have systems like this right if you're

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,070
using a mobile phone you're there

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,510
because the technologies work together

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,550
you're also there because there's been

00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,310
adoption every user coming onto the

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,470
platform has also driven new demand for

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,030
new technologies to be built those

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,100
technologies reinforce each other and

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,050
make it safer for more users to join the

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,670
platform so you actually have a flywheel

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,380
effect where we continue to see it spin

00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,700
it's what we've seen with cloud foundry

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,700
and I'll walk you through some of those

00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,990
statistics but most importantly we have

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,790
to focus our own efforts as

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,590
technologists to understand how we fit

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,560
inside this system and how do we make it

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,390
better an ecosystem of mutually

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,760
reinforcing technologies really depends

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,020
on standardization otherwise the

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,420
connections as you get to that

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,800
exponential network they become too hard

00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,050
to solve in computer science we'd say

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,610
it's np-complete so how do we flatten

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,820
the curve how do we reduce the number of

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,140
connections well we have to standardize

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,640
who here thinks that the light bulbs a

00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,820
great example of standardization is that

00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,220
what we should do okay so this is a

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,670
incandescent light bulb recently

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,770
outlawed in places like Australia dr.

00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,630
Nick because obviously they're trying to

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,030
control how much energy is used and how

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,530
much carbon footprint we have so what we

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,680
standardized instead and turns out is

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,720
the socket we standardized the socket

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,310
not only we can have one set of

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,950
infrastructure that gets laid in and

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,850
stays in place for years

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,230
technology can advance and we can have

00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,780
very different ideas about what we

00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,570
should put in compact fluorescents also

00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:38,810
a CF see what I did there

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,070
it's LPG all of these use advanced

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,720
technologies and we get to continue to

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,070
move the world forward this particular

00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,270
piece of innovation I'm quite fascinated

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,980
by over the next five years 80% of the

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,490
fleet of light bulbs at least in the

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,540
United States will be replaced this is a

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,550
once in a century event no

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,870
that simply doesn't happen because you

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,300
just kind of replace and piece by piece

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,310
but because there are mandates on how

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,889
much electricity you can use how you

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:07,589
generate power we're not putting LEDs in

00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:09,540
every every corporate campus soon every

00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,250
house what's amazing about these LEDs is

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,930
they are little computers they have

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,149
transistors and people are adding

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,800
sensors they're adding wireless networks

00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:21,300
so the future of lighting plugging into

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,949
sorry can we go back one the feature of

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,069
lighting plugging into that standard

00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:28,529
socket is giving us an internet of

00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:30,389
sensors by being in the same place

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,220
creating mesh networks giving us access

00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:33,839
to heat temperature control and of

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,779
course doing all the processing through

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,160
a platform cloud foundry where we

00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,860
standardized then in the case of the

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,540
platform in order to achieve this world

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:47,850
we launched in December cloud foundry

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:50,490
certified so what we tried to do in that

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,779
process is to be able to give a durable

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,399
infrastructure something that you could

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,769
rely on like a light socket

00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,149
but then software of course is more

00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,399
difficult than light sockets because

00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:01,410
it's complex and it's moving the cloud

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,329
is changing all the time and open source

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,940
changes all the time it's a living

00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:08,699
project not a dead project so we time

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,019
stamped it like a car model we said how

00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,279
do you know which cloud founder you're

00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,019
running on and how do we move the whole

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,269
ecosystem forward how do we support

00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:19,319
everybody in that inverted pyramid said

00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:21,540
well certified 2016 so this year we'll

00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:24,300
be announcing the requirements for 2017

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,920
which will launch next January with this

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,389
certification which certifies the

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,180
runtime and ensures that you have

00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:31,920
consistent API base needs make sure that

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,500
you have a consistent deployment and

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,899
operator skill set then we can support

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,449
this massive platform with cloud foundry

00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,949
and no matter where you go you will be

00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,529
able to have these exact same guarantees

00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:44,699
that one cloud foundry platform will be

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:46,620
able to have tens of thousands of

00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:48,389
products hundreds of thousands of

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,819
services millions of solutions

00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:52,319
supporting hundreds of millions of users

00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:53,819
this is what we are building right this

00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:56,370
is that this is the vision for our

00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:58,709
ecosystem all of this with strong

00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,630
economic activity keeping us all

00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:04,189
employed and moving forward because we

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,750
have to get paid to work on software now

00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:07,470
today I'm delighted to announce that two

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,030
more

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,700
major companies have joined

00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:14,100
certification a toss has just announced

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:21,840
a toss Cloud Foundry let's give them a

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:23,670
hand a toss is about eleven billion

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,550
dollar company with thousands of

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,790
consultants building out complex cloud

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,530
solutions they have been working on

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,820
Cloud Foundry for many years they work

00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,260
with pivotal they have pivotal Cloud

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,090
Foundry today they're certifying a

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,040
tossed cloud foundry which is their

00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,280
version of their their distribution of

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,780
the open source upstream second and it

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,070
may come as some surprise because maybe

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,320
you thought that we were simply the

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,270
secret batteries inside ge predicts the

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,620
industrial Internet of Things but ge

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,690
predicts announced today that they

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:58,950
certified on Cloud Foundry so let's give

00:11:51,690 --> 00:12:00,870
GE hand as well so why does all this

00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,030
matter it matters because of multi cloud

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,860
each of these companies is helping

00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,290
customers deal with a multi cloud

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,390
reality we don't believe that a single

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,460
cloud is right for everybody where we

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,170
found four in real life is that on

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,650
average enterprises are using about four

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,850
point six clouds four point six clouds

00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,820
that's like having two point four

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,350
children in a white picket fence but

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,210
multi cloud is here it's already

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,340
happened it happened before any analysts

00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,410
counted it it happened before any CIO

00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,320
voted on it or mandated it it just kind

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,270
of crept in so in response to that Cloud

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,160
Foundry as the platform supported and

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:38,030
built by all of these companies that

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,440
runs your workloads on multiple clouds

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,930
so that's where we are today it's an

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,440
awesome place to be right pivotal HP es

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:49,320
ap IBM 8oz GE Swisscom Huawei and

00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,150
CenturyLink have all achieved technical

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,680
certification for 2016

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,930
means that you own your apps and you can

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,260
run that workload on any cloud you think

00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,530
best

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,090
including 4.6 clouds but where are we

00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:04,800
going let me let me take a shot of the

00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:07,650
horizon so many platforms support only

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,060
custom application development but you

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,740
know you've got a real platform for the

00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,810
ages when you have packaged apps and

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,490
packaged services on the package

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,280
services piece you want to be able to

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,680
expand the the Cloud Foundry platform

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,200
capability infinitely so in Cloud

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,720
Foundry we've got a phenomenal Technol

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,610
she called the CF service broker and

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,650
it's bridged by the CF service broker

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,620
API we found that there's a very

00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:32,450
significant community even broader than

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,550
cloud foundry that admires our service

00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,020
broker wants to plug into it wants to

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,520
build more capabilities and wants to

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,560
bridge it to other open source projects

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,000
this is a huge thing so our approach to

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,960
services is becoming an industry

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,280
standard packaged apps should run on any

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,980
cloud foundry it simplifies the

00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,900
economics for any ISP just think about

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,060
how how many apps there are on your

00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,620
mobile phone how many apps did you used

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,810
to use on your desktop maybe 15 years

00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,480
ago probably one-tenth the number of the

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,860
apps that you have on your mobile phone

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,060
software got smaller it got right size

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,260
because there was a very simple

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,550
deployment target and there was an

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,970
effective marketplace whether you're

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,590
iTunes or Google Play or whatnot so our

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,300
opportunity is to create that kind of

00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,070
simplicity and packaging format for

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,770
enterprise apps that lets them run on

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,800
any Cloud Foundry anywhere creating a

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,150
unified global application ecosystem

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,860
think of the hundreds of thousands of

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,140
developers who can build right-sized

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,390
applications for the enterprise and make

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:32,260
enterprise software suck just a little

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:34,940
bit less so let's take this forward

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,560
let's focus ourselves as a community and

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,390
say we're going to continue to push

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,880
Cloud Foundry forward as the standard

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,460
and that standard is going to draw with

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,770
it a global economically successful

00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,150
community providing packaged services

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,220
that can be used by cloud foundry

00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,840
deployments anywhere creating economic

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,550
opportunity for every service developer

00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,220
every service provider whether it's

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:58,490
Cassandra or react or Twilio or

00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,190
something custom whether it's whether

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:04,310
it's CRM systems whether it's message

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,720
queues at the top let's make sure that

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,820
we have a packaging format that works

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,110
for the ISVs because when I as we start

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,610
adopting your platform they will just

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,870
drag the platform in there and you'll be

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:17,270
surrounded by cloud foundry things will

00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,010
just work to get there we're gonna need

00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,390
velocity one of the things that we were

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,310
challenged with a year ago is if you're

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,020
going to vastly increase the number of

00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,370
contributors to the project if you're

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,800
going to vastly increase the number of

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,590
members involved how do we make sure

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,270
that that project doesn't slow down well

00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,980
I'm very pleased to say looking back on

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,320
the last year our numbers are

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,330
awesome right there there in the elite

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,020
of all open-source software projects

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:45,250
over 2300 patches by people who are not

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:48,110
core committers over 2100 contributors

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,040
130 core committers now let me talk to

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,720
you about the core committers for a

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,480
moment these are the men and women who

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,010
are engineering their hearts out working

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,140
full-time on the project they have

00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,970
commit rights on all of the 17 projects

00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,940
in the open-source many of them also

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,740
rotate off and build their own company's

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,590
extended capabilities that built around

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,230
Cloud Foundry this compares favorably to

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,960
the number of core committers on on an

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,550
open stack about the same and to Linux

00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,930
so many of you might have thought while

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,700
Linux has got tens of thousands of

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,290
developers it's true but when you start

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,360
measuring like-for-like and who's

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,700
spending all of their time building the

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,170
project you'll find that we are we are

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,990
neck-and-neck with the leaders that's

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,520
why we've moved so fast over 25 releases

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,470
in the last year roughly release every

00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,960
two weeks of a complete working project

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,580
which is effectively our product you can

00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,270
pull from cloud foundry upstream and it

00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:41,060
will work it's a release I mentioned

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,510
multi-cloud all of these releases

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,820
support AWS Google cloud platform

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:49,520
Microsoft Azure vmware vsphere OpenStack

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,130
of variety of various flavors soft layer

00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,280
and rocky HD this is a really big deal

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:57,500
because it simplifies the experience for

00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,330
developers one consistent developer

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,760
experience on the platform across all

00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,320
these different infrastructures now

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,510
interesting we we've had a better

00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,640
release every two weeks we've also had a

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,020
member join about every two weeks so

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,840
when we started the foundation we had

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,310
about 26 members now we have 63 it's

00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,410
pretty awesome you've seen a number of

00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,510
announcements today and you'll see more

00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,220
throughout the week it's also a

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,780
wonderfully self-organizing community

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,310
that you're part of apart from the big

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,080
summits that we put on in north america

00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,800
and europe and in asia there are a

00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,080
hundred and seventy-three

00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,550
self-organizing user groups with over

00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,640
three and a half thousand individual

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,840
members in 105 cities and 48 countries

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,280
this is an awe-inspiring

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,310
moment for me to be able to look back on

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,690
the year behind and imagine if these is

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,700
if this is what we did is a community

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,490
last year and we're growing what is what

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,170
is this going to look like next year so

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,970
let me close by bringing you back to our

00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,630
collective vision right what what is

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,860
cloud foundry

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,440
about who are you as part of this

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,730
community we see a world of cloud

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,530
computing that is ubiquitous and

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,290
flexible it supports multi cloud

00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,240
application environments it's portable

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,650
and interoperable enabling users to move

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,960
their applications wherever they need to

00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,030
go and it's vibrant and growing

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,910
underlying a massive ecosystem of

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,350
applications and services most

00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,870
importantly and as we come together as a

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,270
community I want you to recognize the

00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,070
standards we hold for ourselves right we

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,140
see a human community that is pragmatic

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,840
and focused on exchanging practical

00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,940
experience its diverse and inclusive of

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,490
people across race gender orientation

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,690
and lifestyle we take this tremendously

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,550
seriously we take it as our

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,010
responsibility and our privilege and

00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,450
finally we're respectful we're committed

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:35,300
to listening to thoughtful and honest

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,430
perspectives so with that I offer you

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,990

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,760
a moment before we bring dr. dr. Nick

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:57,150
back on stage and I'm gonna say we have

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,560
the privilege of hosting some truly

00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,150
committed individuals people who have

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,280
been part of the Cloud Foundry community

00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,140
in some case for years who have

00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,910
volunteered themselves their times and

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,950
their good and their good will to

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,780
support all of us in the journey so

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,640
today we're announcing the Cloud Foundry

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,680
ambassadors and I would like all of the

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,210
ambassadors who are seated in the in the

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,400
crowd especially those in the front

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,780
please come and join me on stage so that

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,430
the community can see you together and

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:35,580
let's give them a big hand as they come

00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:38,550
on good to see you alright we'll see if

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,970
the stage is big enough we might need a

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,970
bigger boat

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,500
dr. Nick you're Australian you should

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,710
tell us how to stand lobbyists on our

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,710
heads

00:19:51,890 --> 00:20:00,390
keep coming there's more room now feel a

00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,400
little quit all right so mark would you

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,440
hold up your badge

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,110
so can can you focus the camera on the

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,660
red ambassador tag so if you if you

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,700
can't instantly memorize the faces of

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,230
every single person on stage we have

00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,930
helpfully provided you with an API

00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,250
what's that API you might ask it's a

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,440
little red sticker at the bottom of the

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,360
tag so if you see anybody with the red

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,100
tag you could stop them and take them

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,290
for being ambassadors you could ask them

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,330
simple questions or you can access them

00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,010
complicated questions so here's the

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,600
Cloud Foundry ambassadors they will

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,100
