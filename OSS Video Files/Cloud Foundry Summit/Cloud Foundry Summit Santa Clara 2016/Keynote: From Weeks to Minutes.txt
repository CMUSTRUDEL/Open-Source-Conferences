	Keynote: From Weeks to Minutes - Simon Johansson, Platform Engineer, & Daniel Otte, Head of Platform Engineering, Springer Nature

Going from weeks to minutes for app deployments, 0 to 4000 requests per second and 0 to 1200 apps in approximately a year.

 In 2014, Springer Nature development teams were globally distributed with no standardization across groups. From commit to production often took more than two weeks, and tasks like provisioning new VMs, configuring networks and firewalls, load balancing, and writing Chef were chores considered too tedious with which to deal. Tribal knowledge resulted in flaky systems that culminated in dev teams who were overly reliant on different ops teams.

When Platform Engineering began to hear faint whispers of “miiiiicro services,” the company knew it needed to do something drastic. This post will drill down into  how Cloud Foundry changed the culture, allowing devs to own their apps in production and worry less about operational hassles, and how Platform Engineering simplified operations and reduced costs across the board.

Simon Johansson
Platform Engineer, Springer Nature
Dev turned ops, working with Springer Nature which is a global publisher. Have done a keynote at CF Summit Berlin.

Daniel Otte
Head of Platform Engineering, Springer Nature
Now I am become Ops, the destroyer of silos and the bringer of transparency. Currently the head of platform engineering for Springer Nature. It's a team I founded to increase development speed and make sure software can be deployed rapidly and reliable, with the focus on fast feedback. The team fills the gap between ops and dev and by building a PaaS based on Cloud Foundry we have really changed the way we work.
