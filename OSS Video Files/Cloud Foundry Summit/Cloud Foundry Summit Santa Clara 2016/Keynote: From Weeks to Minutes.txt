Description: 
	Keynote: From Weeks to Minutes - Simon Johansson, Platform Engineer, & Daniel Otte, Head of Platform Engineering, Springer Nature

Going from weeks to minutes for app deployments, 0 to 4000 requests per second and 0 to 1200 apps in approximately a year.

 In 2014, Springer Nature development teams were globally distributed with no standardization across groups. From commit to production often took more than two weeks, and tasks like provisioning new VMs, configuring networks and firewalls, load balancing, and writing Chef were chores considered too tedious with which to deal. Tribal knowledge resulted in flaky systems that culminated in dev teams who were overly reliant on different ops teams.

When Platform Engineering began to hear faint whispers of “miiiiicro services,” the company knew it needed to do something drastic. This post will drill down into  how Cloud Foundry changed the culture, allowing devs to own their apps in production and worry less about operational hassles, and how Platform Engineering simplified operations and reduced costs across the board.

Simon Johansson
Platform Engineer, Springer Nature
Dev turned ops, working with Springer Nature which is a global publisher. Have done a keynote at CF Summit Berlin.

Daniel Otte
Head of Platform Engineering, Springer Nature
Now I am become Ops, the destroyer of silos and the bringer of transparency. Currently the head of platform engineering for Springer Nature. It's a team I founded to increase development speed and make sure software can be deployed rapidly and reliable, with the focus on fast feedback. The team fills the gap between ops and dev and by building a PaaS based on Cloud Foundry we have really changed the way we work.

good morning good morning my name is

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,350
Daniel I'm from the Netherlands I'm the

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,570
head of the platform engineering team

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,580
let's bring an H here I'm here with my

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,400
colleague I'm Simon I love platform

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,400
engineer in Daniel sim so yeah

00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,980
it's not working ah no it is so asset we

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,680
work for spring a nature we're a large

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,929
research publisher one of the largest in

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,809
the world we're a global company with

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:37,140
offices everywhere we have about 13,000

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,870
employees hundreds of developers we have

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,590
some well-known online platforms such as

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,079
springerlink biomed central nature

00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,640
scientific America just to name a few

00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,190
this story however is not about

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,199
publishing don't worry it's quite

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,100
generic and I think it will apply to

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,680
many of people here in the audience so

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,710
let's get started yeah so it's basically

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,019
a story about how we took deployments

00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:10,710
from weeks to minutes really how we

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:12,150
prevented a lot of snowflakes so to set

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,780
the scene a little bit I think it's good

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,090
to go back in time the story begins when

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,400
the company decides to bring in one of

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,380
the biggest online platforms we had

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,820
spring a link at that time it was hosted

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,409
by a third party but also that all the

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,850
development was done by the third-party

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:35,369
support and by bringing it in we've got

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,220
quite a big challenge because not only

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,829
had to do all the development but of

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,259
course also the operations and actually

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,560
hosting the physical stuff so yeah quite

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,810
a challenge yeah so we decided to do

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,030
this project with agile methodologies we

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,840
how the thought works and you scale

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,009
everything was super cool and awesome

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,990
yeah so the company realized we can do

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,420
this in-house some more project started

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,090
to pop up all over the globe and this is

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,320
great

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,170
unfortunately though the ops side of the

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,819
business ie us had not at this point on

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,970
through the agile transformations we can

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:15,330
are drowning

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,100
yeah so to paint the picture a little

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,530
bit better of what it was like back then

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,230
to go from an idea to production who

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,720
wants to run a little scenario by you so

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,460
you get a bit of an idea so with any

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,000
good project where would you start Simon

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,250
write some code write some code cool

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,020
what do you need need to request a deal

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,030
to put that code on yeah

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,950
eat some compute resources make sense

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,340
and anything else

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,370
DNS you know the video sure I'm with you

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,230
almost done

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:50,220
confess to store a random stuff on will

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:53,820
be nice NFS edifice okay

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,320
ready to go live or yeah except for the

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,710
firewall in between and the first under

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,570
vm so I need to request a change though

00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,450
okay you need a firewall change so you

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,680
can just walk over to the guys right and

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,090
request a change and then we can get

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,730
going or doing a different countries are

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,260
just a kinetic one all right but now

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,650
we're good right so it's working you got

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,100
the connection to the NFS app is life

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:22,890
yes next up for the public IP ah yeah

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,990
people can't reach it so I'm guessing

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,870
you have to contact the guys in the

00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,690
Netherlands again yes yep nice it's

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,240
gonna take quite long now so I really

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,640
want to push this thing live okay yeah

00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,380
so we've done all this stuff latterly up

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,970
until now so we need to do some

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,370
configuration management configuration

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,590
management yeah that makes sense it's

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,540
quite an important product we expect a

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,080
lot from it so but now we're good to go

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,110
right

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,300
that we good to go with nice the m1 VM

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,790
so we should probably think about not a

00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,960
VM okay I'm guessing you have to go

00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,510
through the whole shebang again so now

00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,650
that we're finally live I got some

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,790
complaints freaking slow so maybe you

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,830
can scale it up a bit

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,530
yeah if you give me some more hardware

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,140
that'd be cool okay so we need to order

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,930
more hardware that's probably gonna take

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:20,470
weeks yeah

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:24,070
no this is not working right I think if

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:29,770
we continue like this we go mad so yeah

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:31,630
this clearly had some consequences we

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,120
saw a lot of frustration in the company

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,789
and people started to work around this

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,320
issues and everywhere silo started to

00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:41,289
pop up people created their own

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,250
solutions lots of local optimizations

00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:47,620
which result in duplicate systems we saw

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,870
Graphite's everywhere I think people

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,580
monitoring the monitoring systems one

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,560
team was using chef and the other team

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,090
was using pepper then ansible was the

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,759
new kid on the block so answer was

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:03,099
overriding puppet and all kinds of fun

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:08,259
in the end unreliable services and what

00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:11,139
do you do so I traveled quite a bit I

00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:14,410
went to the various locations when we

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,960
had our development teams and there were

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,289
the Ops guys embedded in the development

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,090
teams I met Simon so we have many

00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,280
conversations and we thought we can do

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,580
this differently maybe it's time to

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,169
bring all these obstacle together and

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,610
think a little bit more globally maybe

00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,409
we can provide them with one solution

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:37,590
and deduplicate all of this mess and

00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:42,820
that's when we created a new team

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:44,680
platform engineering we we had a mission

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,229
to make sure that people could release

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,710
more often we're gonna fix all the mess

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:52,860
and we would be the new heroes in town

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:56,289
nice and we would make everything go

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,000
faster right ah yeah yeah yeah so I mean

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,729
we wanted to be something really

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,659
reliable scalable and repeatable kind of

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:05,050
like the six billion dollar

00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:08,349
infrastructure so yeah a short recap on

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:11,259
that I think brought in-house

00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:13,599
development from out sourced super nice

00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:15,610
but it resulted in local optimization as

00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:18,120
silos but the platform and here and the

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,120
nearing team is formed that's nice

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,120
sweet

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,760
but now what well don't worry because we

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,330
have the platform engineering team and

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,600
we knew exactly what to do we knew of

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:37,000
course what the people wanted so we went

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,970
into the cave at a meeting in Berlin

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,830
spent three days with each other we

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,660
listed out all the issues that we knew

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,730
that were there and came up with lots of

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,100
solutions I think it was pretty awesome

00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,420
right yeah it was super cool as Daniel

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,190
mentioned earlier we came from different

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,290
locations from different development

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:56,260
streams so we knew where all the pain

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,740
point worse for both us people and for

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,560
developers so we knew where to focus

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,500
clearly what we needed was faster horses

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,960
was the horses obviously it's stupid to

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,170
wait you know days for we VM and it's

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,360
stupid to wait DNS changes for days we

00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,250
had crappy ma configuration management

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,950
so we want to fix that so it's gonna be

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,980
super flexible and awesome so we went

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,820
into the cave again and started to work

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,470
and it was going pretty well

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:31,090
yeah we came up with some pretty good

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:34,920
solutions until well yeah yeah people

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:39,220
started talking about micro services and

00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,260
we knew were in for some new trouble all

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,450
these nice configuration management and

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,310
all these nice automation would have

00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,890
been nice with a couple of monoliths but

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,140
when you start thinking about micro

00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:53,380
services and things gonna explode into

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:56,950
200-300 or even more little services

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,600
that's obviously not gonna work so we

00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:02,230
were on the wrong path and we needed to

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,300
rethink our strategy so we went back got

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,040
together and we decided to do things a

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,650
little bit differently this time around

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,110
yeah so instead of going in three cave

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,290
this time we went out of it to talk to

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,250
the people that we were supposed to help

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,470
turned out they don't really care about

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,950
BMS and configuration management and

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:23,070
other cool stuff they only really cared

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,070
about

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,550
they all goat yeah I just wanna run the

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,139
code right now wanted to take their

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,529
application and put it in production as

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:36,020
smooth as possible basically so we ask

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:40,400
them is it a past you want and they were

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:41,960
like a past we want so this is where a

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,339
cloud foundry enters the picture a

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,010
knight in shining armor

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,480
not in designing armor so we started to

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,839
play around with the different paths

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,180
systems that would out there like Dean

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,670
and Flynn and days and all these cool

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,550
dorky based ones and openshift from Red

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,560
Hat and obviously Cloud Foundry but

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,290
unfortunately was pretty clear from the

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,630
beginning that they all more or less

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,460
wanted cloud yeah something we didn't

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:11,210
have our api's was emails and phone

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,800
calls yeah so that was a bummer for all

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,570
of them besides no family cough only

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,820
obviously has Bosch which is super

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,760
amazing and you can do all the

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,380
multi-cloud password stuff without which

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,300
was super nice because we could actually

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,890
deploy cloud foundry in on actual data

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,900
center where the actual applications

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,220
will be running which is important right

00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:33,709
when you come from a kind of old-time

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:36,140
infrastructure the application starts to

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:38,839
take weird shape right where they

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,520
require millisecond latency to s AP and

00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,770
other back of his systems and databases

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,190
so going public wasn't really enough

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,810
option for us yeah so I think after all

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,850
the spiking we were pretty confident

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:53,900
that Cloud Foundry was the way to go for

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:56,959
us we created this series of internal

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,730
presentations made a business case we've

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,920
got all the people aligned everyone was

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,839
excited so we got the green light we

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,000
were ordering the hardware with the Ops

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:11,020
teams wrecking it deploying Cloud

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,020
Foundry it was fantastic right

00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:25,230
no one was using it so we built this

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,360
platform we thought yes we're in the

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,580
right track but turns out no one was

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,830
pushing any apps it's just basically

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:37,160
basically a big dust collector well I

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,710
think it was a couple of things missing

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,350
so the developers had a lack of trust in

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,210
the platform is his production ready and

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,570
also a lack of knowledge how do how does

00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,770
it work but more importantly I think the

00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,710
problem was that there was business as

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:55,530
usual developers as you know are paid to

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,210
deliver features and there was some work

00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,250
to be done at the code to refactor it

00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:03,300
and make it cloud native so it runs in

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:06,570
the platform so we know we had to do

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,130
something so we started selling yeah we

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,370
opposed use it internally for our cool

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,470
stuff but what I want other people to

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,420
use it as well of course so we started

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,610
recording videos and sending sending out

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,350
to the company and we started using

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,480
subliminal messaging so every time we

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,580
would get a request for help we would be

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,810
like okay we will help you but Cloud

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,810
Foundry in the corner is pretty done

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,520
awesome you should try it out and at

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,490
some point we just stopped helping

00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,430
people and were like no use Cloud

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,530
Foundry for your dashboard come on and a

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,170
it worked we got some initial adoption

00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,270
people were happy to put non-business

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,510
critical stuff in there yeah we got some

00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:48,330
small traction but then a little micro

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,980
friends come in to save the day where

00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,590
before we thought we were in trouble now

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,240
we were ready

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,630
no coincident that one of our biggest

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,180
open access platforms was going to be

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,370
rebuilt from scratch they're gonna do it

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,560
completely with micro services and

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,870
together we decided to deploy it on

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,750
Cloud Foundry from day zero and it was

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,880
really good they got so much improvement

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,370
fast feedback they were able to push to

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,160
production without any dependencies to

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,530
ops teams and this inspired other teams

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,880
to also look at their monoliths and

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,220
starting to peel off little things and

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,420
bits and pieces so yeah we got so many

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,220
subtraction

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,710
so we started off with the faster horses

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,010
which was clearly wrong we started to

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:34,170
listen doing some research we came up

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,420
with Cloud Foundry and then we started

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,880
selling it and we got some initial

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:44,070
adoption it's good there's not yet great

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,030
yeah so obviously with new tech new

00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,340
problems arise

00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,470
so yeah cloud funny super awesome you

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,120
can push really quickly which also means

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,520
you can push snowflakes really quickly

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,770
into production so we saw this quite

00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,750
quickly where new teams will pick up the

00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,400
product right claw foundry and start

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,960
building their own automation around how

00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,390
to use the platform how to do their own

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,670
senior downtown deployment rollbacks all

00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,960
these can adjust their walls the

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,670
problems with people because they didn't

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,140
know how do you get a long side of this

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,020
how do you get metrics over this how do

00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:18,240
I monitor my applications inside Cloud

00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:19,470
Foundry so we solve that we got all the

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,630
tech leads together from different

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,370
departments and discussed like how are

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,420
using the platform what are some kind of

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:29,640
generic trades to share and we created

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,760
something we call the spring app and not

00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,940
to me it's basically the 12 factor up

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,650
with some extra constraints around it so

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,100
today you can more or less clone a repo

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:43,320
in any language of choice or framework

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,290
of choice and be really up to speed in

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,200
minutes yeah new project which is cool

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,170
we also did some stuff ourselves right

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:55,620
yeah so we we started generating

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:58,290
pipelines for people we started giving

00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,970
monitoring for free so part of the app

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,950
Anatomy states that your application

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,410
must expose an endpoint set endpoint

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,970
must have a JSON document describing how

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,380
the application should be monitored and

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,090
who should be contacted in case

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,030
something goes wrong

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:15,660
we started generating dashboards logging

00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:17,970
logging big ok spec looking for free all

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,420
sort of nice stuff yeah that was good so

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,190
that's a little bit where we are today

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,410
so we just want to run some numbers by

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:29,550
you so you get a bit of a feeling what

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:32,460
we do so currently in our sec we do

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,040
about 700 deployments in 24 hours to

00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:38,310
development and production we run about

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,410
1400 which together to 3

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,680
a thousand requests per second and so

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,470
global traffic it's all nice but the

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,180
real cool thing is that it has a very

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,190
small footprint if you compare it to

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,920
where we come from it's just a few

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,920
physical boxes it spread across two data

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,170
centers it's a very generic

00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,140
implementation and only three to the

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,400
three people have to maintain this stuff

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:05,760
that would have been impossible I think

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,620
if you look at this comparison yeah I

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,900
won't rehash the numbers but as you can

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,480
see first the hostess can sucks compared

00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,880
to Cloud Foundry everything is really

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,740
nice we can support whatever we want in

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,570
Cloud Foundry you know you can use any

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,010
language you want how we try to do that

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,300
with that faster horses approach we

00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,450
would have ended up with some pretty

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,540
gnarly configuration management but the

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,370
real benefit I guess I think is the fact

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,570
that we can just destroy our Cloud

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,630
Foundry environment and bring it up

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:36,570
again really quickly and we can you know

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,980
respond to security threats really

00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,670
quickly so we have to patch everything

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,040
without developers even knowing it yeah

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,920
thanks to Bosh thanks Bosh everything is

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,850
groovy in Cloud Foundry lund yeah

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,640
something else I want to mention is that

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,589
we we did see a from scratch so we

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,500
basically use the community released

00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:57,390
directly upstream which i think is quite

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,300
cool for a large company as spring a

00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,880
nature is that we have all our mission

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,430
critical business applications on top of

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,440
community software supported directly by

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,839
our own people and relying on the

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,850
support from the community I think it's

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,550
a big change and I'm really proud of it

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,560
so it's quite cool and open-source

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,290
there's more benefits for us right yeah

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,550
for me it's really cool right to be able

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,110
to look at the code and the issue

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,839
trackers and be part of the community

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,940
you know from mailing list or slack it's

00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,810
like yeah it's prop open source which is

00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:32,160
super cool and of course being part of

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,570
the community means that we can

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,190
contribute back which we've done you

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,750
know many people across here and there

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,480
are open source projects they're all on

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:42,089
github if you want to check them out

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:45,029
yeah that's good so the whole journey

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:47,280
has learned us a lot and made loads of

00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:50,880
mistakes I mentioned a few but there

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,790
trust me they're more the biggest I

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,040
think takeaway is

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:59,120
everything revolves around trust we

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,889
couldn't have done this I think if we

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,010
hadn't put the trust and the power in

00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:05,270
the hands of the engineers so I think

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,589
it's really important that you start to

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,429
build trust first before you start

00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:12,470
building systems and just from a

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,049
grassroots movement you can you can

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:18,380
basically change the way the development

00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:19,699
and operations works together and I

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,309
think if you get all of these things

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:26,150
right you can really go from weeks to

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:27,949
minutes instead of having the horrible

00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,650
big monoliths that's deployed maybe once

00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:32,659
every twice once week you know with lots

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,960
of local optimization and snowflakes all

00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:37,630
over the place you can have nice into

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,640
something that's more appropriate for

00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,330
2016 lots of small apps deployed all the

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,159
time

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,289
global standards so it doesn't matter if

00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:47,390
you in Pune or New York alone on the

00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:50,059
Berlin you develop and deploy exactly

00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,130
the same you can do it all from a

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:54,679
grassroots movement so at no point in

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,630
time did any CEO or CTO come from us

00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,820
because they read something some cool

00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,190
pamphlet in CTO weekly or whatever we

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,669
did this from the ground up truly which

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,380
is pretty nice yeah so to give a a

00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,450
little bit of an impression what it's

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,789
like today if you have an idea you want

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,130
to go into into production where would I

00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:15,620
start with my idea what's a code write

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,390
some code and I did some work I think I

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:22,190
need a VM right well you just like to

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:24,770
push all right maybe I need some DNS all

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,900
right no that's handled by the platform

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,490
all right they'll request it'll but I

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,950
definitely need some storage rights a

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,539
manifest from my state sure but if you

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,190
stop relying on an affair you will have

00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:35,720
a much better time let's use object

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:39,080
storage or database or whatever make

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,270
sense okay that's cool but I want my app

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,640
to be available so there's probably some

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,409
firewall involved no you just bind your

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,350
application to a specific domain your

00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:50,090
online on the influence it's cool that's

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,350
awesome if you use a lot of

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,890
configuration management to get this

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:58,159
done or not really none it just works

00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,289
you know cool so this is great right I

00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,330
have my app I did didn't need anyone I

00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:04,370
was live but now I need to scale it so

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,580
now we're probably in trouble right -

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,640
see if scale

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,040
so if you don't have our Soviet spy okay

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:14,490
that's awesome and if we have more

00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:17,540
hardware you just go we rush you don't

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:20,630
we audit and push the bottle and

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,310
aggressive I would say that's pretty

00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:28,410
badass

00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:30,240
yeah so yeah that's our story how we

00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:37,590
went from weeks to minutes thank you all

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:40,050
for listening I want to thank my wife

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,630
for the slides he's probably watching at

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:46,219
home so thank you

00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,219
