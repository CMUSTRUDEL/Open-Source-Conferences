Title: Cloud Foundry: The Gaps - John Wetherill, BNY Mellon
Publication date: 2016-05-29
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Santa Clara 2016
Description: 
	BNY Mellon, the oldest bank in the US and one of the most influential financial institutions in the world, has made a firm commitment to Cloud Foundry as a key component of our cloud technology stack. The reasoning is clear: we are a financial institution focusing on financial problems, and don't want to be in business of building infrastructure and platform software, instead wanting to take advantage of open-source community-driven software so we can focus on our business challenges. 

Cloud Foundry meets several of our requirements for a highly-available, flexible, secure, and scalable platform , but it's not a panacea and has some gaps that we are forced to fill using other technologies. Specifically these gaps include support for non-http workloads, service discovery, multi-datacenter orchestration and failover support, application grouping (assembly) concepts, OS support, and more. 

This technical session will focus on many of these gaps that the open source Cloud Foundry platform currently doesn't cover, and will present in depth the solutions, including other open source software technologies, that we are building to fill those gaps, to deliver a flexible and reliable platform that fosters modern cloud practices including microservices, containerization, and continuous delivery. 

Developers, DevOps, sys-admins, and IT decision makers in any industry will benefit from the lessons we've learned.
