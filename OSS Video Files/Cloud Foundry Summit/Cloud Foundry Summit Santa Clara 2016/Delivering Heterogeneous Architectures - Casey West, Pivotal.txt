Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Santa Clara 2016
Description: 
	Middleware lock-in is over. In a world of lightweight, containerized workloads the need to standardize on a commong middleware is no more. With Cloud Foundry's buildpack ecosystem the need to manage middleware yourself is further nonexistant. This is truly exciting as is eliminates the operational overhead of using the right tool for the right job. Cloud Foundry, with officially supported and open source buildpacks, supports more than 50 programming languages, frameworks, an runtime environments. This rich ecosystem empowers your engineers to explore new tools and environments without burdening your operators with the need to learn, manage, and maintain new runtime environments. 

What even is a buildpack? How are they managed? How are they used? How do I make my own? In this talk we'll answer all those questions. 

We'll dissect a buildpack and examine its internals. Learn how Cloud Foundry builds containers for your applications in its staging environment. Learn how operators deploy, enable, and upgrade buildpacks. we'll expore the separation of responsibility Cloud Foundry offers to empower operations to control the runtime environmnents carefully whilst providing maximum flexibility to engineering safely. Learn how to specify buildpacks when deploying applications, and how to manage runtime upgrades and security fixes with minimal developer disruption. Finally, learn how to write a custom buildpack for specialized runtime environments. 

Cloud Foundry will run almost any cloud-native application in almost any runtime environment. We may never support COBOL, but after this talk you'll see how Cloud Foundry support's the rest of your heterogeneous architecture.
