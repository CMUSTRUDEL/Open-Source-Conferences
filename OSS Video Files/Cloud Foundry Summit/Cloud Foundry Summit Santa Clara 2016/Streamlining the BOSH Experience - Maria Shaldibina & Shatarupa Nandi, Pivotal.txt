Title: Streamlining the BOSH Experience - Maria Shaldibina & Shatarupa Nandi, Pivotal
Publication date: 2016-05-29
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Santa Clara 2016
Description: 
	BOSH has proven to be a go-to tool for managing Cloud Foundry and other complex service installations. But when infrastructure grows and number of deployments increases significantly new challenges arise: how easy is it to configure each deployment and connect them together, or how can deployment operators quickly understand requirements specified by software they are deploying. BOSH has made lots of progress in the past year to solve challenges of large multi-deployment installations. 

In this talk core BOSH contributors will introduce recently released BOSH features and improvements with the aim of lowering the barrier to entry to deploying software with BOSH. Service broker authors, distributed software developers, release and operations engineers will be provided with new tools to compose and share cluster topologies. 

Maria and Rupa will also talk about the development process: driving features with a comprehensive test suite (including fuzz and load tests), overcoming friction in a well-established open-source codebase, extending functionality while maintaining backwards compatibility and enabling recovery from misconfigurations while migrating to new functionality. 

Shatarupa Nandi

Rupa is a consultant at Pivotal Labs. Rupa has developed various data services running on CF (such as Pivotal Hadoop for PCF, Pivotal Gemfire for PCF and others) and is currently a developer on the BOSH team. Rupa enjoys using CF to build distributed data services and exploring problems involving persistence, networking and service discovery in the cloud.

Maria Shaldibina
