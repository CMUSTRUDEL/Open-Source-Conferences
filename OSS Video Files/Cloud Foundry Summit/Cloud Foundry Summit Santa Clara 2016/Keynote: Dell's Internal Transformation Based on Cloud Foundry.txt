welcome to Cloud Foundry summit thank

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,760
you for having this thank you for being

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,019
a sponsor so you're new to the community

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,179
but I thought it would be a good

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,679
opportunity for everyone here to hear a

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,650
little bit about what Dells been working

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,260
on one of the most fascinating things

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,789
that I learned last week is the

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,580
transformation journey that Dells been

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,380
going on internally so Cody maybe you

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,849
can tell us a little bit about the agile

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,380
transformation initiative and the

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,910
journey that Dells been going on and how

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,780
Cloud Foundry has played a part in that

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,500
sure so we we started an initiative a

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,750
couple of years ago to focus on our

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,750
deployment process to focus on our

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,670
end-to-end delivery cycle what their

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,250
applications there are a lot of a lot of

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,829
areas that needed needed improvement we

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,129
started with the process side of the you

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,960
know side of the equation where they we

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,340
started structuring the teams looking at

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,059
the teams thinking about being more

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,790
agile we we had some structural changes

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,799
within the within the teams we let's

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,720
start looking at colocation we started

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,790
doing all of these these agile like

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,270
themes that you know you read about or

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,580
maybe you've already done what we

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,770
learned is you know as you start doing

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,619
that especially in an organization as

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,580
large as ours where we have you know we

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,799
have around 2,500 applications we have

00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,110
thousands of developers some of these

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,470
applications are legacy been out there

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,850
for 20 years some of them are brand new

00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,090
that we learned that there's really not

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,869
a you know a silver bullet or a single

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,869
solution that that would work that would

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,250
apply to all of these different teams so

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,250
last year started developing some

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,570
capabilities targeted at specific parts

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,189
of the the delivery cycle so we for

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,439
example we started looking at making

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,880
sure we had consistent build build

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,659
automation in place for each of our

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,829
applications we started looking at

00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:08,340
automation around provisioning of our

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,860
entire servers and our infrastructure we

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,540
looked at it a lot of test automation we

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,440
built frameworks around the functional

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,370
regression in

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,620
and test automation we also looked at

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,070
deployment automation and we had a lot

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,960
of successes there the problem is that

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,790
these were all individual capabilities

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,250
and we really didn't have an indian

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,470
solution so even though we did have

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,540
improvements for example in one space we

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,170
had we reduced their deployment time by

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,050
284 percent so you know that was a big

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,020
win for them however it was limited up

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,890
to from dev to to our staging

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,120
environments that didn't include

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:50,700
production so we started looking at you

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,920
know how how can we help can we complete

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,820
this fixture and the mentality we had

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,740
was well we're gonna build these

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,930
capabilities and we're going to

00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,670
accommodate whatever applications need

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,770
they come to us with their requirements

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,510
we will make sure that that we

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,360
accommodate you know their their

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,250
technical technical needs you know

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,810
whether it's dependent you know specific

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,990
infrastructure needs whether it's

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,120
middleware needs whatever it is and we

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,060
again we made some progress there well

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,810
now we were to the point to where

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,310
realizing that that isn't really

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,870
scalable especially wouldn't talk about

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,209
the you know again the size of the

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,940
organization that we have so we started

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,340
looking at we we we met with pivotal we

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,590
started looking at cloud foundry cloud

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,350
foundry had a lot of capabilities within

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,530
it that we're missing in our current

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,340
solution for example Bluegreen

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,320
deployments or zero downtime deployments

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,360
one of the biggest ones was environment

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,519
parity you know so now you have your

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,230
your dev environment your integration

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,810
environment your production environments

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,940
all looking the same so what you know in

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,620
the previous earlier presentation you

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,840
know it worked in dev well not in

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,190
production well this is this is one of

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,500
the issues that we had that we were

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,170
trying to solve so we brought in you

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,310
know so we starting the gauge amount hit

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,930
start having the discussions around

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,739
December of last year we kicked off a

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,800
formal formal dojo a couple of months

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,049
ago lasted six weeks during that dojo we

00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:20,850
were able to deploy three different

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:22,289
foundations we deployed them let's talk

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,690
about the implementation I think we have

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,850
this slide to show

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,380
to show what you've implemented which i

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,150
think is let's talk a little bit about

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,700
the foundations you've deployed and on

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:37,950
the different infrastructures I think we

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,600
have a slide well while we're waiting

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,580
for that I think one of the the key

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,650
things to point out is while we did work

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,150
and are we are working with pivotal on

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,460
the implementation we're not working

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,020
with a commercial distro so this is an

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,820
open-source version that that were

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,150
working with and have opted to to go

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,950
with interesting absolutely so what

00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,150
we've done what you see is a it's a

00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:03,120
high-level view on purpose but we wanted

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,370
we wanted something that we wanted to

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,630
prove in this pilot or in this dojo that

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,540
we could have you know flexibility in in

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,980
the infrastructure that we worked on

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,230
flexibility in the types of applications

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,710
that that we wanted hosted in this

00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,690
platform and so we we started with

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,390
building we built three foundations two

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,720
of them on a juror one prod one non prod

00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:30,630
I'm sorry on vSphere one prod before non

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,320
prod we built on as your instance out on

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,060
on the public public cloud and we've got

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,400
a variety of different applications that

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,870
would deploy to these clouds so we had

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,640
some net applications some java

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,380
applications some applications that were

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,350
new some applications that existed for

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,500
years so we completed a six-week dojo on

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:52,260
the we had an executive summary of that

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,630
review of that last week it was very

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,370
positive we're now putting together plan

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,110
moving forward we have inception

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:02,160
starting next week so we're very excited

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:06,360
about this good solution and so just a

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,120
quick question on you chose both on prim

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,370
and public cloud was that purposeful it

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,620
is again we just wanted some some

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,630
flexibility there there there are some

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,150
instances where obviously we want to

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,800
keep it on prim maybe number of

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,419
dependencies that we have calls back and

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,400
forth there are some applications as a

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,540
very lightweight very independent you

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,840
know it's not worth the cost of us

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,550
maintaining it so so we again we wanted

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,650
the flexibility we'll be rolling up that

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,720
plan you know here in the next couple of

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,350
months to to have a plan for our entire

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,860
application set

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,970
we have that's exciting so as Dells

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,280
gotten to go undergone this

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,440
transformation and and you're deploying

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,480
Cloud Foundry and moving workloads to it

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,640
how has this changed the way your

00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,330
organization thinks about technology and

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,550
how is this extended to both hiring and

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:58,380
recruiting and really the teams you've

00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:02,110
built around this so internally you know

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,540
this this platform is a it's an

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,510
opinionated platform right it requires

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,950
specific themes from your application

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:13,390
but I had before and what we have now

00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:17,980
are like 2,500 opinionated applications

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:20,830
and we have you know since they've today

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,380
the development teams are are required

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,690
to manage their applications you know in

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,340
especially when issues come up you know

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,760
troubleshooting deployment issues

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:34,170
troubleshooting configuration then now

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:40,960
we have thousands of opinionated people

00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:43,030
so so so what this this platform bring

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,190
is you know it is requiring

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,140
you know some consistency and some

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,540
standardization of our applications and

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,760
it's the way that dev thinks about it is

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,140
slightly different now now dev can focus

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,970
on development they're not having to

00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:59,440
focus on the platform so that's

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,410
internally that's that's one of the

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,830
biggest changes as far as you know

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:08,560
hiring and retaining talent you know I'm

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,810
involved in some some HR recruiting

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,620
efforts every year and been doing it for

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:17,410
several years now in the spring semester

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,000
and even in the last fall we're starting

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,400
to talk to some college you know some

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,280
some candidates that are starting to ask

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,720
us about cloud technologies and they're

00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,970
you know they're we have some

00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,890
opinionated you know college students

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:33,460
but but more importantly they're looking

00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:35,500
at you know to jump on the latest

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,300
technology to jump on you know some of

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,880
these things that are exciting and

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:43,510
forward-thinking like cloud foundry like

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,190
cloud foundry so you know just just you

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,230
know just by the definition of what it

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,130
is just from how how we're implementing

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,620
it how we're selling it to

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,660
internally to our customers how were how

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,490
we're advertising it with with our

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,560
recruits is definitely changing the

00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,779
talent in the dynamics of the

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,970
organization I would also say that why

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:04,459
it helps us to recruit you've also got

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,899
the existing people who are there and so

00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:07,519
you're always going to have your chroma

00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,680
genes who are not going to get into it

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,230
but then you've got this the stack of

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,329
people who were chomping at the bit to

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,310
do something really exciting and really

00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:18,170
new and those are the people who whose

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,089
passion gets ignited by something like

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,529
this they see okay we're going to

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,209
something more modern we're going to

00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,800
something that that I've always wanted

00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:26,569
to try out and I say I think it really

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,050
helps to motivate and retain those

00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:31,670
people as well absolutely and I think

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,029
this is probably something everyone here

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:37,519
is thinking about today as well on that

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:40,160
point and I think this is really kind of

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,779
a great theme that's been throughout the

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,889
week around transformation is how has

00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,079
this changed the way you think about

00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:47,690
your customers and the challenges that

00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,310
your customers are undergoing I think

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,380
one thing is it's given us both

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,709
experience and empathy for what they're

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,329
going through so we can understand

00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:58,220
theoretically about when we come to

00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:00,170
preach digital transformation but if we

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,209
ourselves have gone through it we have a

00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,189
much more realistic understanding of

00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:06,380
what it's about and I think the way to

00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:08,810
look at it is digital transformation is

00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,670
not waterfall I think what Cody was

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,529
talking about is we've had a bunch of

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,630
different efforts and that's not just

00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:17,420
because we're disorganized or maybe we

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:20,269
are but that's a different subject by

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,009
having these different initiatives that

00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:24,860
you're doing that allows you to move

00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,839
more quickly so same thing with as we

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,670
work with our Cloud Foundry

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,620
implementation it's not a let's let's

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,509
clear the decks let's go whole hog on

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,240
this it's let's complete a six month

00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:36,740
that's our six-week dojo and also rather

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,079
than looking at well let's refactor

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,630
everything we have and start from from

00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,160
scratch it's a reap lat forming to begin

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,889
with now of course we would love to get

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,930
to where we're naturally writing in

00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:50,959
micro services and deploying that way

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,730
but it's very much a step-by-step

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,290
process and that's one thing that it

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,470
helps us to understand when we go to our

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:59,850
customers that it isn't a binary switch

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,190
over to to the new digital world it

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,600
it's coming in it's helping to to

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,340
address these cultural issues and

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,040
getting people started getting people

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:11,790
iterating which is such an exciting time

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,420
and as I think we're all aware 2016 is

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:17,640
going to be an amazing year for Dell

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,290
from your perspective given all the

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,380
caveats with what is public and what's

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,780
not what is the vision for Dell

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,370
technologies taken into all these

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,560
considerations the transformation

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,410
journey Cloud Foundry your vision for

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,240
the future what does that look like and

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,310
what do you see or do you see Dell going

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,840
for the future well I think and you lose

00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,250
it to Dell technologies or your name

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,320
Dell technologists which will be the

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,160
name of the the organization when when

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,200
the the acquisition / merger closes but

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,570
I think what it does is it provides us a

00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,640
continuum of services and corporate

00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,810
companies that we can use to better

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,750
serve our customers

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,820
so whereas Dell ourselves as Cody's

00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,890
talking about we may be back here a

00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,720
little bit further more more like our

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:03,960
traditional customer base we're now

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,620
acquiring capability to say through

00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,810
VMware through pivotal that helped to

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,270
put us out on the on the much more thei

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,070
leading edge and so by taking that

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,810
information we can then stream it back

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,270
and provide it to some people who are

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,880
who are closer to where we are and maybe

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:23,840
this sort of customer base that EMC also

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,040
serves as well so it gives just a better

00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,230
breadth of understanding and of

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,200
viewpoints and then allowing that to to

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,600
come back and help folks maybe a little

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,980
bit further back in the chain well your

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,820
portfolio is certainly going to be

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,400
amazing

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,230
following the acquisition and with the

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,360
journey that you're on I'm excited to

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,810
see where Dell is going to go in 2016

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,340
me too so with that and with time left

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,890
because I know we're the last one in the

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:53,280
evening Nick I think we will turn this

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:56,330
back over to you and let everyone get on

00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,330
to happy hours

00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,980
