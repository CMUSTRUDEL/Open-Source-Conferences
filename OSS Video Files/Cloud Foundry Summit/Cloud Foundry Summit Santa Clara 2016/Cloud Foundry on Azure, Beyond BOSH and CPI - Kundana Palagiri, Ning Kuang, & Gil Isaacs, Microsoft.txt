let's get started hi again thank you for

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,450
coming here today I realize we are

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,750
between you and your on the lunch so we

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:16,139
will try to get you all out but 1:30 so

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:20,070
today we are going to talk about beyond

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:23,160
Bosh and CPI so what that means is you

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,720
know basically Oh a journey for the last

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,689
one year so in May 2015 last year a

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,809
little over a year and I remember the

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,000
day because last year the summit was

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,610
right after Mother's Day weekend so I

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,930
travel the day so last year it was just

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:46,440
moving and me at the conference our CPI

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,289
was an early preview and we demoed it

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,890
and we're really glad to be back again

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:56,070
here this year and share our incredible

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,250
journey the last one year releasing the

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:03,809
services running customers in production

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:07,650
and building a Microsoft cloud foundry

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:10,020
community within Microsoft so our goal

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,060
today is to share our experience and a

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:18,689
journey I think if you don't mind

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:20,640
intense light next please about us who

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,380
are we as I mentioned right we have a

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,630
small cloud foundry community within

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,320
Microsoft there are few folks here in

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,369
the room as well

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,930
in addition to us I'm a program manager

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:33,030
primarily working on as your past

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,240
services as your first party past

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,369
services and open source / open source

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,420
path service integration as well and

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:45,420
with me is Gil Gil is a partner

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,590
architect who primarily focuses on is v

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,960
onboarding and we have link who heads

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,659
the team who is a program manager for

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,579
cloud foundry project and she works in

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,040
the open source team so this is just a

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:05,130
small team the rest of us are you can

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:07,259
find us in the booth so today in the 30

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,050
minutes we want to walk away with these

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,970
three takeaways cloud foundry plus a

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,569
short so we'll spend a few minutes

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,000
talking about the

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:20,170
why and the how then we want to show you

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,480
how you can easily get started with a

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:26,769
click of a button deploy cloud foundry

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,590
on assured and finally we just announced

00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,840
the a short service brokers these are

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:36,689
service brokers for a short first party

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:40,930
services and Ning will do a demo of that

00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:43,090
thanks name so before we get started

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,909
right let's look at what is supported

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,430
today Claude 400 units your where are we

00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:51,010
what supported so number one is the open

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,250
source Cloud Foundry is generally

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,889
available today in addition pivotal

00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,859
Cloud Foundry is fully supported we also

00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:02,319
have a single quick mod template in our

00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:04,870
marketplace that auto that allows you to

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,840
deploy PC open as your with the click of

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,599
a button and just announced hard thing

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,459
is the service brokers so these are the

00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,709
things that are today's supported in

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:18,069
Azure

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:21,549
and if you go to the next line oh and

00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:24,370
one more thank you so just to quickly

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:26,290
give some highlights of cloud foundry

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,139
and as your in terms of what's supported

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,269
so you know a lot of questions customers

00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,949
a lot of folks ask us you know why do we

00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,500
support Cloud Foundry national what is

00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:38,109
the primary driver the number one reason

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,750
for us to work on Cloud Foundry is many

00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:43,000
of our customers have asked this so it's

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,729
frequently asked by our customers it's a

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,810
great option for running Java workloads

00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:53,590
on Azure in addition it's fully owned

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:56,530
and supported by Microsoft and it also

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,919
has it's backed by our executives so

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,629
it's actual executive commitment in

00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,909
addition we have a great joint

00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:05,680
engineering model with pivotal and now

00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:07,209
we know in the from recent news you

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,310
might have seen Microsoft is also

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,919
invested in Puritan success so load up

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,900
again in just one year you know this

00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:18,609
project picked up a lot of momentum and

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:21,220
a lot of cold highlights to share so a

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:23,740
lot of you know in in the next couple

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,010
three four slides I want to look I want

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,260
to give an overview of some

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,680
the most commonly asked questions and

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,350
try to summarize where we are so the

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,260
first question is where does the Cloud

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:40,740
Foundry fit in as your ecosystem so

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,570
adjure has a lot of past services so our

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,450
customers ask us where does it fit in

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:48,630
the ecosystem when to use what so this

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:51,720
this diagram is what we call the path

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:55,260
continuum this describes all of the path

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,170
services in Azure you know starting from

00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,660
the IR side to the past soil and in

00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,120
between and I'm not trying to cover all

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,040
of any of this in detail in except our

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,920
boundary but if you look at Cloud

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,890
Foundry Cloud Foundry sits at the same

00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,800
level as other first-party services it's

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,410
built on the same infrastructure like

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,690
the rest of the services and at the end

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,810
of the day we leave it to the customers

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:24,840
to choose the platform that's right for

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,030
their applications all right so this is

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,240
about Barrett with the second next

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,580
question that gets asked often is in

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,990
what regions can you deploy cloud

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,870
foundry and a short today

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,440
so if you go to the next line so if

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,020
you've seen as your regions so as Joe

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,360
today has been announced in 32 regions

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,780
so this is more than any other cloud

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,840
combined and out of beans 24 or

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,510
operational so this is a huge huge

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,060
investment serious stuff right so we are

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,490
making a big bet on this growing our

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,460
infrastructure

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:05,460
the goal for Azure is to be in all major

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:09,630
regions and we're a sure cannot be as

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,100
your stack will be there so I just

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,510
wanted to actually take a quick pause

00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,310
and ask a question that I wanted to ask

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,400
in the beginning but I forgot is how

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:22,260
many how many folks in the room use

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:29,190
Azure thank you this store doesn't count

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:30,660
it's all magazine okay a few of you so

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,390
for those of you who are not familiar

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,760
right so this is one of the strategic

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,710
investments where Azure is the

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,960
investment on growing all these as you

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,820
region's so close and so out of these

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,600
regions some of these are sovereign

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,210
clouds

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,430
for example as your China is an example

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,870
which is sovereign cloud Germany which

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,750
was pronounced it's also a sovereign

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,790
cloud so these are all the regions

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,580
there's another government cloud as well

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,010
so these are all the public cloud and

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:03,990
sovereign clouds where you could run

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:06,270
Cloud Foundry all right next one little

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,760
bit about the Bosch project so bashed

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,530
bashed CPI as everybody may know room

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,650
knows what CPI is so I will not talk

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,200
about it just like any other CPI for any

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:19,470
cloud actual version is also fully open

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,920
sourced we have a dedicated engineering

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,180
team that started small and it's growing

00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,500
it's aligned with the community

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,560
engineering practices we work very

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,360
closely with the community so if anybody

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,660
in the room has work with us on this

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,910
project many thanks to you and the most

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,550
important thing for us is the whole CPI

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:41,520
the whole rack it's designed to work

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,560
both in a short public cloud on the

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,600
azure stack which is an on-prem data

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,240
center so when plot 400 when it becomes

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,960
available our goal is to make it easy to

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,850
deploy cloud foundry in Azure stack so

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,100
yeah and we have a committed roadmap

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,200
some of it will share today if you want

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,150
what's coming in the pipeline please

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:05,430
feel free to stop by our booth next line

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,980
yeah so the last another question that

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,110
we get often is you know this is a new

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,510
service go on in production just like

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,360
any other services how ready is it for

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,190
enterprise workloads so you know today

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,260
with cloud forward in the last one year

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,570
by you know by working with customers we

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,040
have actually exercised many enterprise

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,930
scenarios and these are some of the

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,600
examples so you can take Cloud Foundry

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,110
and do an active-active configuration or

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,630
a multi

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,180
deployment you know this is just a

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,460
topology I put there you know things

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,160
like securing your deployments isolating

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,770
them so most of the enterprise scenarios

00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,010
are supported today and many of them are

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,650
in the roadmap all right so with that

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,300
high-level overview I'm going to give it

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:55,200
to deal to talk about

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:56,280
pivotal Cloud Foundry all right I'm

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,500
gonna pay attention to where the

00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:05,340
boundary is on the stage okay thanks

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:09,060
candana and as candana mentioned I'm a

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:12,180
sure architect I work exclusively with

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,670
ISV partners who are onboarding on to

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,390
Azure and enabling their solutions on

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:21,120
Azure over the past six eight months my

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,800
life has become almost exclusively cloud

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,290
foundry and pivotal cloud foundry and we

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,020
were working very closely and this is

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:31,770
just some examples of the work that we

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,050
have done over the past few months is a

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,810
picture of a hack fest we had where we

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,070
brought together a group of people who

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,320
were just getting started within

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,100
Microsoft on various projects around

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,530
Cloud Foundry we brought them out into

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,330
Redmond we had some pivotal folks who

00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,730
were doing some training with us and

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,980
then we did some of our own projects and

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,640
out of this we have a growing community

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,170
we have I think our we have anybody uses

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,090
Yammer we have an internal Yammer group

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,300
it's got almost 100 folks on it and

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:06,420
words actively working together and

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,270
supporting each other you may have seen

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,040
the Ford project announcement so a lot

00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,520
of us worked on that either in one way

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,310
or another

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,400
behind the scenes helping each other and

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,200
in addition you may have seen around the

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,690
time of the Ford announcement that we

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,430
brought to market a marketplace offer

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,290
which I'm going to talk about in a

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,660
second which allows you to single click

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:31,250
out of the marketplace and deploy a test

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:34,800
environment in Azure we're also working

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,720
side by side with pivotal engineers we

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,090
have a juror engineers who are going to

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,330
be spending time with pivotal directly

00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,330
and

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,950
we're also advising on architecture with

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,260
our customer advisory team and you know

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,760
again starting with candana and Ming's

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,810
work which we're all very lucky that

00:10:51,760 --> 00:11:01,990
they started we're fully supported on

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:04,840
Azure so how can you deploy Cloud

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,520
Foundry with one-click I like to think

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,160
of this part of our presentation there's

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,890
easy ways for you to get started even if

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,960
you I saw we had I'm gonna just call it

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,390
20% in the audience who have played

00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,310
around with Azure these couple of slides

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,990
I threw some links in here and these

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,750
this content will be available to

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,610
everybody after the summit but it's

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,770
super easy to get started with Azure and

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,920
it's super easy to single click and get

00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:34,630
started with Cloud Foundry on Azure so a

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:37,750
fundamental basic foundation of this is

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:40,660
the azure resource manager and that is

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:43,360
essentially the API for everything that

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,670
happens within a sure and it not only is

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,640
the API but it includes a really an easy

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:50,860
template driven way to create things in

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,270
Azure so you can build a JSON template

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,150
you send it to the Azure resource

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,730
manager and you get stuff it's all

00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,260
related so I'll pre-configured we

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,610
actually have an extensive library I'm

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,050
going to show these in just a second but

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,860
we have an extensive library of

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:09,930
pre-built templates to construct a lot

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:13,290
of common use cases with in Azure and

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:18,190
the open source Cloud Foundry the first

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:20,710
release that came out last year the Bosh

00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,250
components and the initial networking is

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,510
all based on a pre-configured Azure

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,510
template which you can go to and you can

00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,100
look at that

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:33,040
so again resource manager is

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:37,660
foundational to this from there you you

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:41,680
use arm and then we have now built a

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:43,300
marketplace so a lot of popular software

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,000
solutions that you may be familiar with

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,589
may be used to using in the cloud are

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,900
available in the marketplace from a

00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:55,209
single click and based on that we built

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,629
the PCF on Azure

00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:00,429
offering and additionally if you get

00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:02,949
into trouble we've done a really nice

00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:05,139
job in partnership with pivotal writing

00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:13,439
a deployment guide so let's take a quick

00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:13,439
look at these where is the browser

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:30,450
okay so first starters oh it's on the

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:35,860
needs to be moved over to here alright

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:39,519
okay now I can't see the screen can we

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:43,779
make it a single screen all right I'll

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,339
just improvise so you don't usually hear

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:47,200
people talking about documentation as

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:48,519
being very exciting but if you haven't

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,399
looked at any of the Microsoft sites

00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,470
lately we've put a tremendous amount of

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,959
investment into the documentation

00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,149
there's a lot of great examples as

00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,490
tutorials there's getting started guides

00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:01,899
and there's really tremendous detail

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,410
about how to do things this is just the

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:07,420
example of the resource manager

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:10,950
documentation landing page and it's

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:16,269
really quite extensive so based on this

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:19,329
where's the mouse okay we over the sense

00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:21,880
resource manager has come out and this

00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:23,470
is something that Microsoft is really

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,990
doing a heck of a lot of work on

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,930
internally and with the community is we

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,730
built this library and it's you can see

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,079
it's on github anybody can look at this

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:36,130
anybody can contribute and participate

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:39,519
of quite a lot of common use cases of

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:44,860
pre-configured solutions that you can

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,000
deploy right on to Azure and again you

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,459
may have seen this at some of the

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,890
previous presentations but this is our G

00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:53,440
a guidance for Bosch and cloud foundry

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,149
on Azure so again you'll see there's a

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,010
resource template in here and then from

00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:59,500
the resource template and though your

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,180
your Deb jump box is created and then

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,769
you can go right in and launch

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,350
deployment scripts just like you would

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:11,110
on any Cloud Foundry and this is the

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:13,810
marketplace so let's see what that

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,670
number there it's now 3,700 and growing

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,899
and a lot of my colleagues are actively

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:21,519
working with names you would all

00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:23,320
recognize in fact actually I think this

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,880
was yesterday we just made a really nice

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,769
announcement with Jenkins so there's

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,079
Jenkins integration so we're working

00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:30,699
really closely with them so just to give

00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:32,110
you an example if you look for any of

00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:33,370
your favorite solution sitting here

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,800
you're likely to find them

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,800
if I go in here and search for pivotal

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:45,460
hopefully I typed it correctly all right

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:51,100
and there is the offer so if I select

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:53,830
that how do you have time okay good

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,660
I can single click right into here and

00:15:53,830 --> 00:16:00,730
it's going to launch so let's just take

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:02,350
a quick look at what that does for us so

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,210
that deploy button and actually if you

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,130
look at the Quick Start library that I

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,890
showed in github every single one of

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:11,440
those templates also has a deploy button

00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:15,100
and what the deploy button does is it

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,580
just takes the template starts the azure

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,040
portal and takes you right to a launch

00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,590
page with the template now when you do a

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,600
marketplace offering you you the quick

00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:31,620
launch goes to the partners launch page

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,490
and you can see there's extensive

00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,200
description and it's it's really pretty

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,470
much what was on the marketplace landing

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,030
page also is in here and I'll show this

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,310
at the end but this way only at the

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:47,460
bottom the deployment guide is here as

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,460
well so if we which I didn't

00:16:50,760 --> 00:17:05,620
that's the deployment guide okay but if

00:16:53,830 --> 00:17:07,540
I click on create alright we had we were

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,550
using several people's laptops so we

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,970
have different logins so what you would

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:14,740
see if I had the correct login here is

00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,330
there's an entry screen there's a few

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,490
fields that you need to enter so that

00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:22,330
Bosch has the right credentials in order

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:24,430
to create things in Azure and then also

00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,470
this is a commercial offering so you do

00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,280
need a pivot token but it is a 90 day

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:33,460
free trial and then that would start to

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:37,720
launch the entire Cloud Foundry now this

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:40,360
is a pre set size that's meant for pocs

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,900
and testing but it's again you enter

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,400
your secure credentials hit click and

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,990
you're off to the races

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,550
and so again if

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:53,470
doing that this is okay this guide will

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,080
help you all if you hit something that's

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,700
an issue this guy do this is probably in

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,860
here okay we've done a pretty a lot of

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,420
people have battle-tested this just to

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,990
make sure we have all the appropriate

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:13,090
guidance in here so let's go back to

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:15,010
PowerPoint yet expands to somewhere like

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,050
50 I think the actual numbers in the

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,450
deployment guide Donna but it's

00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,520
something like 50 60 VMs as it you know

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,620
Cloud Foundry has a lot of worker roles

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,200
and then it settles down to like 30 35

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,770
and that's when the audience yeah and

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,800
that's all automated it's just you know

00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:40,240
runs and so if you have entered all of

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:45,040
yours we'll get back to here you will

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:48,520
see all of your VMs running once you've

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,179
launched so this is just a screenshot of

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:54,970
a running Cloud Foundry that has several

00:18:51,179 --> 00:19:01,960
VMs so with that

00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:03,730
/ - minguk we're we're kind of

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,340
optimizing it all the time the last

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:09,580
thing i've seen was somewhere in the

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,410
hour so time frame of course you know

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,530
any cloud foundry that you would launch

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,450
that is gonna depend on how many you

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:21,820
know how big you make it right this is

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:26,740
like we said about 30 to 50 VMs okay so

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:30,429
onto service brokers thank you

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:33,820
so we are the engineering team for a

00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:37,059
sure open-source and in the past two

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:40,900
years our major focus is cloud foundry

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:43,570
and enable cloud foundry adjure and we

00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,980
work closely with the community with our

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:50,169
customers and has

00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:54,460
seeing an incredible journey here you

00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:58,450
can adjust as Donna mentioned CPI is the

00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,150
first project we work on with that that

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:05,470
is the first interface we have between

00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:07,600
Cloud Foundry and Azure and we we have a

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,990
preview last year about the same time

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:15,490
for the summit and the end of last year

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:18,280
we finally announced the GA and CPI is

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:21,520
just the first step beyond that actually

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,309
there are a lot of more components in

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,190
Azure that can contribute to the

00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:29,950
ecosystem of Cloud Foundry and from this

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,860
graph you can see for the infrastructure

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:36,490
of Cloud Foundry and at different level

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:40,120
we have component in anger that our

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:42,669
customer is interested and asking us to

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,429
integrate and contribute to clock on J

00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:49,179
component for example the application

00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:53,559
gateway for routing and load balancing

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:59,070
for a generic added active directory for

00:20:53,559 --> 00:21:02,770
authentication block storage and service

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:05,530
service brokers and then our Microsoft

00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:08,799
operation manager suite for monitoring

00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:12,400
and logging so today I'm going to focus

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,400
on service brokers because as Gil and

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,169
Kadena I just mentioned we just released

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:24,580
the public preview of our first batch of

00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:27,640
service brokers last week hiccup quick

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:30,780
look here here is um here are the five

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,600
service brokers the azure blob storage

00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:37,900
event have service pass radius and

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:42,580
document DB these at the top on the top

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:45,850
list customer is always asking and you

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:48,309
can also see later I'll show the UI we

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:52,059
have a simple and consistent interface

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:54,340
so whatever you are comfortable today to

00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:57,220
develop for service brokers and your

00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:01,059
existing platform it's consistent

00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:04,510
you can use the same way to to configure

00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:07,480
it and to use it we call it metal

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:10,150
service broker what this does is we have

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,490
one single service broker interface

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:15,580
you only need to install and configure

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:18,280
one service broker and after that all

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,260
the services the five services is

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:24,100
included in this package

00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:26,650
we just need to enable it and this is

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:30,850
totally open source so it's open to

00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:37,780
community to contribute and adding

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:40,240
feedbacks for different roles for Cloud

00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:43,720
Foundry for service broker we have

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,780
different guidance for admins we have we

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,990
have guidance guide you through the

00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:52,870
process of creating service finding

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:55,929
services and for developers we just need

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:58,539
to all you need to do is to utilize the

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:01,090
environment variables to access the

00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:04,390
service incidences and then for

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:07,510
contributors and we have guidance on how

00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:10,330
you can write your own service brokers -

00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:13,409
if you like any address services you can

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:19,350
use the same way to add to our package

00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:19,350
so next I'm going to take a look

00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:36,570
so this is where our service broker in

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:41,420
github and we have the system and a

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:45,060
service broker here's the overview and

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:48,450
the guidance for admin and guidance for

00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:51,240
each individual services the service bus

00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:57,030
and the event hub in same service and

00:23:51,240 --> 00:24:00,000
then the contributors guidance okay so

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:03,570
um the next I'm going to walk through

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,290
the step how an admin can deploy and

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:13,200
utilize a service broker here I already

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:16,650
have a Cloud Foundry deployment and with

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,140
that I just install our mater service

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,540
broker as application to this Cloud

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,900
Foundry deployment and right now since

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:28,500
this is a PCF deployment you can see if

00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:31,800
I check this marketplace that these are

00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,620
the default service brokers that is

00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:38,370
taught and that does not have any agile

00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:43,310
services yet so what I'm going to do is

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:43,310
I'm going to first create a service

00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,240
okay let me double-check that

00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:21,890
okay so I seem to me the service broker

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:24,260
is currently crated this is the matter

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:27,470
service broker I just mentioned which is

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:30,590
appear to be a single service broker but

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:34,940
it contains all the services in order

00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:37,550
for you to access all the service order

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:42,580
services you need to enable them so

00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,580
enemies enable the service broker

00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,540
they're bad at pack

00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:15,900
I mean just yes a little bit bad of

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,900
typing

00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:32,509
okay so we enable the first service

00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:37,009
broker which is the flat storage let's

00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:39,639
enable the next one which is address

00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:39,639
service pass

00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:01,000
okay and let's enable remember agile

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:14,610
service bus high post service pass and

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:18,990
even law now enable the document DB and

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,990
finally the readiest service

00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:34,430
servus okay so all the five services is

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:42,380
now enabled what we can do is we can do

00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:47,090
a marketplace so from here if you look

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:50,090
at the marketplace you can see the azure

00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:52,660
service brokers are already here and

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:59,810
they are available for the developer to

00:27:52,660 --> 00:28:02,540
to use next the admin wanted to make a

00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:05,390
service instance so the the developer

00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:09,850
can take advantage of it so he first

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,850
need to create a service

00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:32,870
I'll specify the plan

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:47,110
okay my spelling is really bad

00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,000
okay so

00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:35,140
it's already created seem to me so in

00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:39,100
order to so the service is created in

00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:54,190
order for the application to use it you

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:58,720
need to actually you actually need to

00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:10,990
look at your applications so let's go to

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:23,410
our application and here so if you look

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:26,490
at your application you will find so all

00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:32,790
you need to do with your application is

00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:32,790
you can take advantage of the service

00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:43,500
the involvement environment variables we

00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:46,809
just created for you so here you can see

00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,450
that's the actual blog service and then

00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:51,760
if you have the services enabled and

00:30:49,450 --> 00:31:01,660
then you can access the environment

00:30:51,760 --> 00:31:06,450
variable so here what okay so finally

00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:06,450
let's take a quick look of this

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,769
[Music]

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:26,120
so this is the PCI app manager with the

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,120
plum font redeployment and you can see

00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:34,890
with the marketplace all the address

00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,710
service broker is now in a vault and you

00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:48,690
just need to run your application to

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:50,610
find it later okay thank you so we have

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,610
a couple of other sessions if you want

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:57,270
to learn more about a sure we have a

00:31:53,610 --> 00:32:00,450
session on dotnet and then we have also

00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:02,210
tomorrow a panel where you can come and

00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,400
ask some tough questions

00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:08,700
no because these guys are taking some

00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,170
starting the amount of questions but

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,710
hope to see you around in the booth it's

00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,220
not there

00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,460
thank you

00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,460
