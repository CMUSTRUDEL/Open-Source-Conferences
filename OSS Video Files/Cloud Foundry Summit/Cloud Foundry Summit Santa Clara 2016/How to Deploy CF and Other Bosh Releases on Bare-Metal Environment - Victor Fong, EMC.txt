Publication date: 2016-05-29
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Santa Clara 2016
Description: 
	For years, CF users have been asking for the functionality to deploy Cloud Foundry on bare metal machines. With the new RackHD CPI, Bosh is now empowered to provision bare-metal machines, deploy software on them, and monitor the health of deployments. 

The RackHD CPI bridges the communication between Bosh (http://bosh.io) and EMC OSS RackHD (http://github.com/RackHD). RackHD is a technology stack that enables automated hardware management and orchestration. To Bosh, the RackHD CPI behaves just like any other Cloud Provider Interface. Internally, the RackHD CPI uses RackHD to manage, provision, and deploy software on bare machines.
