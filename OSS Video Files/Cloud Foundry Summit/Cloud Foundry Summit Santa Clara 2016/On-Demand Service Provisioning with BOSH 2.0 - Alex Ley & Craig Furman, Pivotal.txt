Title: On-Demand Service Provisioning with BOSH 2.0 - Alex Ley & Craig Furman, Pivotal
Publication date: 2016-05-29
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Santa Clara 2016
Description: 
	Alex & Craig have been busy building what they are calling “On-Demand Services”, leveraging new features arriving in BOSH 2.0. For the first time, app developers will have the ability to deploy dedicated resources by simply running `cf create-service`. For example, app developers could create a dedicated RabbitMQ cluster or a customised Redis instance for their application. 

You will be taken behind the scenes, showing how an app developer’s CF CLI request will trigger a service broker to create a new BOSH deployment which results in freshly created virtual machines. 

Finally, they will discuss and demonstrate what challenges on-demand services bring to operating the Cloud Foundry platform and exciting new user experiences that we could start to offer.
