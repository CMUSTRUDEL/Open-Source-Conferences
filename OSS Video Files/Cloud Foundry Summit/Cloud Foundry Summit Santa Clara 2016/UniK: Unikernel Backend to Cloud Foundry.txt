Title: UniK: Unikernel Backend to Cloud Foundry
Publication date: 2016-05-29
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Santa Clara 2016
Description: 
	Unikernel – an executable image that can run natively on a hypervisor without the need for a separate operating system – are rapidly gaining momentum. To integrate unikernels into the echo-system, cloud-computing platforms as a service are required to provide unikernels with the same services they provide for containers. Here we present Unik, an orchestration system for unikernels. Unik handles the compilation of libraries and applications for running on AWS, manages their scheduling, and ensures their health. To provide the user with a seamless PaaS experience, Unik is integrated as a backend to Cloud Foundry runtime. In the session we will cover: an overview of Unikernel, UniK and the integration with Cloud Foundry followed by a demo.
