Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Santa Clara 2016
Description: 
	Julian Fischer, CEO of anynines guides through the journey of building a highly available, self-provisioning PostgreSQL Cloud Foundry service. The talk is meant to share experience collected in the anynines team from years of building production grade backing services. PostgreSQL in particular is a good example as it has never been built to be fully automated. Challenges such as setting up a proper replication, detect failure scenarios and perform automatic failovers are interesting challenges with many pitfalls for beginners. Learn about production requirements, technical challenges and have a look at an exemplary architecture to learn about building failure resilient Cloud Foundry data services.
