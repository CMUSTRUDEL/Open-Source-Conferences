	Changing the Development Culture at Comcast and Our Evolution from Legacy SOA to Cloud Native - Nicholas Beenham and Todd Migliore, Comcast

The Enterprise Service Platform at Comcast processes over 200 million transactions per day, spanning the sales, ordering, provisioning, activation, billing, and payment domains. Join us to learn about how we changed the culture within our development teams and leveraged tools such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry and concepts such as TDD, continuous delivery and dev ops to reduce cycle times from months to hours. We will also discuss our ongoing evolution from legacy SOA to cloud native Microservices. This session will offer real world insight into some common challenges enterprises face as they migrate to the cloud and discuss strategies to overcome said challenges.
