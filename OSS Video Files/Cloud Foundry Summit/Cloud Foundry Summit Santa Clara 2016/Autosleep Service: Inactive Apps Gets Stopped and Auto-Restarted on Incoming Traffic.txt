	Autosleep Service: Inactive Apps Gets Stopped and Auto-Restarted on Incoming Traffic - Guillaume Berche, Orange

Did you ever run out of CloudFoundry cells capacity, while your Iaas budget is already maxed out ? Tired of asking org/space admins to clean up these hello-world apps that waste RAM on the platform ? 

The autosleep service might help: it automatically stops inactive apps and restarts them upon incoming traffic. 

Try it by yourself by installing it from https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/autosleep/ or come to this session to learn its motivations, get the current status of this work-in-progress, watch a demo, and understand how to autosleep service leverages cloudfoundry features (service broker api, route services, CC api) sometimes in unusual ways. This session wraps up with learnings and suggestions for potential evolution of the service broker API that could open up new innovative usages of the platform.
