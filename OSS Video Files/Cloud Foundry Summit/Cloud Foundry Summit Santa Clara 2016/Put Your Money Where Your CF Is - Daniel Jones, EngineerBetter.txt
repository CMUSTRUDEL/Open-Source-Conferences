Description: 
	Successfully introducing Cloud Foundry into a regulated financial enterprise is no mean feat, and managing four production Cloud Foundry instances in different data centres adds further complexity to be tamed. Daniel Jones relays his experiences operating Cloud Foundry at a global wealth management enterprise, covering both the technical and organisational challenges. How were enterprise developers upskilled in the ways of the cloud native app? What were the tensions between agility and regulatory requirements? What tooling helped administer multiple production CF instances? Can you declaratively configure the running state of a Cloud Foundry?
