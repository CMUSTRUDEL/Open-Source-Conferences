Description: 
	While Cloud Foundry is best suited for web applications and 12-factor apps, it also supports TCP traffic, making itself ready for e.g. IoT scenarios. But why not go further?

At Grape Up we experimented a bit with the CF platform and enabled it for UDP-based applications – first and foremost VoIP usecases. This lightning talk will show highlights of what we achieved and what new possibilities open for the Cloud Foundry platform.
