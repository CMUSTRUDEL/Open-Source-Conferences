Title: Cloud Foundry and Containers (or: Where does Cloud Foundry Fit in the Container Ecosystem?)
Publication date: 2016-05-29
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Santa Clara 2016
Description: 
	While some other platforms you may have heard of have containers front-and-center as the main user experience, Cloud Foundry uses containers under the covers to provide a rich user experience ("push my code, I don't care how"!). The container engine powering Cloud Foundry is called Garden and pre-dates most of the big name container technologies now in the market. In this talk, you'll find out what makes Garden different from other container technologies (including detailed comparisons of other container engines), and in what ways it's just the same.
