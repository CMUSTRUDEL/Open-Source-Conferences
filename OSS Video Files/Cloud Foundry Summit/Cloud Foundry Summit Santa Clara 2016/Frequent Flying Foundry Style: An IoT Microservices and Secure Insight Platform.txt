Description: 
	Frequent Flying Foundry Style: An IoT Microservices and Secure Insight Platform for the Aviation Industry - Sarah Cooper, M2Mi & Shyam Nath, GE Digital

The potential role of Internet of Things in next generation Airports and the broader Aviation Ecosystem is astounding. From reducing trip time to decreasing on-tarmac collisions, IoT’s enablement of shared real time resources and cross-ecosystem collaboration dramatically changes the value generation game in a traditionally siloed industry. The key to unlocking the cross-ecosystem potential is the creation of a secure, shared Aviation services platform that allows stakeholders to securely share insights without compromising data integrity and ownership. CloudFoundry is the perfect basis for such an industry shared resource. 

M2Mi and GE, along with several industry players are developing an Industrial IoT platform for Aviation based on the combination of M2Mi’s IoT platform and GE’s Predix platform on Cloud Foundry. This Aviation Shared IIoT Services platform serves as the basis for the Industrial Internet Consortium's Aviation Testbed and consists of aviation and airport control and data services with industry specific microservices for the real time management of cybersecurity, insight generation and private information sharing. We’ll walk through the architecture and Cloud Foundry components that are re-imagining air travel and aviation for the industry at large.

apologize for the slight delay Shaun

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:12,269
math from GE and I am Sarah Cooper I'm

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,849
the chief operating officer at m2m I

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,520
machine to machine intelligence we're

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:21,270
gonna walk through how the combination

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,820
of GE and m2 MI and some other partners

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,490
through an AIC testbed industrial

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,470
internet consortium testbed are using

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,160
cloud foundry and actually a couple of

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,590
different forms to build an

00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,480
industry-wide

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:40,230
platform for the aviation in Airport

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,640
industries there are an incredible

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,010
number of challenges as we all know in

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,570
airlines and airports not the least of

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,969
which is probably many of us are road

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,420
warriors I know a number of you here who

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,640
see it every conference and things have

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,440
actually keep getting worse despite the

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,320
fact that we are progressing through

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,449
time and civilization it now takes

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,360
longer to get from New York to

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,729
Washington DC it also takes about an

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,700
hour longer to get from LA to Newark and

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,140
that's because of a number of things

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,860
that are happening in airports today

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,759
there certainly a lot of legacy systems

00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:22,619
but frankly there's a very difficult

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,270
ecosystem in play and this is true not

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,840
just in aviation it's also true an

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,140
agribusiness it's true in oil and gas in

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,170
the airport space and aviation we have

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,880
everybody from the airlines they

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:41,009
contract with baggage cares and tarmac

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,399
carmack services and catering services

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,710
and there's the airport themselves often

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,880
they government agency and then you know

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,799
as you move from country to country

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,170
there are different vendors in each

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,030
Airport all of these guys have to get

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,439
together and be able to share

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,290
information in order to make sure that

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,270
your bag gets on the flight with you /

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:05,490
often very strict regulations so this is

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:10,080
just sort of a look at where in the

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,890
ecosystem there are interfaces and there

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,890
are a lot of them

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,290
there we go another interesting thing

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,030
about the airport ecosystem I'm kind of

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,100
walking through some of the challenges

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,500
so you understand why we need Cloud

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,210
Foundry and why we need to architect it

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,450
the way that we have

00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:37,840
I love the airport and an airline's

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,330
business model mainly because they have

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,370
continued to deliver a critical

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,010
infrastructure service to all of us with

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,690
some of the lowest margins I personally

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,960
have ever seen

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:52,870
4% net profit margin in 2015 that's

00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,180
globally across carriers it was a bit

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,430
higher in the US for North America it

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,040
was seven point six which is a banner

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,750
year that's actually above their debt

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,490
load which is about six point eight and

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,520
even four percent is a banner year for

00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:12,400
approximately 60 years the average was

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,580
less than 1% profit and the whole reason

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,400
we go to an airport obviously to fly the

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,370
guy selling you the $10 coffee he's

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,140
making margin the airline's not so much

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:30,250
so they should sell coffee they do they

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,650
give you a cup of coffee an ad and I

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,390
love this number eight dollars and 27

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,490
cents that's what we are all worth as we

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,640
sit in the seat it's again a little bit

00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:43,150
higher in North America last year fuel

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,970
is a huge driver of margins in the

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,740
aviation space whether you're spending

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,630
time sitting on a tarmac whether you

00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,580
turn on the air-conditioning while your

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,520
passengers are coming on all of these

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,410
eat into your fuel costs and we all know

00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,730
that oil and get had spend cheap

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:03,280
recently however it still ends up being

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,430
even with the low prices it still ends

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,010
up being 28% of their operating costs so

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,050
when you look as an airline you're

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,940
looking at where do I generate new

00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,430
revenue how do I affect my bottom line

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,700
fuel has traditionally been one of the

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,699
easiest places to go the more savings

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,940
folks like GE can bring into engine

00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:28,270
the better the industry does however as

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,919
we all know we pay for bags now there

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:35,139
are more and more services that are

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:39,610
coming online from Wi-Fi to bag delivery

00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:41,740
services to check your own systems all

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,350
of these come into the challenge of

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,620
having to get transparency again across

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,410
this ecosystem of loosely coupled

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,500
partners there's a lot of regulation

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,850
that sits in the middle of being able to

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,780
cooperate with your partners there's

00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,790
also a lot of coopertition and that's

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,030
really across the field that's been set

00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,500
up historically by dynamics between the

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,290
landlords of the airport the tarmac

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,300
services who's allowed to do what when

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,419
and how and the fact that it again

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,250
changes at each Airport you go to so a

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:18,010
system that is going to address this

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,530
that's going to allow information to be

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,110
shared across this value chain in a

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,900
meaningful way has to be able to do that

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,930
in a real-time and has to be able to

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,760
take an advantage of all the policies to

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,220
meet all the compliance metrics but then

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,350
also to pull that together in a way that

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:43,030
can be seen and arbitrated in real time

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:45,520
so by that I mean if if if SFO which is

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:49,050
fairly progressive Airport wants to be

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,130
able to do just-in-time gate allocations

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,380
they've got to be able to figure out

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,200
what are their resources available when

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,630
a pay lean is down and who's on that

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,000
flight who's on that flight is not

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,310
something SFL knows they want to be able

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,070
to move a full flight coming in from a

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,450
very long flight very long flying time

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,419
they want to be able to move that right

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,500
near all of the retail space because

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,639
those are the people who are getting off

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,110
the plane and they're going to go buy

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,750
something to eat they're going to go I

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:23,760
mozi their way down and and that

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:28,950
increases the value of that real estate

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,950
figuring out how to share information is

00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:34,030
certainly a challenge doing so in real

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,580
time is even more so

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,040
IOT has been identified by a bunch of

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,900
things the Internet of Things a number

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,070
of players Airlines being chief among

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:47,560
them believe IOT is the answer and not

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,920
just because IOT is at the top of the

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,740
Gartner hype curve but actually because

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,080
being able to measure physical entities

00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,110
in real time gives a single shared point

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,150
of truth so if I know where that bag is

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,310
because that bag has a GPS location it's

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:07,060
telling me where it is I don't have to

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:10,360
trust your 1970s enterprise software

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,640
system that probably isn't up and

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,470
running today or some guy who says no I

00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,810
totally saw it five minutes ago

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,600
I know where it is and if we can agree

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,280
on that point then we can you know share

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,020
resources and make sure that we're going

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,060
to grab that bag and we're going to

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,590
deliver it to the uber that somebody

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,630
paid fifteen bucks to have their bag

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,150
deliver to their uber rather than having

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,550
to run to the carousel frankly I would

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,850
rather pay to have my bag delivered to

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:41,110
my car then pay that $25 to get it on

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:45,070
the plane there are lots of areas where

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,300
IOT is already in the airport smart

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,650
baggage is something we're going to talk

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,870
quite a bit about so I won't go into

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,640
depth there there are airport there

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,590
beacons for a couple of different

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,050
purposes one is to help with the flow of

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,840
traffic through the airport another is

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,090
to manage the retail spaces and be able

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,820
to justify the high rents that they are

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,380
charged another is actually security

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,350
they want to be able to do behavioral

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,140
analytics wouldn't it be great if there

00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,970
was no TSA if you just walked through

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,860
the first part of the airport and based

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,320
on how your behavior and who they've

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,479
identified you are gives them a risk

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,610
profile by which they're then watching

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,680
every move you make it's already

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,600
happening they're already watching it

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,540
would be easier if they could figure out

00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,460
your risk assessment profile and then I

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,990
don't have to stand in line in TSA for

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,550
three hours in flight infotainment is

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,080
another area where they're getting more

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,990
and more information about us as

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,620
consumers which again helps lead into

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:47,180
the airport ecosystem itself and

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,550
equipment telematics when you land

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,350
and your flight is early and you sit

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,390
there for 30 minutes because the gate is

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,310
not ready it's rarely that there isn't

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,620
an open gate there's almost always an

00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,210
open gate so that they can't get they

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,940
don't know where the baggage carts are

00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,890
they can't get the staff coordinated to

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,709
be able to get the equipment they need

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,899
the gate handling the ramps they can't

00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:11,209
coordinate that in real time so knowing

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,190
where what's available what's scheduled

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,680
and being able to do that dynamically is

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,260
very important and in fact it's the turn

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,820
at the gate that determines whether the

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:27,200
next flight is going to be on time or

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:29,270
not so we believe that in order to keep

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,610
all of these airport ecosystems to be

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,529
able to provide control to the to the

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,290
different stakeholders who need control

00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:39,170
of their assets but still be able to

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,480
securely share information and insight

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,089
level information amongst those

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,390
ecosystem players we really need a multi

00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:50,480
cloud solution and that's again provides

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,070
each airline has a good sense of their

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,200
own IT they've been doing it for a long

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,720
time these are very well developed

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,550
systems so we're not trying to replace

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,529
that we're trying to add a layer on top

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,750
that provides the micro services

00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:04,250
architecture and frankly gives all of

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,010
the information and insight and allows

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,440
you to combine it in a meaningful way so

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,810
in the fifth element when you needed to

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,839
go anywhere whether a cab or a flight

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,209
you had your multi paths so we think

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,230
there needs to be a multi pass just

00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:24,350
spelled a little bit differently and

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,550
this is actually we talked to players

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,529
across the field

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,750
m2m I came to this space because we had

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:32,660
a lot of device vendors those guys who

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,400
sell the baggage guns and you know

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,779
things you drop into your bag to know

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,430
where it is and you can text something

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,850
and find out your bag tells you it's

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,370
been mishandled we also have a bunch of

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,470
folks that have GPS on the telematics on

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,360
those they're called ld3 carts

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,100
they've got special carts that will tell

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,010
you if the bag was put on the right cart

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,270
or not and some self dropped baggage

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,880
devices obviously ge comes in from

00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,110
initially the jet engine

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,550
then of course a lot of predictive

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,520
maintenance an airport operations

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,110
standpoint so being able to combine that

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,240
type of information it's at the

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,370
interfaces of those traditional silos

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,300
that frankly there's new revenue and

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:15,970
there's new efficiencies to be gained so

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,910
we got together and said what can we do

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,910
to help the industry and we created this

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,500
Airport ecosystem testbed we are

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,640
initially as I mentioned focused on

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:30,760
smart baggage but these are our players

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,350
it's GE m2 am i an Oracle Oracle's got

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,990
an aviation data model they've been

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:38,050
playing with IATA for a very long time

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,930
on what is a standard way of presenting

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,390
frequent-flyer information it's really

00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,820
impressive when you can take passenger

00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:49,900
information and combine it with IOT

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:52,930
information things like hey Shawn's bag

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,570
hasn't made the flight yet how valuable

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,490
a frequent flyer is he is he worth

00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,860
holding the plane by 5 minutes in order

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,780
to get that bag on or we're just going

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,280
to take the $250 charge and have it

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:08,110
delivered to him and his final location

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,690
I'm sure he's worth the 5-minute wait

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:15,580
but it's Oracle's data model that helps

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:17,200
them identify that again the sort of the

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,750
other piece of this and and although we

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,770
will talk quite a bit about baggage

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,300
because there have been some recent

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,940
regulations and it's an excellent use

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,650
case where you've got all of us as

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,020
consumers adding devices into the

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,280
ecosystem which are untrusted plus

00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,260
you've got a bunch of things sitting on

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,560
the tarmac which are controlled by the

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,110
airport and or by the airlines and their

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,510
operators so those are generally a

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,940
trusted environment and so that that's a

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,670
very interesting ecosystem if you can

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:49,990
address a mixed trust environment in a

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:52,870
meaningful way so taking a quick look at

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,580
self dropped bags and I promise we're

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,340
getting onto the Cloud Foundry bits and

00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,630
Y Cloud Foundry but again just to sort

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,990
of set this up you'll see there's a lot

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,880
of messaging that goes on between we've

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,290
got new bags which have built in IOT

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,410
components Samsung

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,509
one blue smart Regan there frankly all

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,980
over the place at the moment we also

00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:14,560
have tags you can drop into a

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,509
traditional bag it gives essentially the

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,070
same information very different format

00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:19,959
many of these guys have been building

00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,880
these for years they wrote their own

00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:26,560
tcp/ip stacks thank you very much

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,269
it's this is another industrial

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,100
component where everybody wrote

00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:32,920
components they wrote their own staffs

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,380
they wrote their own protocols nothing

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,930
is standardized and it's tends to be

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:41,860
very limited resource devices they're

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:45,449
also a bunch of self drop components so

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,769
one of the key pieces of IOT and any

00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:49,899
ecosystem but particularly in airports

00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:53,050
is that real time availability of

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:56,649
information so although we talk a lot in

00:13:53,050 --> 00:14:00,790
cloud systems about fresh data and stale

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:03,160
data and historical data this turns very

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,779
stale very fast you need to be able to

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,459
share information and you need to be

00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:08,440
able to do it consistently and quickly

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:10,779
with the players who can consume it

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:20,050
while it's fresh it doesn't matter where

00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:21,639
your bag was if you're already home so

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,949
again these are just sort of who the

00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:26,560
players are and what I wanted to point

00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:28,930
out here we're gonna talk a little bit

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,180
about GES pre Dix cloud obviously cloud

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:34,149
foundry environment m2a my runs on

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,220
predicts oracle is at this point in

00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,839
Oracle's cloud but we'll also be running

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,920
on predicts as a micro services

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,050
architecture the m2 my components are

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,670
composable IOT elements so they do a

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:49,300
bunch of functionality again its

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:51,430
services but the real interesting thing

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,670
here is all of the different components

00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:57,819
so in this one dataflow we've got

00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,439
Bluetooth we've got MQTT and these are

00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:02,490
from the device vendors this isn't me

00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:05,620
just putting up the IOT primordial soup

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:10,060
we've got the proprietary tcp/ip I

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,370
mentioned and the radar guns can

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,950
actually be switched between HTTP and

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,810
mqtt

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,060
but they give you different outputs

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,750
depending on the protocol you select so

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,750
that's always fun

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,140
so why cloud foundry especially given

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:31,110
the complexity and the heterogeneity of

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,150
IOT talking about all of those transport

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,000
protocols all of the different data

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,490
structures that's a lot of processing to

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,580
be able to put elements into Cloud

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,130
Foundry and certainly Diego helps a lot

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:47,460
with some of the routing capabilities

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:50,250
around TCP I can't wait for some UDP

00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:53,670
stuff too because everybody has built

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,830
something but essentially what we've

00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,680
done is we have moved some of those

00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:01,290
components which don't currently conform

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,360
to cloud foundry into a distributed node

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:07,290
empty em eyes components are distributed

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,530
so we can move some of the data handling

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:13,980
and the device management which is you

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:15,600
know over-the-air configurations we can

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,090
move that out to a distributed element

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,980
usually sitting at the airport

00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,110
although it can also sit at empty Emma's

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,310
environment it's really just essentially

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:28,770
outside of Cloud Foundry at this moment

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:31,020
we pass information securely onto the m2

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:34,530
a my central platform which is sitting

00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,390
on GE predicts we are leveraging a

00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:42,320
number of the services from predicts

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:46,080
around there MQTT support as well as

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,480
some of their data services the data

00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,060
comes in Newton other things people

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,760
always talk about in IOT is if you've

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,100
got a line of let's say a conveyor belt

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,110
and you want to be able to figure out

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,650
where the bag was at a specific time

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:04,320
you'll get a notification from the bag

00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,780
and you'll get a notification from the

00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,300
conveyor belt itself they are time

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,100
stamped they don't happen magically

00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,810
simultaneously so if you're building a

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,880
record for something like the Oracle

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,770
data model or other analytics packages

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,020
you've got to have a consistent record

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,089
of the information of that system it's

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,400
sort of a snapshot but all you're really

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,470
given is pixels so a big piece of the

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,070
data components here are actually

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,050
putting together though

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,670
pixels those bits of information from

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,740
all the different devices and building

00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:36,750
out that snapshot that then the

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:40,780
analytics packages can go and do that's

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:44,590
a challenge in and of itself but it is

00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,300
the sort of first pass of how you get to

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,830
the in-stream analytics which are the

00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:54,040
the good parts here the whole point of

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:57,160
this is the services layer so the sort

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,620
of Kassel top there is us serving

00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,890
information and accepting commands down

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:06,010
from higher-level applications so this

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:08,860
environment allows Airlines allows

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,170
device vendors allows service operators

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,720
to be able to get the coherent

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:17,140
information they need and have access to

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:21,610
the privacy module is contextually based

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:23,920
so that means that it has a model of the

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,260
state of the system and it provides

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,810
guidance on whether you get access to

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,450
the data you want for instance if a bag

00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,950
has been identified as a security risk

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,590
you may not get access to that

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,050
information because it's been removed

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,900
from essentially your whitelist of

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,070
shared information unless your TSA in

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,660
which case you may be the only one who

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,100
gets access to it

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,990
that ability again to do real-time

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,930
responsive security around information

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,510
is absolutely critical to not just the

00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:59,500
airport but industrial ecosystems at

00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:01,000
large and it's again it's not something

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,130
that you want to build policies around

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,320
you want something that can keep a track

00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:08,830
of the system itself because you will

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,260
never have enough policies to cover

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:15,490
enough scenarios to get the system

00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,230
locked down this also provides a

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,510
complete audit trail for everything that

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:24,460
happens in the platform as well as in

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:27,750
the airport we are providing application

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:31,150
development again on Cloud Foundry which

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,590
gives the airlines as well as others who

00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,980
are writing applications to this the

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,270
flexibility of writing on predicts and

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,760
then moving to whichever cloud they want

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,350
again this is not about driving down

00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,420
some kind of vendor lock-in this is

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,210
about opening up the data in a

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:54,230
controllable way that compliance can

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:55,850
measure and that's good for me

00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:08,059
shams gonna talk to us a little bit

00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:08,890
about particularly how predicts thank

00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,679
you Sarah

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,480
Shoji has a long history in aviation we

00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,910
make about two-thirds of the world's

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,429
commercial jet engines and historically

00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:21,830
we have learned how engines operate so

00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:25,130
we know how to make them more efficient

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,050
from fuel perspective or reduce

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:30,230
unplanned downtime using industrial

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:32,720
Internet the number one passenger

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,790
complaint will always be that flight is

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,040
on time or at least it takes them to the

00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:39,040
destination and everything else follows

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,630
so for a long time we have embedded

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,429
sensors in jet engines use that data

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:53,090
through products platform built

00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:56,990
industrial analytics to analyze that

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:59,360
information help in flight efficiency

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:02,090
for our operators which are typically

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,300
the airlines and the domain knowledge we

00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:08,240
have acquired around aircrafts airports

00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:11,120
we are now bringing into the airport

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,520
domain and focusing on the

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,160
inefficiencies that are in and around

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,150
the airport an airport is exactly where

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,800
the passengers meet the airlines and

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:24,710
Airlines meet the airports which are

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,750
essentially extensions of cities so one

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,710
way to look at airport is like a mini

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:33,860
city it has all those problems like

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:40,390
traffic congestion movement security and

00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:44,090
so on so in order to power this

00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,760
application for aviation or we are

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,020
leveraging predicts some of the

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,450
capabilities of products are being able

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,899
to map

00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:56,510
acquired the information from assets

00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:59,240
will the model of assets so that you

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:03,740
know what does the sensor data coming

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:07,429
from a different sensor mean and how do

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,700
you add value or metadata to the sensor

00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:14,480
information so that it can be analyzed

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:17,360
in context of the enterprise data and

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,700
once you have figured that out you can

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,240
create industrial data analytics to help

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,610
optimize so for instance collecting

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,580
information about passenger flows to the

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,740
airport or baggage flows we can learn

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,799
over time what is the best way to

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,120
optimize operations for instance one of

00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:38,559
the airports

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,580
looks at the number of people or bags

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,740
transferring between the two flights

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,899
that are landing close to each other in

00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,269
time and they can dynamically put them

00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:49,639
in gates next to each other so that

00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:52,190
passengers don't have to walk across

00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:55,600
terminals and the bags can easily move

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:59,929
from one aircraft to the other and

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,299
typically happens in earth airports

00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:04,279
which are typically used for flying

00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:07,549
through so the Middle Eastern airports

00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:10,130
are typically where people fly through

00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:12,620
them or London UK even though it's a

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:15,080
small country has second highest number

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,710
of air travel after us because a lot of

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,510
people fly through those airports and

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,639
optimizing the operations based on

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,679
information whether it's passenger the

00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:26,840
bags or other things or availability of

00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:32,409
ground equipment as Sarah mentioned can

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,409
help to add efficiency at the airport

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,909
so next we look at some of the

00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:40,250
capabilities of critics platform in

00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:42,960
details

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:46,350
it's obviously built on Cloud Foundry

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,510
provides data infrastructure that can be

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,419
used for persisting the data and our

00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:53,760
goal is to insulate the developer from

00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:57,149
the actual technologies used for data

00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,929
store rather expose them as API suite

00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:05,159
relational objects store time-series key

00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:09,059
value pair and so on and then you can

00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,950
use asset services analytics and other

00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:14,039
kinds of services that we make available

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:21,179
to quickly how to build business

00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:24,510
applications so as we start our journey

00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:26,279
of building applications for aviation

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:29,659
industry we have a sort of road map

00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:32,190
where our first application is around

00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:34,230
baggage handling efficiency and there

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,049
are business reasons for doing that

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,990
IATA which is international air travel

00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:42,059
association has come up with a

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:44,700
regulation it's called resolution 753

00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:47,490
which will require the airlines to have

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:50,789
the end-to-end custody information of

00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:53,429
bags by June 2018 now it might sound

00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:55,710
funny that we give our bags to align we

00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:59,130
expect them to have our bag information

00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:02,309
with them but the reality is once the

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:04,500
bag leaves the airline chaos it is in

00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:06,450
conveyor belts or other equipments which

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,360
are operated typically by third parties

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,370
airports baggage handling companies and

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,100
then we went if there is a connection

00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:16,889
again the airline may have no control in

00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:19,470
that Airport where the bag transfers and

00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:21,690
then at the destination Airport again

00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:25,880
the ground services which may or may not

00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:28,799
be airline's own have the bag so today

00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,750
different parties use different

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,950
information some use paper manifest

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,840
handguns and so on it's actually very

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,880
difficult for airline to have the

00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,070
baggage information end-to-end and as a

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,529
result 7 out of thousand bags are

00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:46,770
mishandled which includes delay damage

00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:49,169
and loss and when that happens

00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:51,539
airlines incurred on an average hundred

00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:54,510
dollars to repatriate Adelaide back and

00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:58,950
if a bag is lost in u.s. the liabilities

00:25:54,510 --> 00:26:00,960
as much as $3,300 so and we saw how thin

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,730
the operating margins for airlines are

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,940
so every bag they can prevent

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:10,230
mishandling is edge to the bottom line

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,450
and adding sensing so today typically

00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:15,179
bags I have a printed two-dimensional

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,940
barcode which can be only scanned by

00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,159
line of sight so the scanning hits are

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,350
very poor if we make it

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,860
three-dimensional it can be an active

00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:28,320
sensor or 3d printing barcodes as

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:31,950
possible now so that can improve the

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,610
efficiency of the baggage handling

00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:39,539
system once we are done with the baggage

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:42,500
handling we have a roadmap of taking

00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:46,169
this to other areas such as connecting

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,149
passengers which on permission so your

00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:49,710
smartphone can be used for tracking your

00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:51,570
location that can help the airline's

00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,330
tell where the passenger is how long

00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:56,460
should flight be held and so on a crew

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,500
often airlines have no clue where the

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,419
crew is they only know where they landed

00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,610
at the last gate but don't know how long

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:06,169
it will take them to get to the aircraft

00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:09,750
likewise for ground handling resources

00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:12,240
vendors and retail retail is a big

00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,700
source of non aeronautical revenue for

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,620
the airports and airlines so there is a

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,690
lot of efficiency we can drive by

00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:22,200
connecting the passengers and the retail

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:24,570
related services and finally the number

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,390
one in a recent survey the number one

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:30,000
desire of airline passengers has been

00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,860
guided navigation through the airport

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,350
there was recently a New York Times

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,690
article which said airports are designed

00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:39,179
for everyone except the passenger

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,520
airlines have been focused on guiding

00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:43,470
the aircrafts from gate to gate very

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,510
efficiently but it seems nobody has

00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,610
really paid attention on the passengers

00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:50,130
so guided navigation at the airport

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:52,080
especially for first if your first time

00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:57,750
in an airport you're not a frequent

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:59,470
traveler can be of much value so our

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,240
goal is to

00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,460
partner because we can innovate faster

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,470
we can solve real-world problems faster

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,320
it's too big of a space for any one

00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:11,889
company or airline or Airport to try to

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,110
handle it and that's why we leaned on

00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:17,200
the industrial internet consortium which

00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:20,440
has over 250 companies we all these

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,169
companies like GE Oracle am ii am i are

00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,629
all members of that and we decided to

00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:29,230
collaborate to innovate and we are

00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:31,389
always open to have new partners there

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:35,559
could be sensor providers telecom

00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:39,850
providers or different services that can

00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:43,389
be used to solve this problem so that

00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:45,100
brings an end to this I don't know if we

00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,690
have time for questions but we will be

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,049
