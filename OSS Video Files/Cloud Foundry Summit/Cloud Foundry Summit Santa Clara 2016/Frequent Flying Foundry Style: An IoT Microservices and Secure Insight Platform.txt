	Frequent Flying Foundry Style: An IoT Microservices and Secure Insight Platform for the Aviation Industry - Sarah Cooper, M2Mi & Shyam Nath, GE Digital

The potential role of Internet of Things in next generation Airports and the broader Aviation Ecosystem is astounding. From reducing trip time to decreasing on-tarmac collisions, IoT’s enablement of shared real time resources and cross-ecosystem collaboration dramatically changes the value generation game in a traditionally siloed industry. The key to unlocking the cross-ecosystem potential is the creation of a secure, shared Aviation services platform that allows stakeholders to securely share insights without compromising data integrity and ownership. CloudFoundry is the perfect basis for such an industry shared resource. 

M2Mi and GE, along with several industry players are developing an Industrial IoT platform for Aviation based on the combination of M2Mi’s IoT platform and GE’s Predix platform on Cloud Foundry. This Aviation Shared IIoT Services platform serves as the basis for the Industrial Internet Consortium's Aviation Testbed and consists of aviation and airport control and data services with industry specific microservices for the real time management of cybersecurity, insight generation and private information sharing. We’ll walk through the architecture and Cloud Foundry components that are re-imagining air travel and aviation for the industry at large.
