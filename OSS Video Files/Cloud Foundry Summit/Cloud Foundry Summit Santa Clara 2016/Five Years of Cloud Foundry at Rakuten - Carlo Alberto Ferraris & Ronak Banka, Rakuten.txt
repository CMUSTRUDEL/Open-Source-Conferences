Description: 
	Five Years of Cloud Foundry at Rakuten - Carlo Alberto Ferraris & Ronak Banka, Rakuten, Inc.

A team of seven engineers at Rakuten has been running Cloud Foundry in production for five years on over 5,000 virtual servers. In this talk we'll look back at the experience acquired in the past five years and the goals for the next five. We'll share some of the solutions we're building to empower our users - like how we implemented placement pools to run applications in different networks/environments, how we deploy a single Cloud Foundry environment on multiple virtual infrastructures and how we collect and process logs and metrics - as well as how we're applying what we learned from running one of the biggest Cloud Foundry deployments worldwide to make operations and maintenance efforts scale efficiently.
