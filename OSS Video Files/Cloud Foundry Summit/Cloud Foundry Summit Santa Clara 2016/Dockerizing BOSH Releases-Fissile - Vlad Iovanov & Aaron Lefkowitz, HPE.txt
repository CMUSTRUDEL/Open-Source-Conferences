Description: 
	Fissile is a tool that allows developers to convert BOSH releases into Docker images as part of a build pipeline. 

Because BOSH releases are precisely structured, we are able to craft Docker images that contain jobs and packages, similar to what you get after BOSH provisions you a VM. The difference is that with Fissile, this process happens in as part of your build (not at deployment time), and there are no Agents involved. The result - you get to deploy Cloud Foundry as Docker images and configure them via environment variables. 

Fissile is written in Go. It provides a CLI that takes you each step of the process: package compilation, job configuration, Docker layer management and final image creation. It has multi-release support, so you can create Docker images with components from more than one release.
