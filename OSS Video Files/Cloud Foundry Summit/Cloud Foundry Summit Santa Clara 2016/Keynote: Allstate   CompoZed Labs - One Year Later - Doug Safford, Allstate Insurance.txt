Title: Keynote: Allstate   CompoZed Labs - One Year Later - Doug Safford, Allstate Insurance
Publication date: 2016-05-29
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Santa Clara 2016
Description: 
	Keynote: Allstate/CompoZed Labs - One Year Later - Doug Safford, Vice President in the Allstate Technology & Strategic Ventures Group, Allstate Insurance

At the 2015 Cloud Foundry Summit, Allstate spoke about their goal of being thought of as more of a software company. Transforming an 85-year-old Fortune 100 company involves creating a shift in how to conduct business, but also in how technology can facilitate and even increase this process. The threats and issues facing Allstate’s business-technology transformation are typical of many large companies. 

Doug will discuss how Allstate’s technology strategy has shifted since 2015 as the insurance giant moves aggressively to the cloud. Doug will also cover how far Allstate has come in the last year, what's been working, the challenges that remain, and the journey which continues full speed ahead.

it's great to be back here a year later

00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,609
and we're very excited that yesterday

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:11,429
allstate was announced as a gold member

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:12,920
for the Cloud Foundry organization thank

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,839
you

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,630
many of you know allstate we're leader

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,160
in the insurance space we're

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,650
conservative company in a very

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,439
conservative industry it's all about

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,080
risk but what you may not know is that

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,040
Allstate is aggressively moving to

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,540
embrace the fail-fast culture many

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,710
people think that you have to throw away

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,090
the old way to bring in the new way but

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,250
what I want to share with you today is

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,480
that a large successful company can

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,960
continue to maintain leadership

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,480
dominance while at the same time

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,559
incubating the startup mentality culture

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,670
and know-how it's not an either/or you

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,100
can do both and you can do both well I

00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,070
work for a great company we help protect

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,239
people from life's uncertainties now and

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,239
far into the future

00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,680
last year we handled over five million

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,689
claims since we were here last year at

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,299
the summit we've moved up five spots on

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,479
the Fortune 100 and gained another

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,250
billion dollars in revenue we're

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,340
committed to sustaining that leadership

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,310
and the culture of innovation is alive

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,950
and well at Allstate we're doing great

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,990
right now but we know that we need to

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,110
earn the right to continue to do well

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,110
and continue to do well in the face of

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,630
many threats since we were here a year

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,170
ago it looks like autonomous cars will

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,049
be here even sooner and 70% of our

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,630
business is auto insurance

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,909
so like anti-lock brakes and airbags

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,930
we'd love to be a big part of that

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:57,000
change but it's still change nonetheless

00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,880
and it seems like every day more and

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,049
more money is going in to software

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,450
startups in the insurance space and to

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,640
me this is kind of analogous to when

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,370
cars were being manually built and the

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,590
assembly line came the companies that

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,370
didn't adopt to that new process and new

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,650
technology's failed eventually and we do

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,870
not want to be one of those companies so

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,590
we must maintain growth and build out

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,989
our culture of innovation and so we're

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,299
moving from waterfall development to

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,790
agile development on Cloud Foundry more

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:34,680
specifically extreme agile on Cloud

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,379
Foundry because that's where we see the

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,870
biggest bang for the buck we're putting

00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:43,319
our foot on the gas and accelerating and

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,769
so that's what composed labs is all

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:49,560
about some enterprises create separate

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:52,280
companies far away from the mothership

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,989
and then put their new people and new

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,299
technologies in that new company and

00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,519
then smash it together against the

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,680
mothership and that works for a lot of

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,579
companies but we decided to go in a

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,250
different direction

00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:08,879
so we created an internal brand called

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:12,180
compose labs to provide focus to our new

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:16,010
way of developing software and our

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,389
brilliant platform leader Matt curry

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,400
will be speaking today at noon so I

00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:21,989
really encourage you to attend that talk

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,609
he's going to talk about compose labs

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:28,319
and our thinking around that so like any

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:32,819
great startup we started with a small

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,220
band of believers led by Andy Sydney a

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,250
lot of large companies would go higher

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,750
the alphabet soup a consulting firms but

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,579
we realized at the time that they were

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,130
trying to transform themselves as well

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,599
so it wasn't going to work for us so we

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:50,430
took ownership and we started to grow

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,040
our mantra was everything changes and

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,519
this is more about the business changing

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,650
than just technology but we had to start

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,790
in technology to prove to the business

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,030
that we could run in January of last

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,700
year we partnered with pivotal labs

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,970
across the United States and in Europe

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,370
and we started building products that

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,820
had no integration at all and very

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,090
quickly started to find early adopter

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,550
business partners to start spreading

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:25,740
what we were doing and so I lead the

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,400
technology innovation group and we had

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,860
been building

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,750
market tests and prototypes for key

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,550
business leaders and so we approached

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,650
those leaders feeling we had some trust

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,720
built up and said we want to do things a

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,360
new way and you're gonna have to change

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,729
too and so they agreed to give us a

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,800
chance and starting in January of last

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:46,889
year like I said we moved from no

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,370
integration at all to integration with

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,990
some of our most core systems - at the

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,300
end of the year we were working on some

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,400
of our state's most strategic

00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,820
initiatives and in November of last year

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,340
we were working on 17 products 16 were

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,370
built just by all Staters and only one

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,320
we were using pivotal for help so don't

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,229
say don't think that you don't have the

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:15,600
talent to do this you need enough talent

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:18,240
to get started product mindset I can't

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,460
emphasize this enough it's our biggest

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,570
vulnerability if all of this is about

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:26,250
building software faster and not

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,960
building the right things it doesn't

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,539
matter you have to build the right

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,260
things so we take the business leaders

00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:36,690
vision and we quickly move towards a

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,190
Minimum Viable Product we grade

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,590
ourselves with key performance

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,370
indicators and that's how we dual out

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,680
more money for the effort many companies

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,539
want to meet with us and and they asked

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,370
you know we started a few years before

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,430
you but we're still chipping around the

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:56,849
edges how did you guys get so aggressive

00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:00,060
so quickly and you know to me it really

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:02,610
boils down to three things number one is

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,820
to find the right early adopters we

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,770
needed to have those people that didn't

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,650
want to avoid the risk and wanted to

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,500
jump off the cliff with us early both in

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:16,320
business and technology now compose Labs

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,830
is an entire technology effort and a

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,530
business transformation number two a lot

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,210
of companies told us that they sent

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,240
their five best people to pivotal and

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,070
they came back and then got crushed what

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,020
we did at all-state was we took my

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,419
technology innovation group which is was

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,870
about 30 to 50 of our best engineers and

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,780
sent them to pivotal to learn the

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,610
pivotal way and so by

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,400
having that many people and by building

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,250
that kind of success quickly we were

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,880
able to establish momentum and overcome

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:53,210
resistance and then third I mentioned it

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,580
earlier we had a very methodical and

00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,800
strategic plan to go very quickly from

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:03,389
just chipping around the edges too deep

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,570
into our course systems so now we're

00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:09,840
working on global development we have

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:12,750
teams across the United States and in

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,750
Europe and in India and for us the scale

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,270
we have to succeed at global development

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:22,520
so what we're looking at is building out

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:25,880
large scale applications with multiple

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:29,220
independent teams that are integrated

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,110
with the larger effort we're working

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,310
through that now to me it's not that

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,040
different from when we were building

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,870
services for internal applications

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,690
you're not going to have all those teams

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,120
in one spot but if you try to do it the

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,250
extreme way where you have co-located

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,919
teams with a product manager engineers

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,290
and designer and have those teams in

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,610
different parts of the world if it's a

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,600
logistical puzzle

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:57,030
it's a coordination issue but we can do

00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,950
it and we're looking to have daily

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:03,180
stand-ups with the product management of

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:05,250
those independent teams and we're really

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,590
pushing on this because we cannot be

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:12,240
successful if we can't build on a global

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:15,150
scale one of the really cool things was

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,570
when we when we got started through last

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,580
year every delivery area so we have six

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,190
to ten major delivery areas at Allstate

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,690
you can imagine what our IT budget is so

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,690
each one of these areas is a software

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,580
shop in its own right but every one of

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,890
those leaders stepped up and did at

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,360
least two products last year and it was

00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,150
really important for us because we

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,979
needed to make sure that these areas

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,620
lived it and learned it so that we could

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,539
plan future work and so as we move

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,760
through 2015 the whole goal was

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,700
everybody try this dip your toe in the

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,270
water because when 2016 comes we want to

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,580
go big so eventually my vision is that

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:58,860
will be approximately 70%

00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:01,290
and extreme 30% scrum and waterfall but

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,060
even the waterfall areas are starting to

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:07,080
think about test-driven development and

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,640
tools like tracker and JIRA last year we

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,250
spent about five million dollars with

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,160
our extreme development on cloud foundry

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,750
this year it's 30 to 50 million and I

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,200
certainly expect that to continue to

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,930
grow this is a photo of one of our

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,720
product teams our developers used to be

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,840
20% productive there were in meetings

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,320
the rest of the day now they're 80 to 90

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,080
percent productive we have the same look

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,530
and feel and all compose labs throughout

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,010
the world this is one of our training

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:43,710
facilities we partner with galvanize and

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,390
do four month training classes after the

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,970
first two months the teams are actually

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,290
building products under an instructor

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:54,210
and so we're gonna train people until

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,720
there's nobody left to train or no more

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:59,810
products to build Allstate is investing

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,460
heavily in retraining our workforce we

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:06,450
all know how hard it is to get talent

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,010
nowadays since this is the cloud foundry

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,600
Summit I should say something about

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,000
cloud foundry instead of just talking

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,340
about methodologies we have two data

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,400
centers we designed and deployed an

00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:20,390
infrastructure stack to support a multi

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,920
availability zone and multi region

00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:25,050
deployment of cloud foundry each

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,350
infrastructure availability zone is

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,510
fully independent of each other and

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:34,830
represents an isolated domain across all

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,990
stacks with 30% of our virtualization

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:42,600
infrastructure in our data centers is

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:45,300
now cloud foundry it's kind of funny

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,860
when I was mentioning Matt earlier when

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,410
we built out our first datacenter we

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,640
thought great let's let's push our Cloud

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,790
Foundry instance to the second

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,020
datacenter and the team refused they

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,090
didn't want to go through what they just

00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,950
went through unless they could have it

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:04,110
fully automated and do it with one push

00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:06,060
and so okay we waited and and they

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,260
figured it out and now we can push from

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,850
one data center

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,700
complete Cloud Foundry Institute's to

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:15,360
the other in three hours with zero human

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,630
intervention just recently we had a need

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,600
to power down some of our physical

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:24,000
infrastructure which at all-state that

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,080
would mean you know a couple months of

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,180
coordination and planning dozens and

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,790
dozens of engineers on a phone call to

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,530
manage the shutdown startup and more

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,250
importantly the validation of all the

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:41,340
different applications well when we

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,880
perform this we were able to have four

00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:47,700
engineers do the entire power

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,550
maintenance in six hours and more

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:54,870
importantly we had zero impact on our

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:57,150
customers so I we've certainly built a

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,700
lot of utilities and tools to do what

00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,250
I've been describing here we're working

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:06,600
with legal right now to see if we can't

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,800
give that back to the community so all

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,510
this great stuff you'd think it's all

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,010
rainbows and butterflies but Allstate

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,000
right

00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:18,210
not quite the resistance is strong we're

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,500
an 85 year old company institutions like

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:26,820
HR security legal procurement real

00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,800
estate they have a lot of rules you know

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,810
I picture Allstate in 1931 when the

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,700
company was created just like a start-up

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,280
with all the rulebook is like one sheet

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,890
of paper and you know eighty five years

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:41,010
later you could fill a law library with

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:43,310
all of our rules but I will say that

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,330
when people internalize the threats and

00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,980
they talked to their peers at other

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,010
companies that are further ahead of us

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,930
and they they learn more they start to

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,820
see the light and there's no way we

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,560
would be as far as we are if it wasn't

00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:00,600
for those great folks in those

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:04,230
institutions that helped us we still

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,510
have a way to go after our CTO left one

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:10,020
week later the memo came down to get rid

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,700
of scooters in our hallways but you'll

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,310
see well and then we had a little

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,990
rebellion we have signs that say no

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,910
scooters allowed don't touch the

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,920
scooters by order of the management you

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,940
know that kind of stuff but you'll see

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,980
that there's a

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,510
there's a portable table tennis set

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,580
there and a soccer ball in the

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,580
background so we're still in the fight

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,940
speaking of culture it's obvious our

00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,680
culture is the hardest thing to change

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,130
in a big company right it's not about

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,200
technology it's about the culture and so

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,880
the way I look at it is that the

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,560
leadership gets it you know we see the

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,100
threats we communicated throughout the

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,200
organization we get it and the new

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,300
people and people that are tied to

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,160
technology like our engineers they kind

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,000
of get it - they're excited about this

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,680
new way for us of developing software

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,350
but with our biggest issue is in the

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,460
frozen middle so for decades big

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:08,670
companies hired compensated and rewarded

00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,100
people to take orders and so if you're a

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,410
director or a senior manager in a large

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,200
company you really fought to get to that

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,610
level and is lauded in a lot of big

00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,350
companies you try to build a little

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,050
cocoon around yourself so that you can

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,120
be safe so now we come in and we

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,430
basically say no all dad's you know blow

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,260
the whole thing up your job is not to

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,990
give and take orders your job is to

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,940
remove friction for those small six to

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,940
eight person teams and they're making

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,010
the decisions I know it's not easy for

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,960
people so when I'm asked about the

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:44,030
frozen metal I say that at all-state the

00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,930
frozen middle is is dying right now

00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,430
because again we wouldn't have been a

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,110
been able to make the progress we've

00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,910
made if it wasn't for a lot of those

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,040
folks coming on board but don't think

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,380
you're going to get everybody most of

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,990
the companies we talk to say that about

00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:03,540
30% of their people either don't want to

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:06,150
or aren't able to make the journey one

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,430
more thing about culture culture to me

00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,380
is like gravity is you try to push

00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,510
against it it'll pull you back down and

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,910
what you have to do is put in an

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,940
enormous amount of energy take some

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,950
ground hold that ground look for other

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,700
opportunities to take more ground but

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,990
eventually you pop through and for us it

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,790
would be more and more brights of light

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,990
and then once that happens you know the

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,990
culture is really changing

00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:34,720
so a little bit of a retrospective I

00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:36,850
mentioned a few of these already there

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,529
isn't a checklist there aren't enough

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,629
companies that are down this road where

00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:42,550
you can go buy a book and do step one

00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:45,449
through ten and then you're golden you

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:48,459
have to play the cards you've been dealt

00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:50,980
there's no secret to this metrics are

00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:54,040
sparse obviously you know we were run by

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,749
actuarial so they wanted to know what's

00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,670
the return on investment you know what's

00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:59,769
this compared to waterfall development

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:02,019
and when we went to companies and asked

00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:03,699
they just laughed at us they said yeah

00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:05,410
you know we were looking at that too but

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,790
we there was such an upside to what we

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,939
were doing we decided we weren't going

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:12,269
to measure that stuff anymore and so you

00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:15,399
know don't look don't look for metrics

00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,930
talk to other companies you know when we

00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,850
were trying to push this through the

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,579
institutions that I mentioned I don't

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,499
speak HR speak or legal speak it's

00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:25,809
imperative that those peers talk to

00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:28,569
their peers at other companies to find

00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:30,519
out what their what their thinking is to

00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:34,779
start breaking through some of that

00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:37,089
learning and so celebrate successes and

00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:39,490
failures what I'm talking about more

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:42,759
here is that now that we have some of

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:45,939
our extreme product development hitting

00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,860
deep deep legacy systems it's it's very

00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:50,529
encouraging when I see those legacy

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,750
areas after the initial friction start

00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:56,079
to come around they start to feel like

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,850
they can question the status quo they

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,949
can question all the rules they can

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,800
start thinking about automation and when

00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:07,780
I see that that's just incredibly

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:09,549
rewarding for us and for them so in

00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,860
closing if I hope if you got anything

00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:15,039
out of the last 20 minutes it's a big

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:17,980
companies can maintain success and also

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,559
transform at the same time it's not easy

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,980
and the resistance is strong but it can

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,919
be done one by one Allstate is living

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,220
proof that the usual excuses don't hold

00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:32,380
water it's only for small projects it's

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,419
only for new projects it's only for

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,520
innovation projects we don't have the

00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:39,520
talent our business people would never

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,220
go for it one by one we're dispelling

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,170
these and if we can do it so can you

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,260
so thank you very much for your time
