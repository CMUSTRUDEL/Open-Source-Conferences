	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,660
well good morning everyone welcome to

00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:12,809
the cloud foundry summit pancake

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:16,139
breakfast huh it's good to be here with

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:18,330
pancake bot but first I would before I

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,770
talk about pancake but I promise I'm

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,300
gonna talk about cake we packing about

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,330
the whole time we have other topics to

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,609
discuss but I want to first put a give a

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,420
big thank you to the cloud foundry

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,989
summit and the clap founders someone has

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,579
had us here we podcast it here yesterday

00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:37,260
we're so happy to be here so thank you

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,050
very much we really appreciate it and

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,879
I'd also like to thank cloud soft and

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,469
cloud soft is a sponsor of the new stack

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,469
and they've been a sponsor for a long

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,120
time and we're very happy you know to

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,760
have them part of the pancake breakfast

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,010
and we're gonna fortunately Duncan

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,199
couldn't make it but we have Adam Lewis

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,610
here moved from HS who's going to talk

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,140
you know about kind of how they're

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,520
working with with cloud soft so before

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,129
we get into the discussion which is

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,229
about just the move from disruption to

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,619
transformation the path to the multi

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,180
cloud I wanted to just you know kind of

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,290
tell you a little bit about the pancake

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,880
bot over here so you know I promise I

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,100
won't take up too much time but before I

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,770
do that Lee Cal coat is in the back and

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,630
he has question and you you'll be there

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,920
to answer your questions and if you ask

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,360
a question you get the pancake and this

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,900
was the one we just printed this morning

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,040
it's in the shape of the letter Q so I

00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,409
started these pancake breakfasts on a

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,270
last year sometime and and then I think

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,820
it was a few months ago I saw something

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,310
for the pancake bot and it I was like I

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,549
was obviously immediately like intrigued

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,170
and and it started as a Kickstarter

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,460
project and they just and they actually

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,020
found a manufacturer and they just

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,780
started to started to work with them

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,040
well so I said well let's just order one

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,540
and see what it's like well this has

00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,399
been quite the experience it's actually

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,710
giving me quite a little bit of a

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,930
education in the internet of things for

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,380
sure and I've learned more about

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,539
firmware than I ever thought I would

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,739
I've had questions people ask me it can

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,739
this be connected to an API

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,450
I don't know well laughter that's the

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,730
kind of a question when I think well

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,330
we'll have to answer the next you know

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,940
the next breakfast maybe Sarah Cooper

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,730
came by yesterday and said you know

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,220
asked what kind of chip is in it and she

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,040
said is there an ASIC in this and I did

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,560
not have the answer to that but she said

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,330
you should put an Arduino on this and

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,860
I'm thinking what gosh you know you can

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,319
can you just imagine that where you

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,870
could have like you know Alexa I want a

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,019
I want a pink pancake pretty like the

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,730
Eiffel Tower please and you know and you

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,590
know so I think that's actually in the

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,530
reality or maybe that or maybe the couch

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,030
will order you know the the pancake from

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,400
the pancake bot and start serving them

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,190
up so there's just you know endless

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,569
possibilities here but you know it

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,190
actually did make me think a lot about

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:03,750
the Internet of Things and we when we

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,569
when we're talking about distributed

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,700
computing we hear a lot about this you

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:15,959
know this concept of the Internet of

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:19,019
Things and it wasn't me pancake bot calm

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:24,650
down pancake bot everybody just dropped

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,650
the mic the cop chocolate so I

00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:41,100
oh is this because I'm sipping on a

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:42,600
cable here maybe stop that okay so but

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,890
you know we talked about connecting all

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,420
the things right that's what the

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,720
Internet of Things is all about right

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,820
and so but it's it's evident that there

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,470
that this pancake bar over here is

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,170
actually very first generation kind of

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,670
device but you know but it does speak to

00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,380
this kind of area of transformation that

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,480
we that we're seeing for instance Gd and

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,760
its predicts platform right we're seeing

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,590
all these kind of new kind of ways for

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,900
us to think about data and how we use

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,420
data and how you know how we can like

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,310
use data with applications how we manage

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,060
that data how we store it how the

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,650
networking capabilities work and so I

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,480
you know I sat down with a few people

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,730
yesterday who you know who are thinking

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,870
it you know basically there's a CIOs and

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:27,030
and and I I just can't imagine being in

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,620
their shoes right like you know and

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,150
that's really kind of gets to the topic

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,580
of the conversation today which is this

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,440
idea about disruption right and this

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,169
hold you know I worked at TechCrunch in

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,340
you know for 40 years and and we had

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,950
this event called TechCrunch Disrupt

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,000
right and it was all about disruption

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,919
and all these startups coming in to

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,330
disrupt but I kind of feel like we are

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,490
kind of moving out of this into this new

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,960
age of transformation and so I that's

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,000
kind of why I want what I wanted to talk

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,410
about today and you know instead of

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,390
hoping this will glean something for you

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,040
as you're thinking through you know how

00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,200
you're actually building out your own

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,150
distributed environments so why don't we

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,890
I'll go in alphabetical order here

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,030
according to the panelists on the slides

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:09,270
here we have a be current hey Abby hello

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:12,990
we have Adam Lewis hi Bryan Swanson

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:15,270
morning and Chris Faris howdy all right

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,040
so just again we're gonna just get the

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,229
conversation going and if you have a

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,940
question raise your hand and you'll get

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:26,820
a pancake so Abbi you know so you're the

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,320
Cloud Foundry foundation and you know

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,910
and what I really like about the Cloud

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,620
Foundry foundation is like these are

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,760
companies who are just you know you see

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,860
a lot of companies coming in trying to

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,080
think through what this transformation

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,669
means right so when you talk them what

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,890
you know what what kind of questions are

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,650
they asking I you know are they you know

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,240
you must get all kinds of kind

00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,060
you know people coming in with very

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,320
degrees of levels of expertise but I'm

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,699
just curious some of your takeaway from

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,340
that and your takeaway from the

00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:53,870
conference here well I'd say first and

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,120
foremost there's no one an expert at

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,130
transformation because it's hard it's

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,050
complicated and it isn't just a

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,660
technological issue it is a people and

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,660
processes you and for the fortune 500

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,850
global 2000 transformation is hard it

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,699
takes a long time and there isn't a

00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:14,060
shortcut to change a culture and change

00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,320
and adopt processes and and and change

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,479
the way people think about technology

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,600
and so Cloud Foundry is a great enabler

00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,910
of that conversation and a great way to

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,530
start that and enable and reinforce

00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,510
practices around continuous delivery

00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,570
test-driven development agile and lean

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,580
practices but at the end of the day the

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,860
heavy lift is really the transformation

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,090
of the culture around that so what does

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,580
that transformation is like bright

00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,910
colors and like beanbag chairs and

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,280
t-shirts you know I mean to me I when I

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,080
hear that this topic come up I think ok

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,630
transformation ok well the office

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,940
environment you know hasn't really

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,310
changed that much in the past you know I

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,900
don't know since since the post war I

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,610
mean how people more work at home right

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,039
so now they they could actually you know

00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,539
be that you know be two steps from the

00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,940
kitchen or in the kitchen so I guess

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,620
that's a change but you know what are

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,889
what are the possibilities of this

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,120
transformation of you know of like what

00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:09,500
are the things you don't want to happen

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,479
in this transformation what are the kind

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,680
of things that you you don't want to see

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,139
when when company start to go through

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,729
this transformation well you don't want

00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,490
them to assume that the transformation

00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:21,889
is the endgame right we're all agile now

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,270
so therefore we are we're innovative

00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,400
because those two are not the same

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,320
things you can transform your culture

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,030
you can become agile but that doesn't

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,250
necessarily also bring you the

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,010
innovation so I think as companies make

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,720
that shift and become able to deploy

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,240
code to production and are writing more

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,530
software and are are doing all of those

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,419
things there's a certain degree of

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,070
innovation and expectation around that

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,229
that they should also bring in because I

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,539
don't think you know having beanbags in

00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:52,850
an open workspace and and matching

00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:56,700
t-shirts makes you innovative well maybe

00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:58,170
actually probably not bruh Brian you

00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,550
know what are your you know tell us a

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,740
little bit about you know about data

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,930
skill and the transformation you've had

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,480
to go through yes so for us it was I

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,450
have turned this on

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,520
alright good you guys all can hear me

00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:14,390
for us it really was a top-down driven a

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,250
little bit of a sideline data skill

00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:19,380
services we've done a lot of traditional

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:22,020
on-premise software but our founder and

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,640
CEO also raises an offshore powerboat so

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,100
he's a world champion offshore powerboat

00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,710
racer and drives his boat at well over

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,770
150 miles an hour out in the ocean you

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,419
know bouncing around and and he wanted

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,039
to transform his sport so when you watch

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,650
on TV you saw it see all these great

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,960
animations and overlays of data if you

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,930
watch NASCAR and he wanted that to be

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,820
available for the fans as well as his

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,650
crew so he wanted to be able to get all

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,170
the data off of his boat and up for

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,540
analysis and review in real time for his

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,150
crew and also in real time for his fans

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,590
to be able to see on a webpage and what

00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,360
he came back with and says well why is

00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,550
this hard you know why can't we just do

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,250
this let's let's go innovate let's let's

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,140
make it happen at a reasonable cost and

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,140
I look at your pancake bot there and I

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,450
actually started my career and my my

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,890
degree is in robotics and so if you

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,620
looked at what the cost and the idea of

00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,910
I could have a robot make a pancake

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,230
would have been prohibited for right the

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,880
amount of time it would have taken to

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,860
build the interfaces to that right the

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,140
program to do the pancake and now you

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,050
can say you know hey hey Alexa make me a

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,390
smiley face it's actually you know it's

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,510
incredible so I think the challenge for

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,890
us is to not put some of our

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,750
preconceptions on there of well this

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,220
will cost too much or it's too hard so

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,540
what you know what can we look at and

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,850
say oh you know we could we can do that

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,190
let's try it out let's do it quickly and

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,720
for us it was that that being able to go

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,040
to multiple different sources who we've

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,990
got a lot of different race teams that

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,240
we work with each one of them with their

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,380
own data stores and their own idea of

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,450
where they're going to put data and what

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,680
cloud services they may want to use so

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,770
we had to be able to very quickly be

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,839
able to allow them to see across lots of

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,020
different options but we needed to

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,820
consolidate that up into one view for

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,830
our channel out to the race officials

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,720
the fans and the crews so Adam what does

00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,790
that mean then I think you know for

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,220
for your customers you know I think of

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,629
when I think of disruption I think of

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,879
just and sometimes I just think of my

00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:16,560
own experiences as we all have had them

00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,850
when you could you know for me

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,439
personally as a journalist I could like

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,180
I could get a blog up and running in

00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:23,310
minutes and start posting to it right

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,569
you know that to me was like amazing

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,569
self service because I came from the

00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:29,220
newspaper world where you know you know

00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:30,839
it was about you think you had to get a

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,370
printed you know wasn't nearly as easy

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,800
as a pancake but I'll tell you that and

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,569
so you know so now and so now we're kind

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,639
of moving into this world of self-serve

00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,910
right but it's not exactly self-serve

00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,709
right so but you know I'm curious about

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,019
kind of some of those you know those

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,790
things your customers want do they want

00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,110
the self-serve capabilities they not

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,449
want to have to have the service

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,339
integration or do they want to compose

00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,899
the applications themselves or do they

00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,490
want to have those those those

00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,410
applications ready maybe because we're

00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,790
talking about multi cloud platforms we

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,079
talked about this yesterday you're

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,970
talking a lot about consuming the

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:06,629
application infrastructure itself right

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:08,850
absolutely so the first thing is no

00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:10,199
customer is the same as another customer

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,879
they all want something different they

00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:14,910
all want it on-demand and as fast as

00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:18,029
possible oh the one consistency that we

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,790
continuously see is about helping manage

00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:23,189
the complexity and I think by having

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,899
standards certification and platforms

00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:27,389
that people can base and harness any

00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,160
change on then it allows a focal point

00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:31,769
to happen to accelerate and people would

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,319
trust and then you can start bringing

00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:37,350
the organization in it's people through

00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:39,420
a period of disruption because it's

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:43,019
always going to be disruptive but we can

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:47,339
help manage that with a core set of

00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:49,259
beliefs that you can then have across

00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,959
all of the organization it's people and

00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:53,910
it's never about the technology

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,250
technology is easy it's about the people

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,559
and processes and changing the mindset

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,600
and I think you can do that by say here

00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,180
here's a great example of a paradigm

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,240
that works whether it's based on Cloud

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,040
Foundry technology or any other platform

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,480
it's a standardized capability that

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,220
people can understand and it's a great

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,139
story to tell because they can believe

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,679
in it ok so let's get to the people part

00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:19,380
of it right so you know you cannot go

00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,430
from no you can't you know it's very

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,020
difficult to

00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,029
no to start really thinking about

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,000
continuous integration for example and

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:28,740
continuous delivery right so Chris you

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,050
know what are some of the pathways

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,980
you're seeing to that you know and what

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,410
are the thing you know what are the

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,910
technology you know adoption curves that

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,600
you need in terms of the people that

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,920
you're having join you so you know I you

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,570
know talk about disruption and

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,380
transformation iBM is going through a

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,770
lot of that lately

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,700
oh really yeah yes a little bit you know

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,050
any time you try and take an

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,580
organization's got you know three

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:55,290
hundred and seventy or eighty thousand

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:57,450
people and do a left turn it's it's it's

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,910
a huge challenge and you know some of it

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,220
is technology as you described I mean

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,110
this is one of the reasons why we've

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,820
embraced Cloud Foundry but also that

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,100
just one of the reasons we've embraced

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,529
open-source generally is because I think

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,350
of disruption is really being in the

00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:15,510
state of not really paying attention to

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,240
what's going on around you and being

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,070
somewhat myopic and blinkered in in your

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,850
approach to things when you're engaging

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:25,350
out in open source and various open

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,830
technology communities I think it's a

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,810
lot easier to sort of keep be aware of

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,380
what's going on around you right I think

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:36,450
that helps you prepare better to be to

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,640
be less likely to be disrupted for one

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,430
but the other aspect of it is is that

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,620
just changing people's you know Abby's

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:47,970
point changing the whole culture of how

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,980
you go about your just how the how the

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,839
company interacts with it right so so we

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,690
hear a lot about the culture changing

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,370
you know but I'm wondering about you

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,950
know for some like I'm getting this make

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,820
let's get a little bit granular okay so

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:04,829
the workflows right the workflows change

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,779
quite a bit don't think so tell it you

00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:08,250
know so like traditionally you hear a

00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,050
lot of this story about you know

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,310
throwing the application over to the new

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,740
right to the you know to the networking

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,540
team right right you know so take us

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,070
like through that as an example what is

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,470
that transformation and the workflow

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,390
that that happens when you have to think

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,579
differently about actually getting the

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,320
application employed it's a combination

00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:29,490
of changing the workflow and also

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:32,700
getting people to to be willing and

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,270
capable of doing more than just the one

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,920
thing

00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,480
they were doing before so you you know

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,100
typically you would have a development

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,810
team and they would just develop and

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,130
then you would have a QA team and they

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,420
would write the test and the developers

00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,530
would never write the test they can't

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,280
write tests they don't know how to write

00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:49,910
tests you know and and and and today in

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,420
order to achieve the kinds of

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,760
transformation that we're going through

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,210
inside IBM we actually had to sort of

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,830
completely break everything apart and

00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,170
reconstitute into these small to Pizza

00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,670
size teams that we're doing all of it

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,510
they were doing the development the

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:09,390
tests the CI pipeline all one team right

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:12,170
for a particular small you know micro

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:15,330
service II kind of a thing and and this

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,850
changes from having to interact with

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,110
some of the department where you have a

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,580
document of Understanding between two

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,620
different directors that they're going

00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,240
to do this on this kind of you know

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,370
terms and so forth and give you the

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,710
thing that no no now the team just does

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,790
it right and and it doesn't have to be

00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,800
any kind of agreement cuz you've got

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,780
this complicit agreement we're a team we

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,580
have to succeed we have a clear mission

00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,800
and and we're just going to go off and

00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,750
deliver this capability and continually

00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,810
improve it over time and as long as you

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,520
can set a clear direction from a

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,780
corporate perspective we're going to be

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,180
doing cloud we're gonna be doing

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,530
cognitive and analytics then you can

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,570
certain things just sort of trickle down

00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,330
you don't have to be in complete command

00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,590
and control you're really setting a

00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:58,020
coherent strategy and letting people

00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,690
find their own path through that ABI so

00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,110
you came from hip at all and you know at

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,780
pivotal

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,840
you have this you know they they have

00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,400
this concept pair programming can you

00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,920
explain that and how that fits into this

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,550
discussion from about from disruption to

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,040
transformation

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,810
well I think you know to add on to

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,750
Chris's point command and control and

00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,700
that that's really part of the that's

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,170
part of the the framework and the mental

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,790
set you have to break right you don't

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,340
have you can't operate in command and

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,810
control and drive at that scale and

00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,160
drive at that level and so and I think

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,610
that's where we're pair programming

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,550
really comes into play because you're

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,230
having to you know as a developer you're

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,480
having to work in tandem with someone

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,150
else at all times and there's a focus

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,130
and there is an expectation that you are

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,540
a team and and going back to the

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,880
cultural shift your your

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,560
changing the paradigm and you're you're

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,140
asking people to think about what they

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,610
do and how they do it very differently

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,590
and I think pair programming is a great

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,480
way to reinforce those behaviors and

00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,040
reinforce that expectation that you're

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,030
operating in a team you're operating a

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,590
small highly functional team that is

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,090
focused on a business outcome and I

00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,100
think that's part of the shift and I

00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:11,080
think that's where going back to

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,140
reinforced you know technology being a

00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,430
force meant as well as common habits and

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,230
common practices those to become

00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,940
reinforcements and those behaviors which

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,350
drive those outcomes maybe we've

00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,090
actually been using and also for skills

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,130
transfer right so when we break the

00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:27,010
team's down and we put you know somebody

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,750
from QA and somebody from development

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,790
and somebody from operations to get you

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,490
know put these people together pairing

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:36,250
and constant rotation helps to to share

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,110
those skills across the team and allows

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,520
us to affect that transformation rather

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,770
than having to go back to school and

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,090
figure out how to write tests and so so

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,760
Adam I'm curious from your perspective

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,160
so you know when you think about cloud

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,990
soft right you know I think a simple way

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,000
think about it is a distributed control

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,760
plane right you can compose applications

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,010
you know across vm's across containers

00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,100
across bare metal you know have this

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:02,350
kind of this capability that you know

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,220
you really haven't had before you know

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,690
that's something where these new

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,770
technologies allows like this this

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:11,650
capability how how do you help them

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:15,400
define the choices they need to make so

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:17,590
you know because you could start or is

00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,260
it you know or is it just saying to them

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,520
just try it I mean that's to me that's

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,590
always seemed like to be the right way

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,360
or more the hardest thing to do well

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,670
we've been working with Duncan and the

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,240
cloud soft team for quite some time and

00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,440
what we realized earlier on is that it's

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,730
difficult to do application

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,140
transformation and no matter how you try

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,890
and change your application landscape

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:44,200
there are always Beeson a heterogeneous

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,090
approach you need to take so there will

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,370
be old world and new worlds that have to

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,080
work together and the control plane and

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,810
one of the reasons why we use the am

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,270
product we call it compose is that it

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:57,490
aligns really well of our strategy

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,710
around all things cloud foundry allows

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,540
us to really to run and join the old

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,669
world to the new

00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,549
and the old and new world architectures

00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:07,110
together but also when we are offering a

00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:08,640
fully managed service and the name to

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,860
end basis you want all of these things

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,090
to work completely coherent Li you don't

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,309
want to have dozens of different

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:18,960
management tools you don't want to have

00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:21,600
complexity of not understanding where

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,020
your logs are and how you can really get

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,370
the value from proactively understanding

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,350
the direction of your application

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,299
landscape so then and that way you can

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,549
build added value added value services

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,940
over and above that that helps deliver a

00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:36,059
better service back to the customer

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,850
Brian

00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:40,770
any other thoughts on that you know in

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,290
particular I'm thinking about you know

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,549
how you know a data skill you've gone

00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,900
through your own internal transformation

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:48,720
what are some of those things that you

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,480
guys had to go through and tell us about

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,650
the technical kind of you know matters

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,140
that came up one of the one of the

00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,520
interesting things to me is if you think

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,150
about kind of the change we're going

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,700
through there's there's identity issues

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,490
am I you know my developer or my network

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,130
engineer right there's different kinds

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,200
of constructs now right so now we used

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,090
to think about IP and Ethernet now we're

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,750
thinking about clusters and instances

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,100
and dynamic fabrics and all the rest and

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:20,280
then and then you know then the third

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,780
part you have open source which is makes

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,309
for a much different kind of an

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,140
organization you got to think about

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:26,549
being almost like an inside-out

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,080
organization I've been talking a lot

00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:29,250
about that like you have you have an

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,900
internal engineering team but you're

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,940
also participating in external open

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,049
source communities yeah and we're

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,000
actually right in the thick of all of

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:38,669
that that's you know it's very timely

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,010
and and you know following on on what

00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:42,720
they're talking about earlier is is you

00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,700
know we've got data streaming off of

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,120
devices a lot of devices from the engine

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,080
to biometrics to weather okay great but

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,820
you just stop right there

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,030
how do you collect that data tell us

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,500
about that so so those and so so where I

00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,380
was going with this is that that has to

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,120
get from various different sources one

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,870
is from the boat itself right where we

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,790
actually use a cellular and a UHF radio

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,410
to be able to transmit that data and a

00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,780
lot of that data is being collected at

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,970
100 Hertz which is way more than you

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,750
need to show a fan view right so now all

00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,580
this doesn't trying to pump 100 Hertz

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,280
for many many different date you know

00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:21,160
devices up through cellular modem you

00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,480
know just doesn't work so so we had to

00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,700
decide you know because of that

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,060
constraint how do we then put some of

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:30,010
the smarts down at the device levels so

00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,540
now how do we push some edge analytics

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,400
push some coding down actually down at

00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,020
the device level and make it smarter

00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,060
about how it goes up so who does that

00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,790
decision and so it was very interesting

00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,770
team get together to say well you know

00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,090
do we do we think this through or do we

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,310
just start building it trying it and

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:48,670
trying different routes so right now we

00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,800
have a lot of work going on what we call

00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,300
our squid down actually on the boat

00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,730
itself to be smart about how its

00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,170
transmitting data but at some point we

00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,970
need all of that data to do the

00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,370
analytics right we need that hundred

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,110
Hertz rate of data to be able to go

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,510
through and see if there's indicators

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:07,300
predictive indicators about oil pressure

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,410
or about boost versus fuel pressure that

00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,990
means we're gonna actually need to blow

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,940
up a hundred thousand dollar engine and

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,410
so but you can't get that in real time

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,110
so how do you you know how do you manage

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:20,080
that so do you do you take it in batches

00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:22,060
then yeah so right now we're you know we

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,490
we decided to start small and work on

00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,640
just the you know the the shorter data

00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,110
rate more visible indicators so oil

00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,850
pressure is dropping down to zero or

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,800
going above a certain amount you know

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,170
throw a big red light on the - throw a

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,460
big red light to the to the crew chief

00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,750
but but we did have a lot of struggles

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,940
trying to figure out because there's so

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,650
many different routes to get there who

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,360
is making that final decision is it you

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,670
know which engineer which person is

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,060
driving that final design architecture

00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,140
and my my position was always well let's

00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,140
try out three different ways to see

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,600
which works best if it's cheap enough

00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,630
and you've got time to do it let's do it

00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:00,160
but then of course the the people above

00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,720
me are saying no no you got to tell me

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,720
what you're going to do so that's a

00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,210
challenge so if I could address the the

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,100
the question you asked about sort of

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,690
working in open source with closed

00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,730
source you know product development

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:16,590
teams and one of the things that struck

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:20,020
me is that you know this this sort of

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:21,220
this transition towards increased

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,590
continuous integration and delivery

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,970
where open source projects like cloud

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,100
foundry are started pioneering in

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,770
they're not just shipping code every

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:32,520
six months or once a year their shipping

00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,809
code every week or every two weeks and

00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,130
how does you know how does a clothes

00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:37,510
store his team keep up with that it used

00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,220
to be closer to vellum would use open

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,440
source but I just you know they would

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,720
just download the dependency and it

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,490
would be frozen in time on some DVD you

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,280
know for years and years years to come

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:51,520
increasingly these things these worlds

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,530
are so intertwined now that the

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,049
continuous integration delivery from the

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,059
open source is now sort of infusing the

00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:59,860
same considerations delivery of a closed

00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:01,630
source development team to the point

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,789
where they treat it all as a single

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,669
codebase internally but has really

00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:09,730
helped sort of turn people's view

00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:11,830
towards more open mm-hmm collaboration

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,090
which I think generally helps to

00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,030
accelerate the rate and pace of

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:20,200
innovation good so I want to open up to

00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:24,429
questions and yesterday yeah i sat down

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,950
with Sam Ramsey and you know with you

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:29,559
know with the with the with with two

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:32,049
very smart young developers and I

00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,299
thought maybe Sam if I can present you

00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:37,000
with the first pancake here the first

00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:39,039
question pancake Sam Ramsay the CEO of

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,409
the Cloud Foundry foundation maybe you

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,080
can you know talk you maybe have a

00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:45,370
question for these folks or and

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,450
basically kind of like what what

00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,200
insights you glean from them because

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,559
there's actually a very interesting

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,900
discussion just about how you know how

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,220
they're bringing on people you know and

00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:59,350
how they're training them and what

00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:01,720
transformation is made for them what do

00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:04,120
you think the best way to bring a large

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,679
organization up to speed on cloud

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,780
technologies is physically it was

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,450
specifically cloud foundry obviously but

00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,220
it represents such a different approach

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,720
to programming and when we think about

00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,400
what we've done in Silicon Valley we're

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,740
usually talking about forty person teams

00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,360
but the companies were we're talking

00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,820
about our you know a thousand person

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,030
10,000 person teams we keep hearing that

00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,590
the restriction on adoption is we just

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,020
can't hire people fast enough Allstate

00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,760
said it you know almost every major

00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,280
speaker comcast they said it so what

00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,960
what guidance do you have for for the

00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,960
community on how to get there fast

00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:46,570
I'll take that we all like a Chris you

00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:48,279
know it's interesting you know and this

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,629
is coming again from sort of an IBM

00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,389
perspective typically dealing with

00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:54,489
Fortune 500 companies with you know your

00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:57,399
search traditional software sales cycle

00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:59,769
of you know you schmooze the CTO or the

00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:03,549
CIO or whatever and and his or her team

00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:07,169
and you know and and you have to set up

00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:10,749
a POC and it's all very expensive and

00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:12,789
what we're finding is that that's you

00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:15,070
know that it's unnecessary right and

00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:17,169
what is starting to become I think a

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,499
little bit more effective is engaging

00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:23,049
developers directly right they're not

00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:26,109
afraid to just sort of get an account on

00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:28,210
bluemix or PWS or whatever it is and

00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:31,629
kick the tires and try something out

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,729
especially when it it can be done in you

00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:35,649
know in in the short term of a you know

00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:38,049
a two or three hour hackathon right and

00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:39,820
so you know increasingly it's through

00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:41,229
meetups and through hackathons and so

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,950
forth that we're starting to build this

00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:49,570
sort of bottom-up approach to having

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:51,639
this technology adopted and and that you

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,409
know then then the senior managers start

00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:55,659
hearing about it and I go I need to know

00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:57,070
more about this yeah and it really turns

00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:58,719
the whole cycle on it's I have a

00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,129
question for the audience raise your

00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:03,879
hand if you've been to a meet-up in the

00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:07,869
past year look at that almost everyone

00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:12,879
in the past six months in the past three

00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:17,589
months in the past month in the past

00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:18,999
week awesome alright so tell us why why

00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:21,549
did you tell us what meetup you you went

00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:24,609
to and this is a and tell us who you are

00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:26,710
and we met yesterday hi my name is

00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,669
Siddharth um I go to the University of

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,859
wisconsin-madison

00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:32,379
so last week I went to a Stanford

00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:36,039
igniters and entrepreneurs meet up by

00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:38,019
Don Doug low he's a game entrepreneur um

00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:41,169
who now an entrepreneur in Silicon

00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:43,839
Valley I was a great meetup he talked

00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:47,820
about startups and how he got into the

00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,820
industry and it was great

00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:05,549
sure so I haven't been to a lot of

00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,470
meetups but when I go there I see a lot

00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:11,070
of people who are older than me so

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:12,539
they're mostly in a company working for

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:16,890
a company they're either

00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:21,360
engaged in their own startup or they've

00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:24,600
been working on you know their company's

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,700
ideas in emerging technology so I go to

00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,940
meetups where they're more

00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,740
entrepreneurial focused and you know

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,380
geared towards innovation so I meet

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,539
people who are software developers

00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:40,289
entrepreneurs and people who are just

00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:41,760
engaged to learn and innovate so what do

00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:42,929
you what are you curious about when

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,919
you're talking to the companies what are

00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,900
the questions that you're having

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,390
anything more technical oriented or the

00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,549
more entrepreneurial I would say both

00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:52,110
because I'm really interested in in the

00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:55,710
conversions of both the tech and the

00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:57,330
entrepreneurial side so yeah well I have

00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,360
a question and this actually came up in

00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,190
the fireside chat with Dell yesterday

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,299
that um

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,429
companies particularly larger companies

00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:08,549
are finding new opportunities and new

00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:10,950
channels to reach students that are in

00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:13,260
college and considering a field and

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,270
they're using Cloud Foundry and the

00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,919
cloud technology is a way to really

00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,049
extend that and make it seem interesting

00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,210
is that appealing to someone like you

00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:23,580
where these larger organizations are

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,770
shifting to agile methodologies and are

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,240
using technologies like cloud foundry to

00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,610
change the way that they function and

00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,530
they work does that appeal definitely

00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,820
and for me personally too and I heard

00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,770
about Cloud Foundry I'd submit online

00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:37,580
and I wanted to learn more about it and

00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,960
it's it was there in the first page so

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,850
things like that engaging students like

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,700
offering student discounts and giving us

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,250
access to a lot of technology it was was

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,919
one of the factors why I was interested

00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,860
in this and like you mentioned companies

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,409
are opening up you know their boots and

00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,909
they come to our career fairs they talk

00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:58,710
about you know meetups and they have

00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:01,230
these information sessions so it's

00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,790
definitely engaging at least in

00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,640
University to them from my experiences

00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,140
we have an internal things lab on campus

00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,540
and we have a lot of campus engagement

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,640
with companies and it's it's been it's

00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:15,240
been very helpful for us to learn and

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,500
engage with the community so this seems

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,179
like a good opportunity for companies

00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,950
that are you know trying to hire is

00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,600
having a better outreach program and

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,130
using - the new technologies and using

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,530
the innovations as a way of pulling

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,059
people in and increasing the pipeline

00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,580
and increasing that pipeline of new

00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:32,309
development that seems this seems quite

00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,650
relevant doesn't it you know I'm curious

00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:36,960
from you know you know from our

00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,580
panelists maybe you know you know Adam

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,620
when you're going you know when you're

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,570
going out into the community what kind

00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,220
of things are you asked what kind of

00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,900
questions are you you know trying to get

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,910
answered when you're talking to people

00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,919
who are developers or office persons or

00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,630
you know like you know you know like the

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,799
people who are here what are the

00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:57,750
questions you have I think it's about

00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,880
helping people understand quite the

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,080
quite a complex set of new technologies

00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,900
and they really want to understand how

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,270
they can become part of it so Asus we we

00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:09,929
have an extensive internship program as

00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:11,580
well and a lot of the the people that

00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:14,100
I've actually had working on on my

00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,559
products around Cloud Foundry are

00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,419
literally fresh not even going to

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,570
university in some cases they are

00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:26,660
straight out of out of school and we

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:29,910
immediately build a community around

00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:32,940
that person - so how do you build a

00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:35,970
community around a person it's important

00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,650
that that we have the support networks

00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,419
in place that will make aware we got

00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:43,110
things like slack for asking questions

00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:45,240
now and we always make sure that we're

00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:48,780
doing pair programming for example and

00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,610
and they it's a learning culture it has

00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,400
to be a learning culture because people

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:55,080
people want to have and thriving and

00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,910
that knowledge for more information and

00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,260
we're all learning as we continue to

00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,090
develop open source that's what the

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,530
whole community spirit is about right

00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,030
you know Brian do you bring them out in

00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:05,040
a speed boat or something like that

00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:07,559
yeah unfortunately we don't get to go

00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:11,640
for joyrides we're working on the number

00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:13,950
two boat and for us we had a fairly

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,570
small developer team

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,550
and so really we just said you know go

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:19,260
out get an account try and build up

00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,030
something quick and easy for us so just

00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,290
pick a project to your own and I'd be

00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,940
curious as to you know after your

00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,620
meetups do you go and you know build

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:29,250
something or do something you know

00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,450
afterwards to try it out and so we just

00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:34,160
wanted to make sure that our developers

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,160
had that access to be able to do that

00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,760
competitions and hackathons can really

00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:41,520
have a nice base so so what have you

00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,800
been building so I've been working with

00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,170
Google's project tango and I've been

00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,060
working with bluemix and raspberry PI's

00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,100
so and back in the lab and back at home

00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,750
too I've been developing and I have a

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,100
team we're working on Google's project

00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,710
tango I don't know if you're all

00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,080
familiar with it it's a integrated depth

00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:00,000
sensor and indoor navigation all

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,220
integrated into one mobile device so

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,280
like a mobile device I can see and think

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,140
like humans and can navigate indoors

00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,150
without the use of a GPS or Wi-Fi or

00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,970
Bluetooth beacons and I've been just

00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:14,040
programming and hacking on it for for

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,480
the past six months and I've been

00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,300
developing an app that can navigate

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,220
indoors in my engineering building so

00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,230
this is what we do so we try to go to

00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,240
hackathons and meet new developers and

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:26,670
form a team so in the future if we can

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,530
brainstorm and come up and come with an

00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:31,290
idea we start working on it so like you

00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:33,780
said after meetups we do Network and try

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:38,900
to find people who are like-minded and

00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:41,130
want to work on innovating new things

00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,840
does anyone have any questions at all

00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,370
who like to you know just for the

00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:50,100
general crowd or for the panelists as

00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:52,320
well any questions about teams and you

00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,320
you know in how you build your teams or

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,840
the technology challenges

00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:01,280
anyone have any okay great here we go

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,280
we'll get that mic for you

00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,369
it's been a lot in that press lately

00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:12,970
about colocation versus remote work and

00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:15,790
how do you see that evolving as the push

00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:23,940
towards two pizza teams and higher

00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:26,619
efficiency comes to the front Chris sure

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:29,190
so it's interesting you know I started

00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:31,240
working on the hyper ledger project and

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,099
you know this is one of those sort of

00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,710
exciting new new things you know around

00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:39,040
blockchain and what I found really

00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:41,560
interesting is that you know people are

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,040
coming from across the globe I've got a

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,119
number of individuals whether they work

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,020
for a company or whether this is

00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:53,010
neveress students from China from

00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:56,849
Singapore from Australia from Europe

00:34:53,010 --> 00:35:01,210
from the States from South America all

00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:02,680
sort of engaging wanting to sort of and

00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,810
serve very much like what Siddharth was

00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,310
talking about in terms of this is some

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,690
cool technology I want to see what I can

00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,839
do with it I want to hack on it for a

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:13,980
while and so you've got contributions

00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:16,780
coming in and they're all very dispersed

00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,369
now the interesting thing there is that

00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,210
everybody there is coming at it from the

00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:22,630
scratch and itch

00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:25,060
kind of a perspective right and then you

00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,890
have a need for I need to get stuff I

00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,630
need to sort of meet certain deadlines

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,609
to be able to deliver a project and so

00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,349
forth and that I think typically

00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:34,420
requires a certain degree of colocation

00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:37,900
so I think the the challenges is in

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:39,520
balancing out I think that where the

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,210
real innovation happens is on those

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,619
scratch and itch kind of contributions

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,450
whereas in order to get things done

00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:49,180
typically it requires a certain degree

00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:52,630
of face-to-face collaboration colocation

00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:55,960
just to increase the fidelity and and

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,820
the bandwidth of communications so it's

00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,609
it's it's it's a delicate balance and I

00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,740
think it'll continue to evolve in that

00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:04,480
way that we'll find ways of whether it's

00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:08,190
at through a dojo or some other kind of

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,140
co-located experience to do development

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:13,089
paired with a lot of you know

00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,800
contributions coming in from people just

00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,660
scratching an inch but I would argue

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,150
that one of the

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,650
it should be that we should be focused

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,619
on the community is how to improve that

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:24,240
fidelity with more global and remote

00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:26,819
workforces because I think at the end of

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,859
the day if we're all working towards one

00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:30,390
thing which is innovating and being its

00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,700
innovative as possible with the

00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:35,460
technology that isn't something we can

00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,049
expect to house in a single room and a

00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,849
single company in a single organization

00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:41,309
and I think figuring out how we can

00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:44,369
better connect that and improve that

00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:46,170
fidelity for people as we bring in more

00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:48,780
remote workforces around the world and

00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,369
bring them all to the same projects that

00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,750
I think is a huge hurdle that I don't

00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:54,059
know that we've actually solved for now

00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:57,299
I think that the only hurdle that I've

00:36:54,059 --> 00:37:00,059
seen I've got a a very highly

00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:02,880
distributed team which is I believe

00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:04,799
highly performant as well the only thing

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,670
you need to invest in war is the network

00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:07,859
because you've got a good quality

00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,270
network and you've got the right tools

00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,670
we're using the right tracker

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:13,680
you've got the backlog sorted we have

00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:16,470
our IP MS we have our red rose we have

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:29,490
paring remote paring it works you need

00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:31,140
artisanal internet well I mean you know

00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,630
I would joke about our two little

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:37,740
containers too so you know there's very

00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:39,720
game so we get about 5 10 min five

00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,369
minutes left really to you know for some

00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,630
last questions anyone have any other

00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:46,049
questions out there I want to make sure

00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:52,680
that there's one last pancake here it's

00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:54,960
a little bit broken up been disrupted we

00:37:52,680 --> 00:38:00,059
got a question in the back all right

00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,970
I am from the artisanal company if you

00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:05,250
guys haven't figured that out so we love

00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,440
Cloud Foundry and with newer

00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,539
technologies like container networking

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,539
there that brings a lot of challenges

00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:16,309
with security and PCI compliance which

00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:20,700
you know we are running into enforcing

00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:23,220
security policies at at the top layer

00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,440
where the infrastructure folks control

00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,420
it or do we enforce it at the container

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,250
layer you know the lots of questions

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,690
what are you what are your guys views

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,580
about

00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:34,410
how security is gonna go with all these

00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,150
new features which enable a lot of

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,400
internal communication but creates a

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:42,390
nightmare for people who are managing

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:47,190
the infrastructure Wow

00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:50,300
what a question so security and in

00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:53,040
particular securing networks is is

00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,690
something that I don't believe there's a

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,570
particularly short cut for yeah I think

00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,310
we love the fact that the the level of

00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:02,010
security we get inherently within the

00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:04,410
Cloud Foundry platform helps us but in

00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:07,020
particular for an organization like Isis

00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:09,750
where we will manage they Cloud Foundry

00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:11,760
for an organization on-premise off

00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,170
premise on a public or private cloud

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,570
you still need when you're doing that

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,010
deployment of a Cloud Foundry and the

00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,780
applications that you hope your

00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,520
customers going to continue to build an

00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,780
accelerated way on the platform you need

00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,300
to make sure that networking

00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,710
capabilities right and in particular

00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,870
that one of the things that we take

00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,580
really seriously is we have to manage

00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:32,490
that platform on our customers behalf

00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:34,590
and so we spend a significant amount of

00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,300
time of course working with government

00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,310
organizations and very large scale

00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,820
fortune 500 or group companies as well

00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:43,560
where we have to do regular audits but

00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,840
we've also trust in the community

00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,250
continuously to help do the great work

00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,650
they're doing at a moment about the

00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:51,360
regular patching identification of any

00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,720
CVS and what we've seen in particular

00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,700
because of the size of the community now

00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,440
it's is wonderful how quickly things are

00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,090
getting done so I think it's what as one

00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,610
of the reasons why there's a massive

00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:05,040
increase in adoption bring parallel to

00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:07,170
that we're seeing a lot of issues around

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,490
ownership in the data particularly in

00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,030
the healthcare so it's not only the

00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:15,930
permissions but once that gets out there

00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:17,460
you know who owns that you know set of

00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,900
markers that they found in the DNA

00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,180
sequences and there's a for-profit

00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,430
company out there making benefit off of

00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,410
data that was brought out from others so

00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:27,000
along with just simply the you know the

00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:29,340
security of the data we're looking at a

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,200
lot of companies where they want to keep

00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,990
it in-house behind their firewall

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,040
because to them it's a it's an IPS F and

00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:38,010
again it's something that's a work in

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,720
progress that that's happening but I'll

00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,490
add in the to your theme of

00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,640
transformation I think we're also in the

00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,529
midst of

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,539
of revisiting what we are assumptions

00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:48,640
around security compliance network

00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:50,220
architecture as we as we think about

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,349
abstraction layers and we think about

00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:55,359
deployment and even micro services and

00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:57,400
what does that mean I think there's also

00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,960
an opportunity for us to figure out

00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,480
different ways of approaching that and

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,640
moving away from the traditional

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:07,180
framework that exists in for example in

00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,710
PCI DSS v3 there's a lot of assumptions

00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,329
and compensating controls you need to

00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,589
interject in order to accommodate the

00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:14,019
fact that it doesn't even recognize that

00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:15,700
in containers so figuring out how we

00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:17,260
shift the paradigm a little bit as well

00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,109
but that's one of the reasons why we're

00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,329
working with with cloud soft because the

00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:24,789
service broker technology that they have

00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:26,799
allows us to have a consistency in the

00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:28,539
way that we're addressing and accessing

00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:31,180
the data and standardized way which we

00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:33,240
know is secure and fully compatible with

00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,010
the certified platforms that we run

00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,339
Chris any last thoughts yeah so I think

00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:42,250
you know Jason actually I think really

00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:43,809
gave the the exactly the right message

00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,000
because and it is it's all about

00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:47,890
continuous improvement it's about you

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,099
know many eyes make shallow bugs the

00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:52,900
fact that we're constantly sort of

00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:54,549
retesting this you know thoroughly it's

00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,710
all being test-driven in terms of cloud

00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:58,089
foundry you know that you have a number

00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,619
of people that are scrutinized the code

00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:01,660
is there for anybody to see you know

00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:03,609
that those those types of bugs will be

00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:07,359
will be sussed out I think the

00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:10,299
networking complexities are are going to

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:13,839
require not just the technology aspects

00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:16,450
of things but moving the needle on the

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:19,839
regulatory and other compliance measures

00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:22,059
because as we just said those were

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,420
developed for yesteryear for a different

00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:27,700
world right and and so we have to evolve

00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,710
those and they have to be transformed

00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,430
just as we're tected as we're being

00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:35,410
transformed by the underlying technology

00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:38,680
and that's a wrap hey guys thanks so

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:40,809
much for for joining us on the panel ABI

00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,759
Adam Brian Chris thank you very much for

00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:44,920
participation thank you all for joining

00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:46,720
us at the pancake breakfast and we'll

00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,860
hope to see you soon bye-bye

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,150
[Applause]

00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:54,430
and I just again want to thank Cloud

00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,410
Foundry and cloud soft for sponsoring

00:42:54,430 --> 00:43:00,030
the breakfast and being so generous here

00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:00,030
