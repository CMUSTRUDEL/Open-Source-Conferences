Description: 
	Launching the Next Generation Satellite Ground System on Cloud Foundry and Microservices – One Year Later - Michael Weirzbinski, DigitalGlobe; Mike Waters, DigitalGlobe; & Steve Wall, ECS Team

Last year at Cloud Foundry Summit, DigitalGlobe presented its rationale, plans, and early experience in the use of Cloud Foundry as the basis of its next generation Ground System. It’s now a year later, and we are in the midst of realizing that vision – culminating in a launch of DigitalGlobe’s latest satellite, WorldView-4, later this year. 

This presentation describes the discoveries that we’ve made in scaling up a major development effort running on top of Cloud Foundry. It includes discussion of our current environment as well as how we have overcome both technical and cultural challenges along the way. Finally, we’ll include a discussion of the how our view of Cloud Foundry, microservices, and related infrastructure have evolved over the last year.
