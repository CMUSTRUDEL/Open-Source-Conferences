hi everyone welcome to the cloud foundry

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,600
community advisory board meeting for

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,840
october 28 2020.

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,920
um we're going to skip over the cff

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,000
highlights and updates the cloud foundry

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,200
foundation staff worked really hard to

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
give us a great

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,279
summit virtual summit last week i'd like

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,359
to thank them all for

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,480
for that work um some great

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,240
presentations

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,920
uh they're i noticed they're coming up

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,519
on youtube now so if you have if you

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,240
want to take a look at them and share

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,840
them

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,119
to people who who didn't attend the

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,239
summit i think that's probably a good

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,680
thing to do

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,160
um uh again thank you cf

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,920
for doing and the cff staff for doing

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,360
great great work

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,760
i thought i saw eric

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,719
uh mom on our attendee list eric are you

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,719
here and would you like to

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,800
go over the pmc updates for uh runtime

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,079
yeah i'm happy to got a got a nice set

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,680
of updates here

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,000
um so uh the cli team has released what

00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,359
i

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,440
think is intended to be the final

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,199
version of the v6 cli with

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,880
a couple of fixes in it so that's 6.53

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,360
and so they'll be focusing on the v7

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,520
versions after that

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,560
and then of course we've got release

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,000
integration with

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,040
uh the release of cf gates version 1.0

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,200
around summit so congratulations to all

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,159
of them on that milestone

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,759
and then not to be outdone qcf has some

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,759
other

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,600
significant releases as minor updates in

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,119
v2 i know they've gotten some really

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,920
nice scaling configuration in

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,200
to 2.5 and some more configurability

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,759
around the irony service account

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,759
in two secs

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,240
for some of the component teams uh

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,759
cappy's uh finished up their work

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,600
to move the application bit packages

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
into the oci image registry when they're

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,759
using kpac and cf for gates

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,759
and i know they've been working on some

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,040
scaling improvements

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,479
especially with some of the feedback

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,119
that we've gotten from the sap folks

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,399
that have been

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,119
testing cf for gates at scale um

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,880
irini they've just started some work uh

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,920
around spiking on sidecar support

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,520
but i think they're also thinking a

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,119
little bit more about various other

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,959
extensibility mechanisms

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,400
and how to support those networking has

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,560
been

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,520
doing some work to add optional support

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
for other ingress

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,440
controllers and mechanisms on kubernetes

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,160
starting with contour

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,800
so we're thinking that this is looking

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,720
like a

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,959
potentially lighter weight option for

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,400
ingress than istio which is very

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,680
feature-rich but also heavy weight

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,920
sometimes a little difficult to wrangle

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,560
so this is probably going to be more

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,680
attractive

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,480
for smaller or test installations of cf

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,000
for case

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,000
um then they're also starting to look

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,519
into some of the app to app features

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,360
and how they can start supporting those

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,720
on top of kubernetes

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,239
uh and then login metrics they've

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,599
continued to work on log cache

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,560
performance and scalability i think

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,400
they've

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,160
delivered some improvements there but

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,640
they're still hard at work there

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,599
and jesse weaver the project lead for

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,800
that team uh

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,440
has been putting together a github

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
project on the staff gates logging repo

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,640
to reflect some of the roadmap

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,560
so thanks uh those are some of the

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,680
highlights happy to answer

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,000
a couple quick questions too great now i

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,120
did want to ask about the cli

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,239
v6 release i know a lot of us still rely

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,879
on the v2 api for for many reasons uh do

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,519
they still

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,760
intend on releasing patches for that for

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,599
the foreseeable future i think so yeah i

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,879
i assume that if there's any security

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,599
issues um

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,640
or uh significant bugs to correct then

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,840
they would have patch releases for that

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,120
cool thank you uh have we got anyone

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,560
from the bosch team

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
uh who can give us a quick update

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,080
not uh i don't see anyone we did have

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,680
a uh an extensions pmc meeting it was uh

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,000
sparsely attended but we got a couple

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,040
updates uh stratos 4-2

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,720
was announced at the cf summit

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:04,319
the uh big news there amongst a lot of

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,360
other improvements and extension point

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,879
refactoring was the donation or the

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,799
contribution of the

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,280
kubernetes and helm support stratos

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,239
in susa stratos to the upstream stratos

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
for two

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,680
so now uh everyone get has access to all

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,199
of the

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,040
um kubernetes features and

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,440
functionality as well as a nice

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,160
web helm client for installing things to

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,320
those kubernetes

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,560
uh kubernetes endpoints that you connect

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,080
to just like the cfn points you can

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,960
specify multiple ones and

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:46,160
uh and deploy things to to more than one

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,320
uh uh kubernetes endpoint uh

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,440
i don't want to attempt to summarize the

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,400
uh the

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,320
multi-apps update i got uh suffice to

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,800
say that there were a couple of new

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,800
features

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,039
multiple you can specify multiple

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,000
instances of one on the same mta in a

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,520
single cloud foundry space

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,199
you can use the service broker parameter

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,160
to specify which broker to use for

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,240
service creation

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,520
that's for if you've got uh duplicate

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,720
service offerings from two different

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,080
brokers

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,000
uh and then there's a whole bunch of

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,120
changes and bug fixes uh

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,440
that are in the notes from the last uh

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,440
uh cf extensions meeting which of course

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,000
are are on the in the github repository

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,520
with all the other

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,680
things uh i will amend

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,120
these notes if i get any uh late

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,919
additions to the

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,759
the extensions pmc updates from all

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,000
around

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,600
but um the real reason we're we're

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,440
meeting today because we're of course

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
one week out from our normal cadence we

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,400
wanted to

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
to give room to uh the diversity

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,039
conversation

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,280
last week at cf summit we didn't want to

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
collide with that but we rescheduled

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,080
because there were a couple

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,960
of community projects that people wanted

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,280
to present

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,960
one of which i don't think was presented

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,639
at summit and the other one

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:06,000
that we wanted a do-over uh

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,479
have we got someone here for

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,280
cf protect we do indeed troy

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,560
okay james do you want to take it away

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,360
yeah sure

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,840
i'll take it away i don't have slides um

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,280
i

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,199
really have barely have a demo my demo

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,039
infrastructure blew up this morning

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,319
i think i've managed to to bring it back

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,600
from the brink because it is a data

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,319
protection solution

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,360
uh which is what it specializes in so cf

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,400
protect

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,240
is a merge integration of shield

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,160
cloud.io which is a sas

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,639
backup solution based on shield open

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,120
source uh that stark and wayne launched

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,080
back in i think august

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,880
which gives you on-demand access to a

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,080
shield cloud

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,440
outside of your infrastructure for a

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,560
monthly fee

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,440
the the cf protect bit is really a

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,120
plug-in

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,960
for the cfcli that looks through

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,520
vcap services for any given application

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,360
and heuristically tries to determine if

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,360
there's any services that look

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,039
interesting or that look like they might

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
have persistent data

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,319
and then it goes off and it configures

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,599
shield the correct way with the right

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,840
plugins and the right

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,000
credentials based on your service binds

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,880
and the end points and the the database

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,080
names and

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,639
and other things the the

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,840
goal in putting this project together

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,840
was to make

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,000
data protection inside of cloud foundry

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,160
as simple as application deployment

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,919
inside of cloud foundry uh the big

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,960
strength we see with cloud foundry is cf

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,280
push

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,599
not a big surprise to anybody on this

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,880
call but cf push being able to go from

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,879
code to running app

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,960
is still pretty groundbreaking even in

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,800
this day and age of kubernetes and

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,479
and containerization everywhere we'd

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,919
like to do the same for data protection

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:59,599
so i'm going to go ahead and

00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:03,840
share my screen there's the button

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,840
all right can everybody see

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
my terminal

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,199
yes indeed excellent uh

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,639
so i'm going to start with i'm using pws

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,319
uh we actually started this project

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,759
because we got the eol announcements for

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,599
pws

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,759
and we needed to get our stuff off of

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,160
pws and the easiest way we could do that

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,680
was

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,319
shield so i have in uh in our

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,240
pws instance i have this app that i

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,479
wrote called to do

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,080
it's just a small to do application it's

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,719
a single list with a bunch of items that

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,560
have an on

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,200
a completed or not completed state and

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,200
the data is all stored in a database

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,519
uh it looks like this it's very um

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,519
very minimalistic uh and what we're

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,680
gonna do is we're gonna run a protection

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,920
against it

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,800
so i also have as you can see look at

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,600
the services

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,519
i went ahead and i got a clear db uh the

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,560
free plan out of pws this is just a

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,880
mysql

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,080
um app direct instance it's just out in

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,080
the cloud somewhere

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,240
and if i look at that service i could

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
go out and i can use their dashboard i

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,959
can run their backups

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,519
i can also look at the bindings for the

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,720
app

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,040
so i can look at the environment

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,880
variables for my to-do app

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,320
which that service is bound to

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,399
and i could find my

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,839
credentials right my host name the

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,920
database name

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,680
uh what user to log in i could set all

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,440
this stuff up myself

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,519
in shield or in any other backup

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,720
solution but i'm lazy

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,480
and what i want to do is i want to have

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,480
cf do that for me

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,480
real quick i'm going to flip over to

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,440
this tmux pane which shows me my

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,880
shield instance i have targeted my

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
shield cloud instance already

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,920
with shield api and shield login and all

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,160
that stuff

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,440
and i have a couple of things spinning

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,320
this migration target's going to be

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
interesting because

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,680
what we're actually going to do instead

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,000
of doing a backup and a restore is we're

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
going to

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,040
back up the data in the to-do app and

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,480
we're going to push it to

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,480
another mysql database as a means of

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,240
shoving data from one system to another

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,519
for for app migration purposes

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,600
or for testing or for auditing purposes

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,200
where you might need a full data set

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,120
copy from production into another

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,320
environment so

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,920
we're going to start with cf protect

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,440
inside my environment i have a couple of

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,000
environment variables that tell the

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,160
cfcli plug or the cf protect

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,120
plug-in for the cfcli how to talk to

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,600
shield

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,480
and how i want my backup for this app to

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
be done

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,920
as far as what agent but for the most

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,800
part we run cf protect

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,000
we remember to put the app name in and

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,120
the plugin looks

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,600
through and says hey i found this to do

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,000
db looks like it might be my sequel

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
and it pulls that off by looking at a

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,079
combination of tags

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,680
and the instance binding credentials so

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,839
my sql in pws

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,880
presents a specific way a separate set

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,399
of tags

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,320
uh it's actually tagged mysql

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,320
and a specific set of credentials that

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,800
we can pull from so here it's pulling

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,079
the cleardb.com hostname the port

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,640
the database and the username and

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,920
password it then goes out to shield

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:23,440
and it creates a new target named after

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,360
uh org space app and service name

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,079
and then it creates a daily job that is

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,760
paused and if i flip back over to the

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,320
browser

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:37,040
you'll see that this is now extent

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,880
make zoom a little smaller there we go

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,600
uh we have this thing it came in it is

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,040
paused

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
uh so one of the things we did in the

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,839
design for cf protect is

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,760
we we create a daily job but we don't

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,000
turn it on so that you have a final

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,959
review step to go hey this is you know i

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,519
want this to run

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,519
daily at 4am or i don't and i want to go

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,519
in and change it

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,760
but all my stuff is here right all of

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,800
the things that i need to figure out

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,399
i picked a specific agent for this

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,040
uh so we're going to go ahead and we're

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,959
going to manually run this

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,440
this backup because i don't want to

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,519
unpause it

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,760
and we can look through the tag the task

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,760
log it it connected out

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,440
to there it complained about password on

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,639
command line but it did go off and build

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,120
an archive

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,320
and that archive shows up right here

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,480
with this uid

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,079
is about 2.7 k which is about right

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,959
given that the to-do apps database is

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,959
very small

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,639
and if i wanted to i could restore this

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,760
back but what i'm going to do

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,160
is i'm going to go out and we're going

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,560
to look at my sql running somewhere else

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,720
specifically i put a docker compose

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,519
recipe together this morning

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,880
because my normal database was out of

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,959
disk space i think

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,320
so we're going to pop into this cf

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,040
protect db1 instance

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,680
we're going to run mysql as the root

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,519
user

00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,399
with the demo password

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,120
and there's nothing in this database so

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,240
if i do a show

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,440
databases that's just the stock standard

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,440
mariadb

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
uh loadout my sequel the performance

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
scheme and the info schema

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,240
the configuration for this is already in

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,600
shield so if i go look

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,519
here at targets

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,120
i have a target called migration target

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,000
that is that and it's running under a

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,079
different agent

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
so we're gonna grab that archive and

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,000
we're gonna say

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
restore the archive and i'm gonna cheat

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and i'm gonna steal

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,120
the uuid from here we're gonna say

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,160
restore that archive

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,160
to the migration target

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,000
and if we go back to data systems and we

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,920
go to migration target

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,199
we should have a manual restore that was

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,639
yep 11 16

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,880
that's our restore so that's

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,440
going through and doing all the things

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,519
and if we look back now at the

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,519
mysql databases

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,839
we now have the ad29e

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,160
database which is the database that

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,279
clear db set up for us so i can pull

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,440
this i can

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,639
run reports against this i can actually

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,959
move the to do

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,399
app off of pws either onto another cloud

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,920
foundry by restoring

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,440
to a similarly cf-protected database

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,720
instance in a different

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,480
cloud foundry i can move it to

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,360
kubernetes i can run it in docker

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,880
compose

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,959
i can do a whole bunch with it and and

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,160
i think we think that that was a fairly

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,240
painless uh

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,240
setup for doing data protection

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,120
and that's that's kind of it uh it's

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,560
data protection is really hard to demo

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,040
because if it works

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
nothing it works catastrophic happens

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,320
right

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,880
that is amazing that is really really

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,880
really useful

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,560
case in point i just want to

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,959
re-emphasize or emphasize that

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,480
when we've gotten noticed that uh pws

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,560
was end of lifeing

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,519
uh we we stood up our own cloud foundry

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,000
elsewhere and

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,440
we literally used cf protect to migrate

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
the data services that's right jane's

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,079
right

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
yeah yeah we used this to move our own

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,360
stuff because we needed to

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,680
right now the state of the project it is

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,320
on github github.com

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,920
let me actually go share screen and

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,600
we'll go look at github

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,760
it is out here in the shield cloud org

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,199
cdf protect you can download this the

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,399
readme has all the instructions for

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,680
installing this

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:35,360
um we actually are running our own uh

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,199
cli plug-in repository this one

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,560
that you can use to install the official

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,000
way if you don't want to build software

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,720
on your own machine

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,839
it's a fairly rudimentary version of the

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,519
plugin

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,000
right now we're only supporting my sql

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,040
and postgres and they only work if these

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,160
are the

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,600
credentials and the tags um we're

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
planning because this is heuristic right

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,320
it's looking at the the vcap services

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,600
uh buying the uh environment variable

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,199
and kind of picking and choosing what

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,759
makes sense to back up and how to back

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,440
it up

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,120
uh so if there's anyone out there that

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,639
wants to give this a go i

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,480
strongly recommend trying it in a

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,720
non-production environment first as i do

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,800
with all data protection software

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,800
and if there are services that you have

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,320
access to that you would you know we

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,759
know how to back them up but the cf

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,680
protect plug-in doesn't please

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,279
feel free to open a github issue with

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,199
details about the service

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,959
uh the cf protect plug-in only gets

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,440
better as we add support

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,680
for additional catalog services

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,360
i have a question uh is there a

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,240
server-side component to shield that

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,120
runs in cloud foundry

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,920
no not for the cf protect stuff uh the

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,920
shield cloud is is

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,920
shieldcloud.io is a sas offering

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,320
okay um so you would you sign up for

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,440
that and then it uses that as the

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,560
endpoints

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,160
i was just wondering about um

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,000
uh cloud foundries that that don't have

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,839
public endpoints for the databases that

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,199
you're you're yes

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,640
so that's where the agent comes in um

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,400
i i kind of cheated uh there is another

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,400
component that you can run

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,640
inside your infrastructure that provides

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,079
your agent implementation because what's

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,520
out on the public cloud is really the

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,839
orchestrator

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,559
and anywhere you can run a docker

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,480
container

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,839
you can or or you can run just a

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,959
straight uh like

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,160
we support ubuntu vms and centos vms uh

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,160
and just straight up installation i

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,559
don't believe we have a bosch release

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
um but we do have the docker image that

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,360
you can run on top of containers bosch

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,039
release and that spins up a little piece

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,440
of software that actually ssh is

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,120
outward from your infrastructure so it

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,880
transits all the nat gateways and

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,799
firewalls and everything else

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,000
and goes out to a public endpoint and

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,440
then from there

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,919
carries out the command says oh it's

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,280
time to do this backup okay great

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,720
and then um works that out to the public

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,760
storage and all that stuff could you run

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,200
that container

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,080
uh with uh docker diego or diego docker

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,080
feature

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,480
you probably could i wouldn't have a

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,080
port i don't know if diego would be

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,679
problematic from

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,760
this isn't really alive because it

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,600
doesn't listen for any traffic it's an

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,320
outbound only thing

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,240
but it is a native oci image that's

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,520
available on docker hub and

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,880
there's a couple different flavors

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,960
depending on what you want to back up

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,240
with it so there's straight shield cloud

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
uh we've actually got a blog post that

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,919
i'll be pushing out today to the

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,679
showcase.io website that details how the

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,720
docker image is put together and how one

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,880
might use

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
extend and otherwise integrate it into

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,120
your environment

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,919
so cool this is really really awesome

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,160
any more some questions i think this is

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,160
uh

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,440
long long needed uh i there are probably

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,600
uh things in bosch backup and restore

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,600
that that do similar stuff

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,120
uh but this is a great way for end users

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,600
to be able to get at their data

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,039
in an organized way any plans for

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,080
expanding the number of services that

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,080
you support

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,760
oh 100 we just have to work our way

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,000
through the catalog as wayne pointed out

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,400
this came about because we needed to do

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,480
some

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,320
data migration yeah uh and we already

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,480
had all the data pipes bits in

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,480
shields so we said hey this this could

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,039
work we have all the parts now let's do

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,160
this

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,440
uh but yeah as we as we work through our

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,720
own services layer

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,160
and and other clouds um as they go eol

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,440
i think swisscom was one we were trying

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,400
to get into to see if we could play

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,480
around there

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,480
um definitely it's mostly about

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,880
understanding the tags

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,480
and how to wire the because the app

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,320
already has access to all of its data

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,320
right otherwise the service doesn't work

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,400
so all we need to do is get shield the

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,160
access in the shield format

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,600
for the given plugin and it should be

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,120
able to do what it needs to do

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:45,039
so and on the shields project

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,320
github site the the shield repo

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,400
it lists all of the things that are

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,160
supported and you can in the cf protect

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,720
one yes and as we add more we'll add

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,480
more there

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,400
it is important to point out that shield

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,039
project and github and shield project

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,880
dot io is the open core base

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,400
and shield cloud and github and shield

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,280
cloud that i o is the sas

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,880
offering right um right now cf protect

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,200
only works with shield cloud

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,400
that's only because that's what we have

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,640
what we had access to

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,159
and and a desire to move quickly uh

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,080
there's no reason it can't do

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,600
other shields uh it's just not been a

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,600
huge priority but it will be

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,880
as people start to adopt this thing

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,320
outside so

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,039
cool so i see you've got uh file system

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,720
postgres mysql and then some things on

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,240
the presumably on the roadmap extra

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,360
backup cassandra console

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,039
xcd those are all currently

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,159
supported by the agent we just don't

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,440
have um

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,840
the services in cf protect configured

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
yet

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,200
right shield knows how to back all that

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,280
stuff up the trick with cf protect is

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,440
teaching the cfcli plug-in

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,960
for shield how to translate the service

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,039
binding into a configuration for shields

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,039
this is just a bunch of glue code really

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,039
that that makes this all work

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,880
so that the cf protect is the only

00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,400
command you really need

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,039
uh to get that configuration and

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,480
is that a that's a standalone binary or

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,200
a or a plug-in for

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,120
cf client it's a plug-in for cfcli and

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,039
we are running our own plug-in repo so

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,720
you can just add the repository

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,240
and then do a cf install plug-in and

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,600
away you go

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,880
awesome that is so cool

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,440
all right that's gonna be a hard act to

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,919
follow but uh we do have uh thanks so

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,640
much

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,440
uh james for presenting again any time

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,600
always good

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,840
content uh if i can just take a look at

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,360
my agenda today

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,320
uh any questions i asked a few questions

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,360
there could be more

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,760
out there uh james is this calls can be

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,679
used

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,320
to migrate from um from cf whatever to

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,120
cf

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,760
to kate's and cf the pcf and stuff like

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,080
that as well

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,080
yep in fact i've got a whole series of

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,360
content talking about using

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,679
um cf protect in vm based cloud foundry

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,960
to migrate to apps migrate the data for

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,880
the apps that you've already see i've

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,520
pushed over to your new shiny cf for

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,440
case

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,799
we're trying to make the data portable

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,120
in the same way that right now the

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,960
application code is portable

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,280
not to necessarily make the state state

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,720
list but as close as we can get

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:20,480
thank you anytime norm

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,480
anytime yeah and i'll just uh um

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,480
a half a question but it should be

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,080
possible for people who

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,880
have data right now um to point uh

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,919
shield and shield cloud at their data

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,679
with the

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,840
shield ui and api yeah just to

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,760
you know do a practice run there while

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,640
the the plug-in the cf

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,080
protect plug-in um is being updated to

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,200

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,760
nice because then you can kind of have a

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,159
look at if there's

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,080

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,400
little

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,279
uh problem with communication they were

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,320
going to

for k-8s um but

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,520
uh there was a time job there was a time

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,440
zone there was a time jump

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,760
they might not be uh they might not be

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,039

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,640
hearing some of the rumblings

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,919
we do have some of the bionic stem cell

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,840
stuff progressing so um

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,120
i think there has been some

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,960

it's not released it's just being looked

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,120
at and tested and whatnot

00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,159
um but i think

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,600
yeah that's uh

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,520
that's fine yep bionic stem cell stuff

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,440
is progressing i added some notes

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,679
uh is anyone from sap here yet

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,679

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,720
that

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,760
uh now especially since we just made

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,880

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:33,039
uh is actually one of the the

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:36,480

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,559
question

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,840
um i'm wondering if anybody has looked

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,520
into

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,000
what scaling for cube cf looks like

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,840
as far as can i run 50 000 application

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,120
instances on this thing

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,559
um if there's anything out there about

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,039
that

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,679
we owe that to the community and i know

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,559
that

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,640
ibm has been uh doing a lot of

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,000
scalability testing of course qcf is a

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,919
big part of their plans

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,279
sure uh and they are running it at

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,480
larger they they

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,120
have instances that are running at

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,559
larger scale um

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,120
i have somebody on the cube cf team

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,240
uh with a with an item for that but i

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,200
don't know the status

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,480
so why don't i take an uh note to

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,320
provide an update for that

00:28:52,480 --> 00:29:00,000
in the next um probably in the next

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,480

sensitive question uh for for

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,640
research purposes for clients based on

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,520
that question

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,480

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,919
yeah i popped that question in that

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,399
