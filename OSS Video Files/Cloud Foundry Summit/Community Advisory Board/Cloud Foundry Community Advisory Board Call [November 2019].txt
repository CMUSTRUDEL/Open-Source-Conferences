okay so you're recording thank you

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,780
actually as I mentioned in an email

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:14,639
there is no there are no talks with

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:17,850
their talks so we'll just go through the

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,650
iodized as we usually do and then just

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,090
jump into a discussion one of the things

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,570
that I kind of prepped is a couple

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,840
questions about the top quality format

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,520
you know the frequency the leadership so

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,230
if you can think about those things and

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,570
if you have any other questions then

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,290
maybe can jump to them I usually did a

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,450
survey and I will do one again but since

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,219
you know we didn't have any talk today I

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,649
figured at least the folks that are

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:51,420
joining maybe we can expect with that

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,309
and so it goes okay so with that we'll

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,940
go through the normal things that we

00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:05,640
usually do with run time extension so

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:09,210
sweat eyes here face water updates for

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,159
CFL for whatever we want to cover I'll

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,369
try to share my screen actually so that

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:19,710
way we'll see I didn't put in the notes

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,570
yet but I don't have a whole lot of

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,689
updates from the foundation it's just

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,299
the end of your work that we are focused

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,140
on end up your reporting end up here

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:34,189
kind of taking stock of the inventory

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,439
and everything but I'm also working on

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,909
doing a bunch of like is talking to a

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,659
bunch of folks in our community that

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:47,000
work or interact with app teams that

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:50,939
have not even looked at cloud foundry so

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,329
you will see at lists in the future how

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,390
we will evolve the content or at least

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,090
reshape the content on our website which

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:04,799
is a lot more useful for either your

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:07,680
teams or the end user teams to to use

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,739
and access when they're kind of still in

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,350
that education or education phase so

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,170
that is pretty much what we're doing

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:20,370
from the foundation said mostly the end

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:22,500
of your stuff just a quick note I know

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,270
this is a burning question for pretty

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,210
much everybody including ourselves out

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:32,700
here foundation we are so working out

00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:36,210
the details on summits so this TL DR is

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,060
there will be summits in 2020 but we're

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,240
figuring out how when where and what

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,380
form should it be I think everyone here

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,450
is aware that we are 2019 summits were a

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,910
lot more expensive I'm doing air quotes

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,840
here but expensive for the foundation

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,390
because we ended up spending a lot more

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,740
and we usually try to break even given

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,890
the sponsorships and everything but we

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,680
couldn't get that for 2019 summits so

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,290
we're trying to just plan in such a way

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,960
that 2020 summits will be extremely

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,600
useful for the community but not quite

00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,000
as expensive for the foundation so more

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,040
details to come as soon as we figure out

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,940
what is the ideal way or what is the

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,190
ideal form or shape of summit so stay

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,410
tuned for that but other than that I

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,610
don't have a whole lot to report I don't

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:32,100
think Chris I don't see Chris here but

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,500
if you have any I know the CLA stuff

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,330
should all be smooth and working now but

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:44,340
if you still have any issues feel free

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:46,170
to ping him on slack or email is the

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:53,160
foundation also considering maybe doing

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:56,270
online summits we have to spend money

00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:02,870
yet at a site where people come join

00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:05,730
like a virtual summit that we haven't

00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,070
explored yet because I know the

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,660
community values face-to-face presence

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,970
and interactions a whole lot so we're

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:16,049
looking at co-locating with any other

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:19,710
event so that is at least set of options

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:23,100
that we have on the table but if it's a

00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:24,870
virtual summit I would like to hear

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,790
either from you norm or

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,660
anyone else here how would it be

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:33,930
valuable like how can we structure a

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,360
virtual summit so that it still feels

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:42,150
like you're getting the same value out

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:44,040
of it as an in-person summit my feeling

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,770
would be you can have interactions with

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,979
the people talk to be more interactive

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,530
talks on topics and people can be

00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:54,600
sharing information at that point so I

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,950
could you know somebody has an interest

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:01,500
in let's say Bill packs updates and

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,180
stuff like that they get discussion

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,080
around that and what you do at your site

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,180
and how to maintain that type of stuff

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,110
so it would be different style of talks

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,820
where it's more people leading the

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,950
discussion more than anything else and

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,229
that you're meeting the people at that

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:22,770
point and then when you go off to these

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:25,470
other summits like Q Khan and other

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,090
places you can have meetups in there

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,510
where you get to meet people at that

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,180
point

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,700
so therefore the foundation would have

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,250
to spend a whole bunch of money on that

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,930
and it'll allow other gilling allow

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,270
things to be recorded automatically

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,389
right and people can see what's working

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,750
what the discussions are it's just an

00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:54,750
idea

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:57,210
okay that is helpful I I'll I'll talk to

00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,000
the team here as well I'm mainly chip

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,220
and ABI and Evan to see what they think

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,070
of it I think there are a lot of online

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,410
tools at least or organizations that can

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,660
help us host these virtual summits or

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,210
virtual conferences a lot more

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,830
effectively and efficiently so that's a

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,889
great suggestion I will I will

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:20,030
definitely I've made notes I'll I'll see

00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:23,430
if that is also something that is useful

00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:26,130
I know that some of the member

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,610
organizations also are looking into

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,410
hosting Cloud Foundry days which which

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,800
are like the day-long event stay long

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:37,890
Simon's one-day events at their region

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,730
so I still need to circle back and see

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,430
if they

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,150
there's anything but virtual semester a

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:49,800
good idea

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:52,110
thank you no yeah that could be and of

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,900
course you you're contemplating I mean I

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,560
love that idea too but just to lay it

00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:01,290
out out there your foundation is also

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:04,290
contemplating co-locating right with

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,570
other big conferences that point Center

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:10,860
task UConn sense you know we just talked

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:14,330
about it and in potentially reducing to

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:18,090
one is that also part of the discussions

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,500
yeah I think you've gone will is totally

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,740
not on the table at this as a

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:27,870
co-locating event because it's it's

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,430
fairly large and gathering focus or it

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,660
still will be equally expensive I think

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,250
it would be cheaper to host an

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,100
individual or under some it than to

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:38,070
co-located with cube con macaws

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,840
perspective we will not be there won't

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,610
be any difference which is why we're

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,100
looking at other events like yeah

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,050
there's member events and also there's

00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,380
open source event how open source summit

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,000
which is like the anchor Linux

00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,490
foundations event so we're kind of

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,730
looking at about options in that

00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:07,560
perspective okay okay any other

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:12,540
questions for Sorna correct so I guess

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:17,580
we'll switch to the project highlights

00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:19,380
we have Eric hey dr. max yeah give a

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,450
quick overview of some of the things

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,840
that the runtime teams have been working

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,610
on over the past month or so realest

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,590
integration they haven't released in UCF

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,960
deployments major version since major

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,670
version 12 but they have been producing

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,470
a lot of auto bumps with stem cell

00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:37,440
updates so they had mentioned that

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,630
automation falling into place recently

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,630
and that seems to be humming lis away

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,700
nicely one interesting thing from the

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,980
CLI team they've recently published a

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,350
versioning table that has different

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,810
categories of changes and what you would

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,560
expect like from a command change and

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,069
then the corresponding

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,529
a change a patch or a minor or whatever

00:08:55,069 --> 00:09:00,509
so I think that's nice guidance to see

00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:04,319
within the community around consistency

00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:06,240
and expectations around versioning a

00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:08,189
bunch of the component teams have been

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,829
making progress on deeper integration

00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:14,069
with kubernetes deployment models

00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:17,579
so in particular Irena released 1.0 as a

00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:19,829
stability milestone they consider their

00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:22,019
initial set of API is pretty stable at

00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:23,610
this point and so people can start

00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,699
building on them and rely on them to be

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:31,199
backwards compatible and then both the

00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:33,899
Cappy and UAA teams have been starting

00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:36,930
work more seriously around providing

00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:40,610
kids deployment artifacts from the teams

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,379
themselves and capys also been

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,660
simultaneously prioritizing work around

00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,160
integrating with the kpac resources to

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,879
take advantage of cloud native build

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,879
packs running at kubernetes and also

00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,079
networking they've been developing a new

00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,629
component that they're calling see if

00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:58,529
route sync to convey CF route

00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,930
information

00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:03,480
- esteem configuration for ingress

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,149
routing and so they have some initial

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,269
work on that and wonder if their repos

00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:11,370
that they're working to integrate with

00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:13,019
irony I think there's a there they're

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,790
working to adjust to a last-minute

00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,490
labeling change that the ireenie folks

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,269
made in terms of labels versus the label

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:24,480
selectors they need for the services and

00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:26,550
then i i'm also know that log readers

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,889
along been looking to close out the

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,809
deprecation timeline for the fire hose

00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:34,019
and they've recently provided some

00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:35,160
office files into CF deployment to a lot

00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,769
of people at least to test with that

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,620
configuration and to validate that they

00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:43,879
are have all of their integrations and

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,879
replacements back in place

00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,269
so I think that's about it in terms of

00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,930
highlights from the runtime PMC over the

00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:56,040
past month or so

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:58,620
alright thank you Eric so I think Morgan

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,680
for Bosch but I don't see anything from

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:10,920
him so maybe he'll update me later and

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:14,459
I'll update the agenda so for I'll stop

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,040
sharing my screen so for the extensions

00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,670
one of the things we did last month is

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:24,390
to go through and kind of clean up

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:27,329
basically figure out which projects you

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,360
know are still active as you know this

00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,110
is kind of like a playground

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,570
experimentation so there's a few

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:37,410
projects that you know after discussing

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,570
with owners maybe it makes sense for

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,370
them to move to attic so that concepts I

00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,540
started so if you go to the agenda

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:49,740
you'll see the list and then also links

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,839
to the active projects as far as their

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,970
updates there's there hasn't been much

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,339
so that's one of the things that I

00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,310
wanted to discuss in terms of the

00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:05,339
discussion later today after this I

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:07,589
guess is what to do with the process if

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,600
we want to change things and so on so in

00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:12,360
terms of extensions that's pretty much

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:17,149
where we are I don't know if you guys

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,149
have any questions for me or for Eric or

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,360
no okay

00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,850
so I guess this might be a very short

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,690
call the last thing I wanted to mention

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:37,050
is so I show my screen to show you that

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:39,810
those questions I think I mean I've been

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:42,839
running these for a few years now and

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:45,269
I'm happy to help but at some point it

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:52,500
might make sense to start looking at

00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:56,420
what to do next so let's go here so I

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,420
had a couple major questions about

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:06,180
exactly then though sharing the screen

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:09,330
of the catwalk right for 2020 so I think

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,130
one of the big questions is whether or

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:15,150
not the frequency that we have right now

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:19,140
which is monthly is is it's still useful

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:21,920
to people or should we change it I don't

00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,750
know if anybody has opinions on this

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,540
obviously the next one could be since

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,870
they're not as well attended as he used

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,330
to be we could always make an effort to

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:43,200
try to attract more people but he's also

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:45,750
probably people to go newt the the next

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,400
obvious thing is to maybe make them

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:59,520
quarterly so any thoughts on this or we

00:13:50,400 --> 00:14:01,589
keep them monthly no notice no I was

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,190
thinking maybe every other month or so

00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:07,860
was just always these things coming out

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:13,650
there won't be a heavy hit you know do

00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:15,209
it no monthly call yeah and then then if

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,940
that doesn't work then then move to

00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:19,740
quarterly but I do find it useful to

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,260
hear updates and what's going on in

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,320
different areas

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:28,050
okay assuming there's going to be some

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,660
more movement you know in the cadiz

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:34,470
world and foundry and stock integration

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:41,130
so I think start tracking people as you

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:42,510
get topics that people care about yeah

00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,660
that's a great idea

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,760
how do you think of that so yeah one of

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,400
the things part of why I'm asking those

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,150
questions because I'm gonna do a survey

00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,500
and I'm gonna try to see thank him

00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,060
queried a community-owned specifically

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,760
things like this so obviously you guys

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,400
can help me decide what those questions

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,329
are so if one of the question could be

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,890
if we change it every other month like

00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,990
you're suggesting or the week to

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,209
something like quarterly so excellent

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:16,089
thank you for that and

00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:20,329
the last thing is in terms of leadership

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:23,240
as I said I've been running these for a

00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:23,720
while and it might help to get some new

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,689
blood

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,339
so I was thinking whether or not it

00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:31,970
makes sense for me to sort of step down

00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:34,220
and offer it to other people so that's

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,009
also something out put on the agenda to

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:41,569
get folks that want to participate and

00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:47,929
want to take on that and hopefully step

00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:49,610
up and we can do a smooth transition you

00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:52,689
know so that's that those are the two

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,730
questions that I had I don't know if

00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:59,660
there's any comments on those or any

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:04,279
other questions comments how much work

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:07,550
does it take you to organize a cat call

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:10,639
they don't try to understand effort is

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:12,670
how much extra time is that you have to

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,949
keep up with stuff on it

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,949
it's a is that too bad you know

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,769
certainly not the unit then the top of

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,600
the things that I have to do you know

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:32,240
just for I haven't for couldn't see work

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:36,679
around different projects I think I

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:39,319
think the biggest the biggest work is to

00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,929
try to find those talks right and keep

00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:43,549
them interesting and obviously if it's

00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:46,579
somebody that you don't know then you

00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:48,619
know kind of get a preview of the talk

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:50,869
before or if you've seen it obviously

00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:53,360
that's easier like a YouTube video or

00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:56,869
something so it's it's it's not a lot of

00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,549
work I think the main thing is to is to

00:16:56,869 --> 00:17:04,819
be able to keep a beat going and find

00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:06,829
the talks like for instance this this

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:09,500
month I was hoping you really folks

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,539
would present but nobody got back to me

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,709
and I kind of figured well they didn't

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:15,799
get back to me and they've already

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,449
presented this year and plus all sorts

00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:20,360
of it that they just didn't have

00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:23,839
anything new so I could have pushed

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,980
coder but I figured you know it's the

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,750
last one maybe

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:31,310
it's best to just you know maybe

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:33,710
terminate early and and so on right but

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,480
like have you come here I could probably

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,570
find to it we talked said I could try to

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,460
invite so you know it's it's that kind

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,790
of thing it's it's constant you know

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:48,950
flow but it's not so much what you

00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:51,650
thinking apology right um I I am a

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:55,340
little bit I mean we'll talk to Brian

00:17:51,650 --> 00:18:01,100
and dr. Nick about it okay it could be

00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:02,660
really good at this so I all see dr.

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,420
Nick get the puck on so I could always

00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,610
pestering less he's any less he's in the

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,700
room with you know he's I don't know

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:14,230
with me but yesterday at Q code I spent

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,700
a fair amount of time with him not know

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:20,150
what I'm just thinking you know you need

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,540
some dynamic and you know like you are

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:26,630
like that to keep things going I

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:32,060
understand bring it over it'll get tired

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:34,010
right get worn out I mean that's one way

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,280
of saying and the other ways is that you

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,870
know it's always good to allow for the

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,350
fresh blood you know quote-unquote

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,240
because you know there'll be a bunch of

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:48,640
things that you will see that I don't or

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,710
anybody else writes comes to mind is I

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,750
see norms point as well to can

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,030
understand or to get a sense of the

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:59,330
amount of work that goes into this and

00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:02,270
also Max's point of view that we would

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:05,000
need fresh eyes or fresh blood into this

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,450
role how about maybe for the next few

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,680
calls

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,720
max you asked for warrant volunteers to

00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,210
just take ownership of that particular

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:19,220
called look not to take over as a cab

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:22,040
co-hosts or organizer for the future but

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,050
just individual calls so they can kind

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,570
of get a sense of what goes in and they

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:31,910
also get that code in court experience

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:34,400
of leading the call and then as we go

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:36,740
forward if that person repeatedly

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,850
volunteers or if that volunteer feels

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:42,710
like they can take ownership or

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:47,780
probably step up at which point you can

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:51,440
either co-host or co-organizer be a kind

00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,320
of passive backup yeah I mean that's

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,060
sounds reasonable

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,670
okay cool so Norma have you as a

00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:01,730
potential volunteer here so what I'll do

00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,010
is you know based on this discussion on

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,160
this any or the feedback comes in here

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:09,440
is to essentially you know as part of my

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,560
survey which I did you remember the past

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,910
two years I'll include a question on

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,700
this and then see if we get any

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,920
responses and of course if norm you're

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,470
one of the volunteers and then you know

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,360
give me some kind of thumbs up so I can

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:28,550
include you there and then for January

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,900
will not be school host and then you

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:35,810
know I'll still apply something in the

00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:37,550
culture things for anyone and I think if

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,140
it makes sense for you to mention it

00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,900
even in that question in the survey max

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,360
you can also mention that anyone from

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,160
the foundation can help them with

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,710
reaching out to folks as well like if

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,110
your if those volunteers are not able to

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:54,770
hear from the folks that they're trying

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:58,610
to reach out to and obviously you they

00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:00,680
will come to you first if you're busy or

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,990
if they're not responding to you as well

00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,330
even the foundation like any one of us

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,030
Chris myself or chip or any of us can

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:11,690
also kind of take that workload as well

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:14,510
share that workload and I'm glad you

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,610
mention this because one of the unsung

00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:19,130
heroes of the cup calls is somebody

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:22,220
that's here right now is Ashley from

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,800
stuck in Lane who has been very very

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:28,190
good at pretty much recording the cause

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,440
and also helping upload them in soon I

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:33,710
think send your link so you have to do

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,080
the work to get the file to the

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:39,590
foundation so it gets put on youtube you

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,120
know and of course you remember to start

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,300
the recording in Toronto Thank You

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,300
Ashley

00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:53,260
okay any other questions about Copco or

00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,700
in general

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:59,140
otherwise I'll be sending that survey

00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,810
probably in the next week I think next

00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,480
week is it's Thanksgiving in the u.s. so

00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,370
called later Monday or Tuesday or the

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,370
week after that and then I'll keep it

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:14,190
open until January so that way we get

00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:15,610
hopefully good amount of responses yes

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,640
sorry

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:25,240
something you already said but I just

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:28,540
see the I told her that I have a kiss

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:32,890
and blockhead I'm going to attic yeah I

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:38,050
wanted to have some insights but why it

00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:44,790
is so sure yeah I can tell you that them

00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:49,150
so for a backness the ASAP team has

00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:52,840
asked to go to a deck because internally

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:56,940
the at least for my understanding they

00:22:52,840 --> 00:23:00,180
had had some pressure to move to a

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,620
quote-unquote proprietary version and

00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,930
because they're using it's deeply

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:08,770
integrated with their internal system so

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:11,350
they couldn't keep going on supporting

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:14,770
the external the public version in their

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:18,220
version and then that IBM unfortunately

00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:23,320
and I have tried very hard on this we

00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:25,090
did exactly the same thing to me I'm not

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,000
happy about this but you know sometimes

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,020
things are outside of your control

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,150
that's what happened with the package

00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,220
but the project itself is still quite

00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,810
useful so if somebody wants to step up

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:40,140
that's a possibility

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:45,220
yeah they reached the version to that oh

00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:46,930
my stone are where were they they were

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,730
getting close to that so one of the main

00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:52,210
things on version 2 that always - it

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:55,240
increased performance and a series of

00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,920
updates to the API and and I think they

00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,620
got close to that the other thing also

00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,180
is that the abacus is written in Lucia's

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,880
and they try to

00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,730
that version $2 and go mm-hmm not

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,650
necessarily because it was gonna gain

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:11,560
performance but just as a prototype and

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,720
also to see if if it would increase the

00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:18,720
amount of contribution just because you

00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:21,490
know in carpentry schooling is in Sarnia

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,900
you know language and people most mostly

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:27,970
know but I I believe they kind of left

00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,920
that on the side I don't know one thing

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,880
I don't know and we could ask them is I

00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,470
don't really their internal projects got

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,670
you know basically was the goaline

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,290
version right I don't

00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:43,300
[Music]

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,340
okay yeah for blockhead for blockhead

00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,460
you know it's it's it's one of those

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,320
interesting projects it's it's like you

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,510
know we've seen this many times I'm sure

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,500
you have and I have in many of us here

00:24:52,510 --> 00:25:00,100
that things like technology such as you

00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:03,250
know blockchain they get these hypes you

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:05,530
know and then it kind of dies down I

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,660
mean obviously there's still quite a bit

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,030
of activities going on a blockchain we

00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,010
have an entire team and so on but the

00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:15,100
team at IBM that did the blockhead which

00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:18,460
is to integrate got chain with you know

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,980
closer to cross boundary the result were

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,070
yeah I'd worked but there wasn't a lot

00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:26,950
of interest at least in in that overlap

00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,790
of blockchain and cut foundry as we

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,160
anticipated

00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:34,360
so the project has been kind of like

00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:38,140
there and it's not there's no activities

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,450
and you know just to kind of maybe you

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,060
raise the concern so you know anybody

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,380
that wants to pick it up they kind of

00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,570
decided well maybe it makes sense

00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,700
because what we were trying to do for

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,560
the extension is just say well it's not

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,110
necessarily a failure but if a project

00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,420
is not active then maybe it makes sense

00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,190
to move it to an ad to attic and then

00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,800
you know if somebody wants to pick it up

00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:02,950
or clone it you know do whatever so

00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,240
that's what's happening it's not that we

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,340
will be interested it's just that the

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,910
community didn't there wasn't as much

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,910
interest as we had anticipated hmm

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,740
thank you for them sure and I can I mean

00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:21,640
especially since this this came from IBM

00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:25,850
I can connect you with the folks that

00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:29,480
led this email and then maybe if you

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:33,680
want to have further discussion ping me

00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:38,810
offline you know okay any other

00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:43,010
questions no all right well I give you

00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:45,110
back 30 minutes of your time and I think

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:49,310
you and have a happy holidays and then

00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:52,400
we'll talk again by email for the I

00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:53,720
guess for the survey and then the next

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,650
call will be in January

00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,650
