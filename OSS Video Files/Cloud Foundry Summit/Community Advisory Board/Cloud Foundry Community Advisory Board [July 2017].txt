yeah the same everywhere they're like

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,410

stealing their office fix and all the

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:32,550
best snacks do they have beer that's a

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,950
question always or is four o'clock here

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:40,649
I might have to investigate the answer

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,210
to that question I've got these air pods

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,890
in I'm thinking what the range is and if

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,550
I can make it to the fridge without them

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,570
going off was it was it worth all this

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,610
trouble to find them it's free bailer

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:59,219
free payment no I'm don't have other

00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:01,530
airports now that you mention it they're

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,239
actually pretty great I have to say and

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:09,540
the regular ones fall out of my ears

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:13,200
like constantly these ones are good I'm

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,210
skeptical there will be skeptical while

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,939
I continue to listen to the conference

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,060

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,230
tell all of our employees know their

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,690
location oh I see you're planning to go

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:42,050
to you were planning to do something

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:46,130
right no you're new eventually all right

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,130

all right let me text this to DK here

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,680
and then we'll get started

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,860
you

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,890
okay let's see all right Jules is back I

00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:28,069
think we have a good group so maybe we

00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:31,790
can get started we have about 17

00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:34,790
according to to zoom and I know it

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:37,099
Dmitry is joining interests excellent so

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,010
we'll have a good group all right so the

00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:41,870
agenda is not different from what we had

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,109
before except that at some point we'll

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,439
have towards the end we'll have one talk

00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:51,709
today and it's David savetti

00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:54,620
who's going to talk about CF deployment

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,980
do you have another talk well you got

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,269
coffee

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,549
okay wait I did I did come in to try to

00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,769
get another talk but my bad I did not

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:05,150
follow up on a few things so we just

00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,859
have one talk today so we'll just have

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:11,090
discussions but next week next time

00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:18,500
we'll have more including one by yours

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:22,370
truly myself so and we have Huey here so

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,550
excellent let's get started the first

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,500
thing I want to say is that for Cloud

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,520
Foundry all day chip is not going to be

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:33,080
able to join us he texts me and I was

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,370
asking about whether or not we had

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,520
updates for the summit in Europe and he

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,430
said nothing to share yet but I guess if

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,770
you I saw that there was a call for

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,220
participation so people that are

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:53,860
planning to to attend you can start

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:57,110
registering I believe the same food for

00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,169
contributors should be valid if it's not

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,729
let us know so I would say everybody

00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:05,060
that if you're planning to be there join

00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:07,400
I'll certainly be there and I know it

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,139
tons of other people joining it's gonna

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,139
be in Basel Switzerland

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,210
it's a city I visited actually this year

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:23,060
it's it's actually great city it's very

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:25,750
old and there's I guess I guess

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:30,889
difficult to say it's the Swiss city

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:32,280
very very safe and I enjoy it I don't

00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:40,950
know who else

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:47,639
have a thing to that the local

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:50,790
transportation they give you a pass it's

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,389
very nice yeah it's it's extremely well

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,910
organized in terms of moving around

00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:58,650
there is a tram and and of course you're

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,580
in Europe you can travel pretty much

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:05,100
anywhere and in this state you know in

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,660
the country and other countries so it's

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,160
I would highly recommend people I'm

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,030
actually spending a whole month and you

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:17,640
are going all over for IBM actually and

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:24,600
some vacation but so anyway try to go

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:26,400
really for IBM anyway I don't know if

00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:32,340
anybody else wants to mention anything

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:39,210
about summit looking forward to see you

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:42,840
yeah it's good to know we just got

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:48,330
married otherwise you would think that

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:51,570
there's anything wrong with all right so

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,190
so with that let's get to I guess

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:57,990
updates from the different teams

00:06:53,190 --> 00:07:00,870
I know Demetri needs to come here I

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,780
guess so he wants to go first so that he

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,610
can give us an update on Vash Demetri

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,200
you don't have to like go over status

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,390
mostly that question you get people

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:16,979
excited about trying the latest versions

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:20,669
of Bosch sure yeah so you've been hard

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:23,580
at work at cleaning up and polishing up

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,710
some of the credit features that's been

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,620
kind of ongoing in Toronto

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:31,140
I think we're next to this should this

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,030
should fix have a few you know things

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:37,169
that were found while using it in

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:40,979
production we've also been working of

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:45,600
course on the DNS functionality we put

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:47,580
quite a few pairs on it and we've been

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,900
getting pretty close to actually rolling

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:55,950
this out fully to pwas to kind of give

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,600
it a full production run test at the

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,220
same time we've kind of been chatting

00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,360
about with other teams like MySQL and

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,840
you know some of the other teams on the

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,140
floor to see what kind of features that

00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,990
we need to make sure are present in the

00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,390
DNS implementations such that it is very

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,100
convenient for the service brokers to

00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:20,820
return those DNS entries to the

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:23,070
applications so for example we've been

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:27,210
chatting about with my Scott thing about

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:29,760
leader for work random patterns what

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,740
else we've been doing this variety of

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,550
fixes in the director side we're also

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:38,550
right now working on a feature that's

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:40,410
marked as Aaron's three that's the

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:44,820
iteration on Aaron's that will allow

00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:48,360
them to run one day the service machines

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,640
as well as the errant machines so for

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,880
example if you have a broker you could

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,540
now collocate the register and register

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,700
Aaron's onto that broker or for example

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,620
if you have a interesting use case of

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,370
maybe collecting some debug information

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,410
or maybe promoting master to follower or

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,900
something like that those all could be

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,550
errands that run on the individual

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,570
machines instead of on a dedicated

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:17,460
machine so that gives us some additional

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:21,000
flexibility and potentially in certain

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,040
areas speed boost in terms of avoiding

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,740
to click create and they need the earth

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,740
machine that's not released yet but it

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:37,350
should be coming in a few weeks when we

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:39,060
publish in your boss release yep what

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,400
else that may be of interest here we've

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,250
kind of a child as a team about some of

00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,940
the upcoming work regarding cleaning up

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:50,460
some of the deploy flows you know some

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,950
you know we are when we're doing

00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,230
somebody creates and starts and stop it

00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,450
may try to look at other instances and

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,760
of course we don't like that so we want

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:02,970
to make what I call a deploys a lot more

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,590
granular or have at least ability to

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,680
make them granular such that if you're

00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:10,740
typing in borscht recreate it will never

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,930
for example look at another instance you

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,480
know if you only said I wanted to create

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,670
this particular instance so that should

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,770
just improve general deploy work clothes

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:23,490
and some of that is also tied in to

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:27,510
improving the main difficulties where we

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,910
can say you know upfront what kind of

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:35,060
changes will be happening to individual

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:37,680
instances yeah so that that's kind of a

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:41,450
high level areas that we've been working

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,970
on meanwhile I guess were also been

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:47,010
trying to take care of one of the

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,930
hardening things that we haven't done

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,840
stem cell yet since it was pretty big

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,670
what we call EU mask stem cell where we

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,190
change the default you must call you in

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,130
the stem cell and we've been kind of

00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:02,940
working with all kinds of other teams to

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:05,400
make sure that commonly used software

00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,070
that we install this Bosch isn't

00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,650
significantly affected so actually

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,440
chatting with garden team right before

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,690
this meeting was a good challenge

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:27,540
hopefully we'll see some progress in

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:37,290
that area overall your yeah don't think

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:39,870
I have anything else yet out for a

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,440
little bit so if you have questions

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,440
would you meet you

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:15,459
and since they declared their when not

00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:18,970
earlier than shuttle it'll be a judge so

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:20,709
if you're interested in voting on that

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:26,050
on the Ren Thank You Susan

00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:28,180
that'll be under neck meeting what what

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,760
else associate appointment is moving

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,370
along I don't know David Studies on the

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:40,800
line he will give an update yes like 15

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:44,170
minutes and Jules wanted you and

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:49,029
rebranding Jules if you wanted to talk

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:53,740
about that no new Jules if you're trying

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:56,889
to conquer did did I your team's a team

00:12:53,740 --> 00:13:01,209
means oh oh this is totally actually

00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:07,779
George's idea well okay I was gonna dump

00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:12,790
this on George yeah I so basically I

00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:15,190
think the garden the team wants to get

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,290
away from thinking of garden as a as a

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,000
noun right gardens a little bit of

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,970
glucose the basic lose the rest

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,130
assistant to run see I think a lot of

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,290
the actual value of garden is more about

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,360
containers right it's about containers

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,910
within the platform and how he can

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,170
exploit container technology in the

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,019
platform and I've been getting away from

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:38,980
that noun thinking of this bit of code

00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:41,769
that we all really care about is is a

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,570
helpful thing to do as I prefer we call

00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:49,480
garden container runtimes and George

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:52,209
who's the PM for groups has a similar

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,560
opinion about groups we should we should

00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:55,750
not really think about it as group

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,640
that's a bit of goods is really about

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,839
container file systems and properly

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,839
exploiting them in the platform

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:15,930
additionally there's been some an

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:18,060
investigation into convoy and sto and

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:21,100
Eric do you want to talk about about

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,209
about integrity

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,179
yeah so one

00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:27,790
thing that the Diego and routing teams

00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:29,800
will be starting pretty soon shannon

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:32,829
assured an update with this about this

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:36,189
on CF dev is doing some work to take

00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:38,199
advantage of the instance specific

00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:41,499
credentials that diego can now generate

00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:44,290
and using those to ensure greater

00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:47,259
integrity of routing between bragging

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,529
cures like to go router to obligation

00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:51,670
instances so they would have effectively

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:55,029
cryptographic proof that they're

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:57,639
connecting to the correct instance and

00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:00,399
this would potentially allow us to do

00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,459
things like increase or even eliminate

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,769
the burning threshold and the go router

00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:07,209
so then go routers even if they're

00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,929
disconnected or not receiving updates

00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:12,579
they be assured of always routing to the

00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:16,779
correct instances assuming that they can

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:18,879
connect to back ends you know there'd be

00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,689
no risk of any miss routing because we

00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,519
have math ensuring that that can't

00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:26,199
always trust mac so in terms of

00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,899
implementing that one one thing that

00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:32,740
we're looking at is having the platform

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:36,549
run an instance of this Envoy proxy for

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,379
a container and using that to host the

00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:41,490
instance specific credentials and deal

00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:43,959
with their rotation as they expire and

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:47,619
effectively expose that as an in

00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:50,589
container proxy feature in the platform

00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:52,360
and then there may be other features

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:54,579
that envoy presents that we could take

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,929
advantage of also in the buffer so it's

00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:59,529
looking like very interesting piece of

00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:02,410
technology to explore integrating into

00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,670
cloud foundry this apply to all yeah

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,009
that would be the idea so we'd have to

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,779
do something on Windows maybe we have as

00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,829
far as I know envoy doesn't run on

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:13,449
Windows at least yet although there's

00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:21,279
not any fundamental reason it wouldn't

00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:23,230
be able to to my knowledge miscellaneous

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:27,610
tuning slash hackery

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:31,619
to make it run service on Linux and so

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,619
it may not very well

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:42,990
vacation to see what what solutions make

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:45,370
sense for windows pretty much recently

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,020
if you reason be easy to get it to be a

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,430
static binary if we're going to try and

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,529
side load it or do we need to do

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,290
something funky like you know amount

00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:55,750
name space it's pretty much static it

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:59,140
has just a very few shared library

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,390
dependencies that I think any reasonable

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:07,089
Linux container would have those that's

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:08,470
all okay III guess I don't know if it's

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,380
a big concern but I guess the worry is

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,030
like if you've got the shared libraries

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:17,679
there's a danger that docker container

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:19,420
sort of shakes those out and makes your

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,010
envoy do things it shouldn't do

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,959
as long as we're not relying and

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,939
obscurity I guess that's fine it sounds

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:32,040
like we might do a minor security case

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:34,390
maybe it's not fine I mean I think

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:38,350
that's certainly one area to investigate

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:43,390
I don't think that we would rely on it

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:44,770
having any particularly trusted like

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:49,720
control plain information if it's

00:17:44,770 --> 00:18:05,550
running in the container it's probably

00:17:49,720 --> 00:18:10,170
fine yeah potentially serving for

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:18,730
solving for external app identity their

00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:21,190
apps to you know legacy or being able to

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:26,670
identify your app to firewalls that

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:28,990
expect a Nike okay so these are

00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:33,070
different kinds of things that were

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,880
interested in I'm also interested make

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:40,570
sure in general and the sensibility that

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:43,740
things like this would be beyond what

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:47,200
you can do now with looking at logs and

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:51,100
trying to figure out where absolutely

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:58,200
yes sir so you could enforce it in the

00:18:51,100 --> 00:19:01,150
run line method there's a lot of

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,140
discussion around you know could you put

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,610
an envoy over here in front of the

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:12,070
external database and then the young

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:14,620
boys work together it's your like ensure

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,800
that that communication path or you use

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:20,860
it as a proxy on to present a key

00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,140
externally there there's a few different

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,740
approaches there that we're interested

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:32,230
in Lincoln yeah yeah okay yeah we'd be

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:37,450
interested in that - yeah okay anything

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:42,280
else Cappy team has been working with

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:46,300
the CLI - yes 43 on exposing the v3

00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:49,110
commands and I am hoping that in the

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:53,020
next few weeks we'll be exposing the

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:59,110
hopefully exposing those kind of

00:19:53,020 --> 00:20:01,120
decomposed pushkin ends in the CFC my

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,030
help and just making that available for

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,940
their people to make use of our

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:09,280
expectation is to GA the eff related b3

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,430
endpoints hopefully in the next few

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,750
weeks and so then if you're using the

00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:22,770
latest releases you can start making

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:25,090
taking advantage of these primitives and

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,960
constructing me maybe more interesting

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:30,760
or administration's for your arab wishes

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,280
is there a decision on whether or not

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,950
there would be three prefix is gonna be

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,990
removed or means it cannot stay in terms

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,720
of the experience I believe there's

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:43,780
still some negotiation about how the how

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,200
the versioning will all work out I

00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:51,970
believe right now in the CLI which is

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,550
version 6.0 they will their plan is to

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:59,140
introduce all of these commands as v3 -

00:20:54,550 --> 00:21:00,179
look if you - push - but will that stay

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,999
or and

00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:06,539
stay in six start experimenting this is

00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:10,230
the current flow and there was

00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:13,740
discussion about when those be three

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:17,190
back to commands could become B default

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:22,950
push command and letting that required a

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:25,049
CLI in your version but I believe that

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:28,769
still under discussion not how to go

00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:31,889
about introducing them all right

00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:34,919
this is exciting stuff folks nobody is

00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:41,249
like cheering but no wait maybe cheering

00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:43,169
or so I want to be a spotlight caption I

00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:45,980
bought might really like cheering

00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:49,460
internally right like in square brackets

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:54,179
smiles on the inside

00:21:49,460 --> 00:22:00,659
excellent alright any questions for

00:21:54,179 --> 00:22:02,590
runtime or Yui or anybody else got area

00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:05,190
call so here

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,809
nope all right we're getting close to

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,360
passing you the mic

00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:13,779
David so let me give a quick update on

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:17,909
extensions so first thing is that as you

00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:25,059
know the pivotal team in London

00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:27,429
led by I guess I guess the the voice or

00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:29,799
the teams as well have pushed towards

00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:33,840
having this thing called BB yard

00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:37,059
it's called blush backup and restore and

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,669
we have a proposal out and the idea with

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:43,059
this is that you'll be able to use their

00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:45,580
tooling to backup and restore your

00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:49,029
entire pal foundry it's really really

00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:52,360
cool and interesting technology they've

00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:54,789
been trying to get this into the

00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,700
incubation for about a little bit more

00:22:54,789 --> 00:23:00,070
than a month and they are asking for the

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:04,320
final feedback right now you're the cool

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:06,999
thing is by the time this comes out and

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:11,200
and I guess is announced as an incubator

00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:13,570
the various parts of Condry are adopting

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:20,919
it so you'll be able to actually try so

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:23,409
this is beyond just a I guess a it's not

00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:26,950
just a stalk exactly it's not just a

00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:29,559
spec that's so I would highly recommend

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:33,009
everybody if you haven't taken a look at

00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:35,289
this to do take a look at it especially

00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:41,320
if you had your own backup and restore

00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:44,110
solution you know do that give Terez

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,090
who's leading the effort from the

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,970
pivotal London office some feedback

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:51,639
she's looking for it we have like a

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,490
deadline for feedback by the end of the

00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:56,649
day tomorrow I think maybe noon tomorrow

00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,269
I remember what it was but what we were

00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:00,820
looking for is feedback right we want to

00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:04,059
make sure that people get a chance to to

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,830
comment give their opinions because once

00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,659
it's once it goes through then it

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,379
becomes pretty much what we are thinking

00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:12,429
of moving forward with as a community

00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:15,700
obviously you could always add your own

00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:17,350
thing but the idea is to join voices

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,900
one way to back up and one way to

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,700
restore and perhaps you can add other

00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,820
things around it but that's gonna be to

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,530
call a backup and restore um so this is

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,380
Ruben here from far away now I had a

00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:32,160
question where can I leave the feedback

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:35,200
yes so ended up in the dock itself the

00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:38,910
Google Doc please make sure you you add

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,680
your comment you know gentle or violent

00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,930
you know feel free to add those because

00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,610
I know what Hermes is looking for

00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,620
feedback right so she's she's been

00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,600
actively trying to get feedback and

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,240
comment on them so if you put some

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,580
feedback she will try to answer so we

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,760
were running into a thing cart into a

00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,520
discussion with the credit team about

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,980
whether backup should be encrypted or

00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,580
not because currently when you do like a

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:09,970
backup of cred up the backup just as a

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:12,460
database backup which means that all the

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,920
keys in there are encrypted that means

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,620
to restore it you will need like the

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:21,490
original encryption key so that's like I

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:24,430
don't know that's I don't know if that's

00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:29,920
like if we should like have something

00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:33,370
around that about because you will now

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,580
be in the business of having to be able

00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:39,460
to know which key you used at the point

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,410
the backup was taken on you should

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,060
definitely ask her I think we there was

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,860
some discussion about whether or not it

00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,440
was encrypted and I think she she had

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,680
left it if I remember correctly from

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,780
version one I don't know if she's online

00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,790
but anyway definitely put it and let's

00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,640
let's let's restart that discussion

00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:59,080
again and since I mean she's former

00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,610
pivotal so I'm sure she can have some

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,610
discussion with the credits in as well

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,880
so thanks for that feedback yeah

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,700
definitely and everybody else I mean I

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,250
would I would say if you haven't taken a

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,740
look at the dark do that it's it's very

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,050
short it's maybe four pages long and

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,700
it's pretty straightforward so you take

00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:23,060
a look at it plus they have a they have

00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,040
the tool that you can try so if you make

00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,500
some comments there as then she can

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,350
definitely give you access to the tool

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,510
to try it also once that's released if

00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,120
anybody is using shield will be working

00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:37,960
on a plug-in to integrate with it

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,980
sweet Thank You Wayne so it's it's it is

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,260
possible to make it compatible with

00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,450
whatever you have but it's time for you

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:49,850
to get feedback if you want to make sure

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:51,650
that happens right so that's for bbr the

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,110
other thing is I've discussed this in

00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:58,850
the past but I'm really ready to show it

00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:01,790
soon is I created a github but to help

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:05,120
manage the whole process there is a new

00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:06,590
repo policy of extensions if you take a

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,760
look at it you're not gonna see the code

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:13,820
yet because I'm hiding it however

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:21,640
however it works you can see the results

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:23,660
of it works exactly it's Mechanical Turk

00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:28,610
no but if you're interested in

00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:31,700
participating join the PMC call on

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:34,250
Monday July 21st this is a tease right

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:37,400
because I will demo it there and then on

00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:40,460
August tap call I'll demo it as well and

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,890
it will make it available but the whole

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,350
point is that it's gonna make the

00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:49,850
process of managing CF extensions as

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:52,010
easy as just telling the github repo

00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,540
that is an extension that is an

00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,810
extension that's it that's all you need

00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:00,380
to do we'll just a get a CF extension

00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:02,630
and then within 24 hours it's gonna be

00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,020
updated with all the information that

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,620
you need

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:11,230
what visa you know the beginning of that

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:14,840
so that's coming we we are not doing

00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:16,390
bi-weekly calls on extensions mainly

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,710
because we don't have that

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:23,280
people but I anticipate more so right

00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:26,550
now it's only monthly if you're

00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,400
interested in having your own extensions

00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:31,840
join that call especially since it's

00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,460
gonna become easy for you to submit

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:40,690
proposals and participate so it's it's a

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,400
zoom call it's at 11:00 a.m. PDT so I

00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:45,730
know it's kind of terrible for some

00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:49,090
people in York but we could change it if

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,800
if needed so go to the slack CF

00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:55,000
extensions and put some comments there

00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:58,420
if if you wanna join in this time is bad

00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,780
for you it's literally the last Monday

00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:04,080
everyone

00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:07,460
yeah all right any questions for CF

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,460
extensions or runtime

00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:13,440
well okay so I guess we have one

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:21,310
presentation and it's gonna be David

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:25,060
savetti he's back to tell us about CF

00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:25,570
deployment I'm sure he has a lot to talk

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:30,520
about

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:31,660
so David take it you have pretty much as

00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,330
much time as you want

00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:38,830
since we don't have a second call a

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:40,420
second presentation okay

00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:45,280
well actually I don't you guys hear me

00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:46,660
okay yes I don't too much to talk about

00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,510
I just wanted to give a little update on

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,430
whatever I let see if form that let

00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,430
everyone know what we're actively

00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,960
working on and I really wanted to just

00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:59,440
give people a chance to ask questions

00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,300
about the doctor sent out a few weeks

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,020
ago regarding the deprecation of CF

00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:08,020
release and the schedule for that so I

00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:10,090
realize that as I sent out an email to

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,620
see if dev saying that this is the

00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,050
schedule one duplicate see after we saw

00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,880
me I realize that maybe not everybody

00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,890
follow see after that very closely so

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,620
case anyone missed that you know I

00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:23,980
wanted to get an update here so that

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,140
just you know deadlines all right yo got

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,910
a deadline there's a there's not an oh

00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,590
there was a deadline for giving feedback

00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,990
on the schedule which was passed for

00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,600
some weeks but I'm still you know eager

00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,740
to hear what people are thinking so let

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,090
me just go ahead and fill everyone in on

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:41,470
what's going on safe to point right now

00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,090
we're currently working on up ten

00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,610
measurements for the migration from

00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,830
sierra leads to CF deployment we want to

00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:51,430
make sure that when you do the migration

00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:52,840
you're not incurring we're not incurring

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,820
any downtime especially for your

00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:59,800
applications there might be some control

00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:01,420
in downtown but I would expect it to be

00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,890
pretty minimal as we're actually

00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,060
measuring that like we're building

00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,400
tooling to measure that right now so

00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,890
like every time we do a deploy we have a

00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,080
test that turns around and like watches

00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,870
the deployment and like hammers a map it

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,460
tries to push apps in the loop and a few

00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,910
other things fetching logs things like

00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:20,140
that we want to make sure that that apps

00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,280
are remaining available during the

00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,490
migration because it's a pretty

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,840
I have to change wrote ambient really

00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:30,670
have to change so we want to make sure

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:32,620
that people feel comfortable with the

00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:35,220
app instances that are running on the

00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,740
platforms that are being like migrated

00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,900
we have here are things that we might

00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:45,160
block GA on but I don't expect anyone to

00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,140
be too too too big or intense so I think

00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,850
there's gonna be some cleanup of ops

00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,180
files in the manifest

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,680
we might rejigger some of the defaults

00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,390
so we might say that for example

00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,300
Postgres is the default man apply

00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:01,290
default database and the manifest

00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:04,300
but the recommended like reduction

00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:06,370
database back in Cloud Foundry should be

00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,980
an H a database lights yet my super

00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:11,770
movies or third-party services that can

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:14,890
make you know a guarantee of some number

00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,210
of 9s that people like but you know out

00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:20,230
of the box you're gonna get the much

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:22,720
simpler Postgres this is it for for like

00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:25,330
dev and testing purposes the one of the

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,670
big thing that is in the way between us

00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:32,170
and GA is making validating deployment

00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:35,890
on AI as is besides GCP an AWS so we're

00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:39,040
working with sa p microsoft and vmware

00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:42,100
to validate it on vSphere OpenStack and

00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,960
either I did not map those correctly but

00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,110
hopefully it's obvious which companies

00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,460
are supporting which I as is and so

00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,630
we're gonna do some basic validations

00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,630
that you can propose you have to point

00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:53,890
that out to those infrastructures so

00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:58,300
there's a little bit of work for our

00:32:53,890 --> 00:33:00,880
team there so realistic me like like GA

00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,760
is still maybe I don't know three or

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,680
four weeks out so it's going to be a

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,860
little bit later than I specified in the

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,780
original email but I sort of expected

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,480
that I don't know that anyone's ever met

00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,370
the original deadline that they set for

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,060
themselves when it comes to something

00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:20,560
like this my my main problem would be

00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,810
email what I thought it was all too

00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:27,430
quick so I'm super glad that it's not

00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:28,660
definitely yeah and so like I said I did

00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,910
send out an email and for those of you

00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:34,820
who missed it the basic the basic

00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:37,190
outline of the doc was that

00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,469
once the GAF deployment once the upon

00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,419
that goes version 1.0 we want to give

00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:42,739
we're plan to support both so you have

00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,349
deployment and CFO released for about

00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:46,699
two months and the idea is that for

00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:50,629
those two months we would continue to

00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:52,159
cut releases of CF release and ANSI have

00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:56,749
to plan that like that would give like a

00:33:52,159 --> 00:34:01,249
nice window other like versions that CF

00:33:56,749 --> 00:34:02,749
release like like what services versions

00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:04,969
of CF release that can be successfully

00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:07,359
upgraded to versions of CF deployment so

00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:11,269
there should be like a nice body of

00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:12,710
transitional environments that can add

00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:14,029
ability matrix that people can leverage

00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:18,440
when they want to transition their

00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:24,649
environments let's see what else that's

00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:27,259
few notes here that's pretty much it

00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:28,429
after about so the doc says two months

00:34:27,259 --> 00:34:31,490
after two months we're going to stop

00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:32,809
kind of new CF releases and not really

00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:36,139
be supporting that but doesn't mean that

00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:38,349
you you know you have to migrate within

00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:40,039
those two months it just means that

00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:42,559
we're not going to be cutting new

00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:45,679
versions of CF release and so people

00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,909
will need to at some point they'll run

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,960
out of versions of C if released and

00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:49,159
they'll have to upgrade to see if

00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,250
deployment they want to get the new bit

00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,349
I went out there looking for feedback

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,669
but no one actually gave me any feedback

00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:57,410
throughout the timeline the only

00:34:55,669 --> 00:35:00,230
feedback I got was about aya support

00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:02,690
which was a very reasonable question and

00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,700
Mike we're trying to address it now if

00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,920
you guys do have feedback about the

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,410
timeline please reach out to me or you

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,880
know go ahead and ask questions here we

00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,009
think two months is a decent amount of

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,720
time

00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:16,009
we've gotten a little bit I think Jules

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,359
is not the first person to say that that

00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:19,579
seems a little bit short but no one's

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:25,099
actively come out and said we need X

00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:26,299
amount of time so yeah so we're like I

00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:27,500
said we're looking for feedback on that

00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:30,230
schedule but it seems like a reasonable

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,160
place to start and you might potentially

00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:38,029
open it up especially if you find that

00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:39,410
the initial the initial team's doing my

00:35:38,029 --> 00:35:40,880
creations to see if deployment are

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:43,789
having a hard time you might say okay

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,109
this is and we're doing it in CI right

00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:47,720
now so we don't think there's too much

00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:49,280
of a problem but you know we

00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,020
it's replicating everyone's production

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,190
environment so it's very possible that

00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,150
people are going to give us a big data

00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,650
as they try to start the transition so

00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:59,630
we're aware of that can you talk about

00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,940
your tools I know you have some tooling

00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,270
that you created yeah there's a there's

00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,800
a repo policy of deployment transition

00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:10,960
right now it just got a few basic things

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:14,000
in it it has a script that extracts

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,369
graduals from from a set of manifests

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,700
and spits them out into a flower store

00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:22,250
so like CF deployment likes to manage

00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,250
it's all of its credentials using the -

00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:27,320
- of our store flag and the new boss CLI

00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:29,180
which has a nice like transparent

00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,780
integration with credible if you want to

00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:34,460
move over to that and that's actually

00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,900
the long term goal like we don't expect

00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,609
the virus story to be a workflow that we

00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,040
suggest for very long

00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:41,480
as soon as as soon as we get big

00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,680
credible ingratiating like we're in and

00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,619
sort of tell everybody to start doing

00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,570
that but this is or the interim solution

00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:51,020
so the manifest doesn't have to hold all

00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:53,480
of the credentials itself old manifests

00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,099
to hold all the credentials so like if

00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,960
you use the manifest generation

00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:58,880
description CF release your produce

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,290
manifest has a bunch of TLS turns and

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,210
passwords secret keys and we have a tool

00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,070
that like reads your manifest and pulls

00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:09,230
out all those parentals and formats it

00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:10,849
into a bar spoon so that you don't have

00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,599
to do all that manual work yourself

00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:16,339
they're also called ops files for

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,890
limiting the scope of the transition so

00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:21,730
let me give a quick example of that see

00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,730
if deployment deploys

00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:26,150
oh I'm not I don't have like a demo or a

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,940
presentation or anything like that

00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:30,710
I mean I could I get a you can just

00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,440
throw it right ambi yeah sure why not

00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:43,880
let's see I want me to open it up don't

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:49,150
play I share screen I love that it's at

00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,150
the bottom of that something yep this

00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,790
yeah we can

00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:59,740
okay yes they feel what's up I'm doing

00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:03,010
here okay cool

00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:06,430
so this is this is similar transition

00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:08,800
there's this extract of our store from

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:10,000
manifest script this is what I was

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,750
talking about his father building a

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,810
forest or from the manifest there are

00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:18,040
some ops files here as well for limited

00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,500
like I said limiting the scope of the

00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,790
transition so for example this one here

00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,890
is called remove routing API for

00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,490
transition so a little context around

00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,680
this thing

00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:30,430
see if deployment deploys the routing

00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:32,560
API by default whereas in CF release

00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:34,030
world you actually have to deploy a

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,590
whole separate deployment of the route

00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:39,940
and release in order to get the routing

00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:41,950
API functionality we it actually is

00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,480
possible as part of the transition to

00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,960
just say all right great we're going

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:50,170
we're getting the routing API that too

00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,900
but that's like not necessarily a

00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,700
trivial migration we do for example you

00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,250
need to have a backing database for the

00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,270
writing API and so if you don't already

00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,680
have that set up

00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,850
you might want a way to say well let me

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,760
transition this you have to form it

00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,230
first and then in a separate deploy I

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,860
will set up the database that I need for

00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:11,290
adding API and enable it and so that's

00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,210
why like this exists so I allow you to

00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,620
opt out of taking on some of the new

00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,570
features and see if deployment as part

00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:19,480
of the transition so that you can like

00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:20,860
opt into that incrementally it's like

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,070
that's been one of the things we trying

00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,680
to work towards is like instead of one

00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:29,710
enormous migration deploy allowing

00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,990
deployers to do a series of smaller to

00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:36,700
post each of which contains you know

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:38,590
less risk so so that's one of our one of

00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:42,790
my running goals with the deployment or

00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:47,680
the transition trolls and then lastly

00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:51,670
there is this CFR to CFG ml which really

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,900
just adds the boss migrated from so if

00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,960
you're not not from that with the

00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:59,110
migrated from field in the manifest

00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,420
essentially what it sells Bosch's I'm

00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,310
renaming an instance group from one

00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,300
deployment to another so you don't have

00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,800
to roll the PM's

00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,140
we don't have to change the IP addresses

00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:11,720
by people who reuse this virtual machine

00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:16,510
and just rename the job of the instance

00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,510
group so that's much of what's in here

00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:24,560
yeah that's about it so we're planning

00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:26,900
to add a few more tools in here you know

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,160
if people come out and ask for specific

00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,530
tools this is likely where they would

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,360
live so like one thing that someone

00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,490
recently proposed is like hey I don't

00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:38,510
know how to build a cloud config for my

00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:40,190
posh boss my boss director like maybe

00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,440
you can help build a tool that helps us

00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:45,350
with that like that's one thing we're

00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,790
considering as we were looking at

00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,440
designs floor they realize like it's

00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:51,350
actually not a very easy problems and

00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,730
you're like it's very easy for it it's

00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,170
easy for humans to do but actually quite

00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,880
hard for other sheets to do

00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,410
there's like a lot of subjective stuff

00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,880
going on in there

00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:02,770
but when you know that that might be

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:07,670
something we try to tackle for for those

00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:09,560
operators who've never used it so yeah

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,990
overall we're I'm just trying to be as

00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,030
open as possible and like get feedback

00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:16,430
from people who are trying this out so

00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:19,280
my big request from everybody on the

00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,020
call as if you guys could if you haven't

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,790
taken a look at CF deployment just get

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:28,490
your hands on it and try to plug it to a

00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:30,170
test environment but let me know well

00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:32,240
you know you think about it and if you

00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,730
can like learn a few to are gearing up

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,310
to try a migration on a staging

00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,660
environment if you have that kind of

00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:41,900
bandwidth that would be incredible

00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:43,430
feedback for the transition tooling so

00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,740
that way you know when you do it you

00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,390
know line with production you know don't

00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,750
feel so scared by you thought that once

00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:52,610
before it know what the tooling is like

00:41:49,750 --> 00:42:01,250
so high on a question or suggestion for

00:41:52,610 --> 00:42:06,290
tools though the credit feel like they

00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:08,960
are working on yeah

00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,940
is that something you would like support

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,140
and so instead of extracting to a forest

00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:19,760
or a file extracting to an important

00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:21,960
file for credit that's a good point that

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,810
seems pretty reasonable I

00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:28,410
I wonder if you know what the format for

00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:30,990
the like bulk import would be for credit

00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:37,380
I like kind of surprises if it's not a

00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:39,300
large door David David I was gonna say I

00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,839
did something similar for one of our

00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,760
production environments just a little

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,650
quick script that just keeps on callin

00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,599
credibly CLI so we can shout more if you

00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:53,160
wanna explore that type of tool as well

00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:55,109
okay but ultimately Dave I don't think

00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,880
they have a book which which makes sense

00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:59,369
kind of since you just keep on calling

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,470
the individual commands they just

00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:03,060
automate that oh I see

00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:05,400
it was Reuben who asked the initial

00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,619
questions right yeah I did okay so

00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,520
Rueben dude it wasn't like a balk in

00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:13,470
court as like a script that like reads

00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,089
like a master in the credits Eli they

00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:19,619
have a story they are currently working

00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:20,190
on importing credentials from a file so

00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:23,460
they are

00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:25,230
I think it's cred up import or something

00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,089
it's not yet released but they are

00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:29,849
working on it

00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:32,490
so I created a Bush release to seed

00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:37,200
credentials to cred up and then I found

00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:38,520
this feature so I thought no that's it

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,280
that's a really good question this is a

00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:44,490
good action for me to follow up with the

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,280
grinder I can go to that arena for

00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:55,530
production rights to actually migrate to

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:58,380
write up or me okay I know definitely

00:43:55,530 --> 00:44:01,950
not thanks for this can you scroll down

00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:05,460
a bit - yeah India is it ready to use

00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:08,550
section in NCI frequency of deployment

00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,530
itself oh I'm sorry yes yeah I can do

00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,280
that let's see another one looking at

00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,900
the new window

00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,710
yeah so either that needs to be updated

00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:22,619
to where you're at or well what we're

00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:24,270
almost there so I don't I've been for I

00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,160
think at least two months now running a

00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:30,060
one of the UCF deployments in production

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:32,130
successfully so pretty sweet okay Oh

00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,630
though I kind of disagree with that

00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,010
second line but that's me so with the

00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,630
downtime testing so that

00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,150
working on right now that's literally

00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:41,820
the stories we have in flight what are

00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,590
they what does that include so it's

00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,410
mostly just building tooling for

00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:49,110
asserting uptime over the course of the

00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:50,700
deploy ok it's like we're actually doing

00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:54,510
that in the concourse job as part of our

00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:56,510
box deploy like there's the tool we're

00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:59,520
solely like the current of the current

00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:01,440
incarnation of this tool actually wraps

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,180
the Bosch deployed command so like it

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,580
does a series of setup things

00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,990
runs box deploy and then immediately

00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,210
turns like wall the box displays

00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:11,220
activate and separate their routines we

00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,320
like performs different tests against

00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,170
the platform to like curl an app like

00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,820
like push an app like once a minute try

00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:23,250
to fix logs every five seconds kind of

00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:26,100
stuff so so we actually haven't gotten

00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:28,320
it completely green build of that yet

00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:31,530
it's sort of like we're gonna prove

00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:34,200
ability of the yeah we'd like to make a

00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:37,110
lot of assertions about about like

00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,060
platform of time or like like happens in

00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,890
some plan as part of the plug as a

00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,270
platform feature but it's actually the

00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:44,340
thing we don't test very often it's a

00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,980
good thing we can cure eclis validate

00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,120
once every like two years so we just

00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,110
thought like maybe we should just build

00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,900
let's go and actually do this in the

00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,280
pipeline like we do with everything else

00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,650
so that's what we're we're building that

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,660
tooling right now okay but how does that

00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:59,250
blocking like recommending this for

00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:02,370
production you put because I mean like

00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,450
if CF deployment better or I mean

00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:05,790
knowing they'll see if people want but I

00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:08,610
mean CF receive release any better yeah

00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:10,980
your question is like if if this is as

00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:13,710
good or better than the CF releases

00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,970
backs or guarantees shouldn't we just go

00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:19,200
ahead and cream like this part of it

00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:22,200
yeah I mean like if there's nothing else

00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:26,340
in CF release that guarantees this this

00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,290
part right CF deployment actually

00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:31,290
generating a tool to do it but we we

00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:34,620
don't have the proof yet but at least at

00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:39,510
this point it should be as good as CF t

00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:43,800
blow okay yeah that's why we're hoping

00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:45,480
to deprecate one very quickly I think

00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,230
David the point here is also the fact

00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,760
that

00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:49,140
you and I don't know if you have a

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,560
document for this but there needs to be

00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:55,109
some kind of a case made for people

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,970
moving to this right so there's there's

00:46:55,109 --> 00:47:00,180
a lot of value in this maybe you can

00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:02,220
outline what what do I gain by moving to

00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:07,050
CFC forever all right entering that

00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:08,940
question I think it's a little bit

00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:09,990
different than what what they're talk

00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,240
about like it sounds like what other

00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,130
people are asking for is like if this is

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,170
already at least as good as see if

00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:17,760
release like can't with green line it

00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,040
for production environments for new

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,630
production environments and say that

00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,030
like it's not blocked on down time

00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,350
testing that right

00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,570
Varian enough no no I understand that

00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:30,810
but but I'm just saying that why would I

00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:32,400
move to CF deployment sure you know like

00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:35,250
what's the what's the what's a message

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,020
there right thank you it could be ready

00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,940
but like if the other one is just as

00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,760
good like what what's my motivation for

00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:43,470
move yeah sure do I'm gonna talk about

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,500
that now or is that like a doctor you

00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:48,540
like you want somewhere creation story

00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,090
right this is we are now talking about

00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:53,850
like new deployments and where it's

00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:56,100
obvious because you want to use CF

00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:59,280
deployment because that's the future you

00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:01,080
know that will be the next thing right

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,350
so otherwise you will have to migrate

00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:07,440
for fairly soon right if you start new

00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:08,820
now with CF release you know that like

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:14,010
in the coming months you have to do a

00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:16,609
migration actually answers in part dr.

00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:19,830
max your question because essentially

00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:22,140
there is a within a couple month

00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:24,480
timeline whereby CF release will no

00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:28,290
longer be releasing new versions and all

00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:31,050
new bits are released via CF deployment

00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:33,119
therefore if they don't upgrade and in

00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,680
the next couple months or have a plan

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,420
for doing that then they're going to be

00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,060
left behind so if they need some

00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:41,010
critical updates whatever they need to

00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:43,530
migrate in keep the updates there's not

00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,760
a problem yeah yeah and I think I mean

00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,170
dr. Mike Stephen correct me if I'm wrong

00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,640
but I think that part of the question

00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:50,550
was like why do we even have CF

00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,380
deployment is that right I actually am

00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:53,609
all for it I'm just saying yeah but

00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,290
you're like you want you want someone to

00:48:53,609 --> 00:48:58,809
like actually make the case like why do

00:48:55,290 --> 00:49:01,279
why do we bother to build a new process

00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:03,170
maybe yeah maybe maybe it's at the

00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:05,359
beginning of your of your read me here

00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:07,309
maybe I there are some stuff there are

00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,559
some stuff in here there's like a

00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:10,940
purpose document or like a section

00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:12,200
called purpose here that sort of

00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,730
explains like what some of the big

00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,489
difficulties with CF released used to be

00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:20,769
or how are currently and how Steve

00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:23,150
deployment tries to prioritize certain

00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:25,940
like certain characteristics of all you

00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:29,359
really want deployments will look like

00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:32,660
the Cloud Foundry alright this one for

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:34,279
the chat like what Joe is asking over

00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,349
that yeah is there positive reason to go

00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:37,279
along with the negative reason that

00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,900
you'll be left behind

00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,519
yes so I think I think the positive

00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,279
reason I think that's exactly the right

00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:46,609
way to frame it the positive reason is

00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:48,079
that like it simplifies all of these all

00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,430
of the deployment workflows that like

00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,279
all the parts of deployment that used to

00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:54,710
be tricky so manifest generation becomes

00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:57,289
considerably simpler simpler if you

00:49:54,710 --> 00:50:00,170
don't manage this v template to me the

00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:02,630
big like like vision that I have for CF

00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,309
deployment is that when you couple over

00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:07,849
like ease of deployment with the

00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:09,980
versioning scheme you plan to use ICC of

00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:12,019
deployment as the opportunity to really

00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:14,119
move towards continuous deployment like

00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:16,579
we want to tell for example at pivotal

00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:19,430
like we want to tell our little web

00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:21,380
services team to actually not even look

00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:23,749
at their deployment like just have a

00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:26,029
cock-horse job that pulls the latest

00:50:23,749 --> 00:50:27,589
version of CF deployment up to a major

00:50:26,029 --> 00:50:29,630
version so and we want to use major

00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:31,880
version bumps as a signal that says hey

00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:35,569
this is a big change or this is a change

00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:37,910
it requires manual intervention but like

00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:39,259
if it's not a major version bump you

00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:41,029
should actually be able to just have a

00:50:39,259 --> 00:50:42,920
concur stop that automatically deploys

00:50:41,029 --> 00:50:44,239
the latest CF deployment and like you

00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,130
can do it in the middle of the night and

00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:48,559
you won't like that's kind of at the

00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,819
tree and so I think a lot of the

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,259
features of C a deployment is like

00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:54,470
getting us closer to that where

00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:56,450
deployment is just like a non-issue and

00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:58,220
so to me that's to me that's like the

00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,869
positive reason for CF deployment is

00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:03,739
that it enables it really tries to

00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:07,789
enable continuous deployment as like at

00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:08,869
its core so and that's the thing that I

00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:12,079
like a lot of teams aren't going to be

00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:13,519
safe like even the pivotal like the

00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,259
the Web Services team is not used to

00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:16,759
that you know and so like I imagine that

00:51:15,259 --> 00:51:18,589
lots of teams will it'll take a while

00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:21,229
for them they get used to that mentality

00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:22,969
but like that sort of debris and this is

00:51:21,229 --> 00:51:26,200
part of the reason why I was asking this

00:51:22,969 --> 00:51:30,200
and also you and I chatted before about

00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:33,170
some concern about the two months sort

00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:36,140
of migration because I think some people

00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:38,059
I guess even in my case I'm trying to

00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,640
motivate them to use it in the

00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:43,999
motivation at least so far as and I have

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,369
not been doing a good job but that's

00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:49,400
important because a lot of big companies

00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:51,049
like us we have runbook automation where

00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,569
we have tons of people following those

00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:55,910
run books and even if this is better

00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:58,549
what we have to do is also change those

00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:00,680
run books and then we train people so

00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:01,609
there's a bunch of consequences too even

00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,009
something that's better

00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:06,940
right so motivating it is important

00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:06,940
totally yeah

00:52:07,489 --> 00:52:13,549
Punch Time what my main question is when

00:52:11,299 --> 00:52:15,650
in how are you gonna be doing versioning

00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:17,089
because right now I'm riding the master

00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:19,219
train which has been great and it's

00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:22,819
we're working but you know let's see if

00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:25,309
deployment yes we already worked where

00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:27,049
we're currently releasing minor bump

00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:29,719
like minor versions every time I cut

00:52:27,049 --> 00:52:31,729
master so if you like if you pull tags

00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:35,140
on CF deployment you should sleep I

00:52:31,729 --> 00:52:37,339
think the live version 0.13 this week ok

00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,539
you actually are doing that now I must

00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:39,949
have missed that that's ok

00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:43,549
yeah like it's we haven't been like

00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:44,900
advertising it broadly but you know like

00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:48,349
we actually intend to do real stumper

00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:50,509
with it we're a major version bumps mean

00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:54,529
that like sort of in the same way when a

00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:57,589
major version buff for an API or a like

00:52:54,529 --> 00:52:59,029
a library mean that you have to like act

00:52:57,589 --> 00:53:01,249
like there's a backwards and compatible

00:52:59,029 --> 00:53:03,589
change and as a user you have to go in

00:53:01,249 --> 00:53:06,799
and like update your code or you know to

00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:08,150
use the new API in the same way when

00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:09,979
it's a major version bump as the

00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:12,289
operator you might have to change your

00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:15,589
deployment or some process of you deploy

00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:20,449
process I I'd like to say something

00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:22,849
about why me great to migrate to safe

00:53:20,449 --> 00:53:25,770
deployments because here in France I

00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:30,480
just run the very first bush trainings

00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:34,740
in history anyway these were 12 people

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:37,410
and the very first one in French and I

00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:39,510
had prepared something did the story the

00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:42,060
small story I'd like to tell you is that

00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:46,560
I had prepared some slides about space

00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:50,310
and as first and it's a trial things and

00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:52,830
when when I was there as is the guys

00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:56,580
well do you want to dig into that and

00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:59,880
they told me no no you just extol the

00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:02,070
interest but two things to weigh it just

00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,040
makes sense we don't want to know the

00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:07,890
bad about Bosch one yeah and that's what

00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:13,260
I would say the the point is those two

00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:18,060
makes much more sense but patching theis

00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:20,040
with the new patch team compared to two

00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:23,550
sleeve with the merge and the layers

00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:26,550
which which is which are quite poorly

00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:31,140
documented really layers that you do

00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:33,500
that's you you merge them and for me

00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:38,250
that would be the very first point

00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:40,080
operators I mean yeah as i said i was

00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:42,090
playing devil's advocate i know it is

00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,950
better but i have to somehow motivate

00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:46,020
people and i imagine there are other

00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:48,060
people with the same problem which is

00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:50,160
how do you tell people they're doing

00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,720
something wrong there is a better way

00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,240
and it just kind of take you a little

00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:57,270
bit of effort to go to that better way

00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:00,000
and the other point is that since the

00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:02,670
commanding implement best practices and

00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,680
we were looking for for those best

00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:07,770
practices in the sift release for for a

00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:10,410
long long time and we're wondering what

00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:14,250
way isn't it there those best practices

00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:17,550
that we understand they do we should do

00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:21,150
and they are not in what we are proposed

00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:24,930
to deploy so it's finally implements

00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:27,270
this procedures i the two major content

00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:29,700
would mentioned that why going to safety

00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:31,020
pounds yeah absolutely

00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,070
yeah i think that's a really good point

00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,780
and that's like that was actually the

00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:36,270
initial motivation i think behind so you

00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:38,430
have to point it was that to leverage

00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,330
all the boss to features that people

00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,370
have been talked

00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:43,080
for quite a while I mean like things

00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:44,610
like links and cloud could think it's

00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,510
been around for quite like quite some

00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,670
time

00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:52,110
and that was that the original

00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:54,180
motivation was to use those things but

00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:55,590
it was it's hard to introduce those into

00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,630
CR police because the F release doesn't

00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,980
have a real versioning scheme like it

00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:02,370
has a fake versioning scheme or every

00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:04,770
single thing as a major version book and

00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:06,420
so so we wanted to maintain the

00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:08,460
backwards compatibility of the manifest

00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,810
generation and so yeah at least but by

00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,820
breaking away to see if deployment we

00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:14,280
could just sort of say no like time them

00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:15,540
for everyone to move to the future so I

00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,910
think that's a great point like it's

00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:20,220
probably one of the big selling points

00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:24,980
then just get to use the those new box

00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:27,360
features out of the box cool cool

00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,010
excellent all right let's see if there

00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:32,850
are any final questions because we're at

00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:37,410
the top of the hour know what is I think

00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:38,970
you help sorry oh good no nothing I'm

00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:40,200
actually asking the part of the reason

00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:42,540
I'm asking those questions because I'm

00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,300
asking people to to watch the video of

00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,910
this and those are some questions that I

00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:50,400
know people would have so if you are

00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:52,830
watching this and you haven't tried have

00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,620
not tried CFD comment you should do that

00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:57,060
I know David even suggested that he's I

00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,010
mean they have a slack channel right

00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:00,480
David yeah the receive deployments

00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:03,060
watching all the people who come and ask

00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,650
questions at any time exactly so if

00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:07,260
you're trying this and you have some

00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:10,170
questions David is here and his team to

00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:13,080
answer it is better it is the way to go

00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:15,380
it's more secure it uses watch - there's

00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:18,540
nothing else to add right so then

00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:23,010
alright you're not watching this you

00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:25,560
should be alright thank you everybody

00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:30,950
we'll talk in August I'll be presenting

00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:30,950
so come thanks everyone Thanks
