little background noise from something

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:25,410
nobody actually yeah nice people you

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:27,750

arm ready and it's 8:02

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,290
so I think we're already starting to

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,969
record so we'll go ahead and start as

00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:42,930
you can see we have kind of a full

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,100
agenda today so let's just get straight

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,399
into it

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,379
is there anybody from the foundation

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,300
that can give update on the summit

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,160
that's upcoming in New York become it

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,270

hey done all right hey man how's

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,580
everybody all right so European summits

coming up don't forget to register if

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,930
you're a contributor you should have

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,900
seen the code on the dev list already

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,210
feel free to register we have pretty

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,180
awesome agenda if you haven't checked it

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:22,020
out take a look all kinds of really fun

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,869
talks about existing projects some of

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,009
the direction of the project as always I

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,780
expected to be great

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,509
register registration numbers look

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,670
pretty good so you know it will it will

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,329
cap that at some point make sure to get

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,070
registered if you have it let's see so

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,240
there's a there's a member survey that

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,060
was filled it looks like some of these

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,619
notes in here from from the past that's

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,890
already done as cons over we did sign up

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,990
with the call for code program that

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,399
IBM's running we're still working out

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,000
some logistics about how we're going to

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,439
support that may be a virtual hackathon

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,939
if you haven't looked at the call for

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,880
code I think it's a really amazing

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,250
initiative thanks to the folks from IBM

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,369
that are on for their company screw

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,450
having that I think it's really neat

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:13,950
let's see and I think those are those

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:16,100
are probably the major major updates

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,600
yeah as always you can find us on slash

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,209
so I won't take up too much time because

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,260
you know there are demos to get to you

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,260
any questions

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,120
okay I don't hear any questions Thank

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,510
You chip I'll second that call for code

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,840
I had added that on the agenda check it

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,780
out

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,409
I mean it's it's you know like as a

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,650
person that lived through a pretty bad

00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:46,739
disaster and 2010 in my home country of

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,200
Haiti I had done something like this

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:55,010
where I you know try to build apps to

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:58,620
help people and I had a recent sort of

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,329
discussion about this in you know if we

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,400
had the stuff that we have for call for

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:06,540
coup then obviously things that happen

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,370
in and put her equal last year you know

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,579
we see different parts of the world in

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,480
Japan other places help so if you want

00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:17,639
to put your coding skills to something

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,919
that is bigger than yourself and bigger

00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,500
than your organization that's an

00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,079
opportunity so check it out okay so

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,939
that's all I have to say I think chip

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,510
what about the member survey I think

00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:33,239
Shana had mentioned it a few times is it

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,019
still a void or are we done with this

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,849
I'm sorry we're done yeah no problem I

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,379
hit that really fast because the yeah

00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,449
the survey closed out we got good

00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,430
responses it was sent specifically to

00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:46,560
what are called the the primary contacts

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,989
for each one of the member companies the

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,519
foundation found exported maybe

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,530
mentioned it but it's it's the way that

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,379
we look at how we're supporting all of

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,530
you the community the marketing needs of

00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,909
the organizations involved the you know

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,079
various technical groups so it does a

00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:06,900
good good gauge on how we should adjust

00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:09,389
just like many of you in your project

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,609
teams and you know within your company

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,870
as you do a lot of iteration we try to

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,030
do the same thing with the way that we

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,090
support you so that's part of our

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,320
feedback loop that we get sweet all

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:25,800
right thank you very much okay so as you

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,060
heard think with chip billion and the

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,729
foundation care other questions

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,229
all right so we'll get to the two I

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,870
guess the other part of the program

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,669
which is sort of overview of the

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,529
different PMC so kind of highlights

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,270
anything important obviously if there's

00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,600
our talk related to it and there's a

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,280
need

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,960
if you want to mention something else

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:50,400
and you we actually move to become the

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,100
sort of PMC lead for the entire PMC's so

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,080
I guess she gets off this mess yeah and

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,160
then you get out of it or is it not yeah

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,350
anyways okay well but Eric is here and

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,690
every usually gives you a bit for Yui so

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,640
I guess everyone you can tell us in the

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,090
eye right yeah sure so a few highlights

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,970
from the the runtime PMC I can't be is

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,160
continuing to make progress on going

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,190
athletes or we're native to your

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,830
downtime Apple so I think they're

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,530
they're close to the point where they're

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,030
ready for more public data on that

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,290
they're working with CLI team about what

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,150
that's going to look like in terms of

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,500
integration there I think even though

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,790
the API endpoints might be there at this

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,280
point so if you enable their new

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,870
component that does that and start

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,780
moving drop ups around then you can

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:41,960
start playing around with them gardens

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:44,760
also started work on their efforts to

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,210
improve some of the CPU controls inside

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,120
of CF so we're on the Diego team working

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,590
with them to start integrating that I

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,320
know the container networking team is

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:58,080
also making progress on their track work

00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,970
around dynamic egress rules so making

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,420
those applications security groups more

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:07,760
dynamic both in terms of updating them

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:10,260
on running instances and tying them to

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,200
DNS names instead of just raw IP

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,140
addresses and then there's a bunch of

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,730
integration work that's been going on

00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:22,910
the build max team is working on getting

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:25,950
the been to Bionic based CF Linux FS 3

00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:29,580
out and getting the build max compatible

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:31,680
with that and then working with roly's

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,200
integration and other teams like happy

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,660
in Diego to get that integrated into CF

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,430
2.0 so that's all ready to go and we're

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,850
giving people enough lead time before

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:44,490
Trustee comes out of support in April of

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,020
next year and similarly we're

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,310
integrating its the Zinio stem cells

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,310
that the Vash game has been producing

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:55,289
then also we're increasingly

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:58,499
integrating the DTM project across all

00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:01,080
of the runtime bas releases so in long

00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:03,120
term that'll will give better isolation

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,310
between jobs somewhat simpler operator

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,409
experience support release author

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,050
experience in terms of having less

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,870
complexity bastards so with some

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,260
security benefits there from

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,290
simplifications and oscillation

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:22,100
sweet thank you Eric

00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:24,770
if you have a question it's the time now

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,970
okay I'll add something though just

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,220
because you mentioned buildpack Derek

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,620
the for those of you that have been

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:35,990
paying attention to stuff going on in CN

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:39,920
CF you'll note that the effort to kind

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:42,710
of unfort the karoku and Cloud Foundry

00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,860
buildpack approach is going to be

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:49,790
presented to the CNCs talk as a way to

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,800
try to move that unfortunates forward

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:54,310
that's going to happen I think next

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,350
Wednesday or no I'm sorry Tuesday

00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,770
morning us time so that's kind of cool

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,720
so if you're paying attention to CNCs

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,580
you'll start seeing that show up and

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,860
you'll see the debate start to occur so

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:11,930
whether or not it makes sense to house

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:14,530
that there is a common home cool we got

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:19,940
Stephen of iron on it I'm waiting for

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:22,850
this guy all right so we move on to now

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:26,750
Bosh and it's my distinct pleasure to

00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:29,210
introduce Fred who is I guess new p.m.

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,550
over boss or one of the PM's oh yeah

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,070
exactly so nice to meet you all so

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,400
essentially we've had that p.m.

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:39,260
transition at people talk for for Bosch

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,270
and since Dimitri is on the call I would

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,160
like to thank him for all these

00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,070
contributions over the year it's done a

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,960
great job and we try to to do as well

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,550
you're trying to get over there I try it

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,380
every day

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,460
that's why we've got to PM's for brush

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:57,290
now I mean nobody can keeps up with him

00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,530
so essentially I'm the Bosch p.m.

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,840
Toronto the Toronto part of the team and

00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:06,440
we've got Morgan fine not sure if is on

00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:10,310
the call who is on new San Francisco

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,430
p.m. and we've got a new PMC lead as

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,520
well Marco from ACP so mark are you

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,520
there

00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,360
might be late for him yeah yeah so I

00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,610
wasn't sure we didn't coordinate in

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,760
advance in any case so Marco has

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:29,190
accepted to take on the role and sent

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,380
out an email recently highlighting some

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,370
changes that we want we want to make to

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:38,130
our PMC so essentially adding separate

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:42,000
projects with separate keys and thrown

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:45,990
poutines it and we'll try to rejig all

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,420
our projects for around CPI as well

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,400
because we have some of them incubating

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,170
some of them officials so we need to

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,450
make things clearer to reflect the fact

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,710
that we've got well some of them are

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:00,450
quite stable now so we'll probably them

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:05,220
upgraded to full-blown projects at at

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:08,520
some point in the future as far as

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,880
product direction go we are still trying

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,870
to solidify our three-month six-month

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,910
nine-month map and we'll communicate

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,770
some point to make it clear you

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,460
shouldn't expect too many too many big

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:25,470
big changes I mean obviously we won't we

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,530
won't set the world on fire at least

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,870
initially with whatever bright ideas we

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,470
have yes so continuity is a key

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:38,310
obviously for us and transparency

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:41,250
under-21 also we've got some amount of

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:45,360
debt as far as github and PRS are

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,940
concerned and Morgan and I are keen on

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,110
you know paying off that debt and be

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,550
more not reactive because that's what

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,740
we've been doing but proactive in

00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,620
addressing them in the future

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,900
so look forward to maybe communications

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,390
from us if you submitted issues and PRS

00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,100
and you know from us or one member of

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,130
the team because we want to dedicate

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:13,200
some engineering time to that

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:16,290
and apart from that obviously we've had

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,650
quite a few releases in the last few

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,070
weeks

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:23,160
mostly addressing some issues around

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:26,610
links and variables stuff like that but

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:29,830
also new features got in like VM

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:34,300
hot-swap that will enable you

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:36,490
essentially to you know create a new VM

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,100
and and then delete the old one instead

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,750
of you know delete and then wait for the

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,810
new want to be there so this should help

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,090
with upgrades and scenarios like that

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,040
and many other things what I mean that's

00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:51,190
all in the more detailed release notes

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,870
that we are putting up now so if you

00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:57,250
have a look for example at the release

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:59,260
notes for 260 7.2 and up you will see

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,320
that we put much more detail into what

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,960
got in for fixes improvements and stuff

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,620
like that so obviously looking forward

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:11,080
for our feedback from everybody in the

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:16,480
community about how we are doing up to

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,520
now and I would be in add some in so if

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,650
you have any bug concerns obviously I

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,100
would be more than happy and Morgan will

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,750
be there too and if you travel to spring

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,520
one as well I will be there in

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,630
Washington so looking forward to meet

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,700
with people from the community at around

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:36,730
Thank You Fred all right

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:39,340
also also I'm just gonna keep

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:42,400
interjecting additional thing so the the

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:45,100
project that was proposed by Sousa which

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,930
I think the the proposal document talks

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,690
about containerize NCS but it's the

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,750
fizzle codebase that takes a Bosch

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:55,450
release manifest and turns it into a an

00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:58,270
image has been accepted to incubate as

00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:02,200
of I think leaders yesterday I believe

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:03,700
or early this morning excellent thank

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,270
you Jeff

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,070
any quick questions for Fred or you know

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,230
I guess additional things related to

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,360
Bush that basically means that the

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:16,870
fissile will be officially supported ish

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,380
right it means that it's an incubating

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:23,170
project right I'm so it becomes a

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,820
clatter Foundation project and then I

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,470
think the work of that team is to figure

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,910
out how it integrates with the rest of

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:35,130
the debauchee efforts and so think of it

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,339
as a start to that process Thanks

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,939
all right

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:42,550
a huge chip let's move on to open

00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:45,399
serviceworker API I think I saw a dog

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,889
there don't you want to mention any

00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:52,209
updates actually we have nothing new to

00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:54,639
present I say I think we did do a

00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:57,959
release further recently at 2.14 I

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,860
believe ok this is out there

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,259
John us the camera with the biggest

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,120
feature was it's been awhile since we

00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,529
talked about it all right I don't use

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,740
anything really major just to bring up

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:11,230
at this point ok we can people know to

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,139
go to the link all right so on

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,379
extensions there's quite a bit but I'll

00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:18,970
put a link to the latest PMC updates but

00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,809
basically all the different projects are

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,629
moving along

00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:26,170
I think things to highlight or the

00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:28,480
autoscaler is adding a UI so look for

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,999
that soon if you are a user of that app

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,499
autoscaler I would say talk to ping

00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:38,559
bullying or go to their channel the VBR

00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:41,170
added sort of like improvements like

00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,569
blobstore backup impact reducing that as

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,519
well as a lot of supporting more

00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:50,589
external blob stores the package project

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,480
they are going to some kind of like

00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,980
figuring out what what's going on for

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,550
version 2 which is a reimplementation

00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,949
and go so if you look for some kind of

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:02,050
an inception on this soon you got an

00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:04,870
update for service fabric last time and

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:07,990
then as I mentioned Stephens divine on

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,249
pivotal is kicking ass all kinds of

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,220
stuff around so you have to have it

00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:13,959
local you check it out if you have it

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,149
looked at those projects I think they

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,120
make the experience in Kathmandu a lot

00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:22,740
easier and then of course the Stratis

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,740
project probably the highlight of

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,769
extensions is sort of just giving

00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:32,410
everybody a chance to sort of build

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:35,230
Cloud Foundry offerings I know for a

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,449
fact that IBM we're using it so check it

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,790
out and then blockhead

00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:42,970
you will get more at Summit so that's it

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:46,899
for extensions I'll put a link to to be

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,980
update so you can see things so I won't

00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,170
take any more questions right now

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,339
because we got a move to

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:56,309
- the two talks very exciting very

00:15:53,339 --> 00:16:00,239
important talks first we'll start with

00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:03,929
pivotal this is an update so to be clear

00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:05,579
Shannon is one of because the PM leaving

00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:10,230
all this I pinged him he couldn't be

00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:12,389
there so we have kuba who's gonna was I

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,549
guess the technical lead in there so

00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:17,689
she's gonna give us an update on what's

00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:20,429
going on there related to East you and

00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:24,809
inboard rhotic so true by if you want to

00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:27,509
share your screen yeah I also wanna

00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:36,839
clarify that I'm not one of the co PM's

00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:38,730
on shouting so yeah I'll try my best to

00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:43,290
answer all your technical questions but

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:45,959
don't take it to the bank but yeah so I

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,790
am sharing my screen I'm not hoping to

00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:51,269
get into presentation mode because it'll

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:54,989
I can't see all of you if I do that so I

00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:56,730
I don't have like we we have basic HTTP

00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:59,730
routing set up with is here right now so

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:03,749
my demo is not going to be as exciting

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,970
as I would like it to be but I hope that

00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:08,069
this sets the stage for future demos

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,600
from our team and gives you a little bit

00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:13,279
of a background on what our team is

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,860
working on and where we are right now so

00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:19,769
to step through like there are

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,559
motivations for using SEO in cloud

00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:24,269
foundry and especially within the

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,649
routing team we believe that this will

00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:27,419
help us deliver value to our users

00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:30,570
faster over the years the routing team

00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:33,120
has a long list of features that our

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,679
customers have requested us for and

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,620
we've been successful in delivering

00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,480
these in a nitrated way but we believe

00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,639
that you know is tio and envoy being

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,700
fairly feature-rich will actually help

00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:48,000
us deliver those features faster and we

00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,649
actually shared out proposal in the

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,299
beginning of the year and I have a link

00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:53,639
to this and the presentation I'll share

00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:55,470
it out later which details out our

00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,269
motivations and assumptions and all of

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,080
that so that will give you a better idea

00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:03,000
of what and why we wanted to do this

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,480
other than just features I think it

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,700
also helps us think about a lot of

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,290
runtime teams have been thinking about

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,420
how we can provide shared services

00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,570
between CFC our and CFAR and we hope

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,790
this is probably one way we can do that

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,710
it also helps us simplify the Cloud

00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,720
Foundry routing architecture and I'll go

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,800
into that in more detail as to how it

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,420
does that so in terms of how the Cloud

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,030
Foundry routing data plane works today

00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,670
this is a very simple illustration of it

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,770
you typically have a load balance the go

00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:39,660
router for HTTP routing in an app and

00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:41,700
the and domain balance we have a

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,340
parallel routing plane for TCP routing

00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,500
which is load balance or the TCP router

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:50,820
and app and you have domain for the TCP

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,470
router so this is how it works today how

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,450
we have set it up in our test

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,790
environments is that we have sort of

00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:00,030
this parallel routing plane that uses

00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:02,490
envoy as for edge routing and we have

00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:07,230
another domain map to the Envoy in front

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:09,300
of the we have another domain map to the

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,610
load balancer in front of the Envoy so

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,210
if you look at my screen to the right

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:17,520
now you can see that I already have a

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,530
deployment running and you can see that

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,840
we have in addition to all the VMS we

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,820
have these three VMs the east you

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,980
control VM the East your router the ants

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,590
this your router VMs are basically the

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,810
Envoy VMs and the is to control VM has

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,730
pilot and co-pilot you also have

00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:35,940
something called the CC route sinker

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:38,310
which is a bulk syncing job helps sync

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,460
routes between CC and co-pilot and I'll

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:43,740
go into that the next slide so that's

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,510
how it looks like in practice

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,270
and that's how we've set it up and we're

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,330
hoping that you know for experimental

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,370
purposes that would this would help us

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:56,250
until on we get to feature parity and

00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,350
envoy this will help us test and get new

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:02,820
features out to customer customers and

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:07,980
users so this is how the CF routing

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:10,740
control plane looks like today we have

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,110
the the route emitter gets routes from

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,350
the cloud controller 30 a go BBS to the

00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:20,000
route emitter and this is not completely

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,680
efficient in that Diego actually passes

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,650
on information it really doesn't have to

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,750
know these droughts get to the nads and

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,520
the go router gets those routes from the

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,350
Nats and this is basically for HTTP

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,500
routing for TCP routing there's the

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:36,080
routing API and the TCP router so we

00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,690
have two routers right now one for HTTP

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:44,090
routing and one for TCP routing the TCP

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:47,540
router is a proxy on behind the hood but

00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,940
it's not I mean it basically we have two

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:53,300
routing planes right now for two types

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:58,640
of two protocols so this is how it would

00:20:53,300 --> 00:21:01,880
look like with SEO and envoy so we have

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,340
simplified this by copilot which is an

00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,760
adapter we've written that talks to a co

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,750
pilot and co-pilot gets interacts with

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,060
both route controller and iego to get

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,940
the information and needs and eventually

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:21,220
we can also eliminate route emitter we

00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:24,680
already can remove Nats and routing API

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:28,580
this also means that we have only one

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:31,400
router so on why already supports HTTP

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:36,290
and TCP and there are plans to support

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:39,500
UDP but it's not in there yet so this

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:44,120
does help us in having just one instead

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:48,770
of two routers yeah and it cleans up the

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:53,330
orchestration layer by basically copilot

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:56,150
synching with CC and Diego directly so

00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:59,300
that's that basically is how we've

00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,430
implemented it right now I won't go into

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,670
the implementation details here but

00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:07,970
because I want to like go through a demo

00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:10,280
but yeah up until now we've contributed

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,380
back to the sto community in terms of

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,540
the sto gateway brought people the first

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:20,720
ones to get to want to use on was a

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:23,150
ingress gateway and you know using its

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,610
tier for it so we contributed that back

00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,980
to the stereo community we have basic

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,309
HTTP routing setup through on one I will

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,379
walk through that we

00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:34,719
also have the Cloud Foundry end-to-end

00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:36,359
test and pilot as part of their

00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:39,369
pipelines so if there is something that

00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:41,820
commit to pilot that breaks our

00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:45,700
integration we actually can catch it

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:48,369
before it impacts us and you know have

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,830
liked it there is more visibility into

00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:52,539
it for us we are also contributing

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,960
something called the mesh config

00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:58,419
protocol which basically if you look at

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:02,229
this interaction between copilot and Sto

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:04,749
pilot it it provides standard interfaces

00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:06,489
for copilot and pilot copilot or any

00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:09,099
other adapter right not just a Cloud

00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:11,739
Foundry adapter to interact with pilot

00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:13,570
and in the long run this will actually

00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:16,269
help us move faster because it moves

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:19,059
some of the code that we have in pilot

00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:21,190
today into copilot and also in terms of

00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:23,200
future integrations like we don't have

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,309
to make PRS to pilot we can just make

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,629
changes to copilot

00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:30,700
and that standard interface helps us in

00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:33,190
interacting with pilots so we are

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,919
contributing that work back into the sto

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,919
community we are focused on scaling of

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,419
the control plane and we will be we are

00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,009
I think one of the few teams which are

00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,349
actually testing the control plane as

00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:46,359
opposed to the data plane I think the

00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:50,739
SEO community has done a lot of work in

00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:53,259
terms of testing envoy and mixer for as

00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:54,609
data plane components for latency and

00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:56,289
throughput but there's not a lot of

00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:58,629
teams that are testing the control plane

00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:00,940
so we've been testing the controller and

00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:04,619
we've gotten to about 500 routes and 500

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:07,690
app instances which is not much but even

00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:11,019
then at every level we've found issues

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:14,679
with our integration either with our

00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:16,690
integration or in pilot itself and we

00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,479
fix some issue some of those issues have

00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:24,210
been fixed by the sto community

00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:26,320
themselves and yeah that's that's the

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:28,989
that's one of the bigger things we're

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,759
doing we also are working on weighted

00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:33,339
routing or traffic management features

00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:34,899
and we hope like that by next month

00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:37,779
we'll actually have something to demo

00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:41,019
there I have a bunch of resources here

00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:42,489
and I'll share it out so folks can go

00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:43,900
through it but the issue really is is

00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:48,010
basically the

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:50,590
Chili's that we have which has copilot

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:54,510
pilot and the components that we are

00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:57,370
using and you can get the tires with it

00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,260
so when we actually started this work we

00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:03,100
had a set of near-term goals and one of

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:05,970
it was to use to be able to do the book

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:10,240
info demo which is a canonical example

00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:12,070
that the SEO community uses so we've

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,950
actually been able to set it up except

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:17,140
we don't have transparent TLS between

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,910
apps in the service mesh and we still

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,640
don't have weighted routing so I'll go

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:23,740
through that in a second before I can

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,420
just give you a brief background of what

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,970
the book info demo looks like if you

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,790
haven't seen it so it's basically a

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,620
bunch of you know micro-services the

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,330
product page interacts with the reviews

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,550
page and the details page to get

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,940
information and then there's a ratings

00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:41,470
app that actually sends back the ratings

00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:45,070
to the reviews up and there are three

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:47,860
versions of the reviews app we only have

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,990
one version currently in our demo that

00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,360
we've set up because we are not doing

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:55,000
weighted routing yet so this is

00:25:52,360 --> 00:26:00,100
basically a canonical example the sto

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,750
community has been using and I have this

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:09,310
set up already so if you look at

00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:13,270
actually domains I have two domains here

00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:15,310
the sto dot sto acceptance domain is

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:18,310
what is mapped to the Envoy gateway in

00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:20,650
my environment and I already have pushed

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:24,370
the product rating reviews in details

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:29,860
app I've mapped the product page to the

00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:32,230
sto domain and I have like internal the

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,270
the reviews ratings in detail apps

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:39,670
mapped to the internal domain I also

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:45,070
have network policies set so think it's

00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:46,810
I also have network policy set for the

00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,990
product page to talk to details the

00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:52,090
product page to talk to reviews and the

00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,980
reviews to talk to ratings and like I

00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,020
said I'm instead of having three

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,309
versions of reviews I only have one

00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:03,620
version of review set in my

00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:05,720
environment and that basically the way

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,960
this pans out is that if I open the

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,880
product page I can see that you know

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,420
there's a page which has book reviews

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,360
and it reads from the ratings app and we

00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:20,660
only have reviews v3 which basically

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,780
shows red stars and non black stars and

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:28,160
no stars so you can see that this is

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:31,730
pulling out the information from the

00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,860
reviews v3 application so that's that's

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:36,620
basically all I have in terms of a demo

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:43,550
I'm happy to take questions and try and

00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:46,300
answer them we have a few minutes so if

00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,300
you guys have questions

00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:53,960
I went I was great Sheila Thanks yeah so

00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:55,369
I have a question I guess you just prime

00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,259
the pump so that people can ask a

00:27:55,369 --> 00:28:03,429
similar question you say you don't have

00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:04,669
to waited I guess living but

00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:09,379
prospectively

00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:15,469
end-user what what besides like seeing

00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:17,629
these two woods and so on is there a way

00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:21,769
for you to do kind of like Bluegreen yet

00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:23,419
or kind of the kind of thing that you

00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:26,119
can do in kubernetes where is you

00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:28,039
specify you know how much of the traffic

00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:32,779
goes here and there or is it and you're

00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:35,269
gonna have the waited yeah I I think I

00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:37,729
so your question is is there a way to do

00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:39,440
blue cleaned up twice right now I also

00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:40,969
thought you were trying to ask me what

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,279
the user experience might look like

00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,839
maybe also yeah but maybe two separate

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,899
questions or anyway

00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:48,499
yeah so there isn't a way to do that

00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:50,479
right now

00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:53,419
they are hoping we'll get there by next

00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:55,099
month we actually already I mean I think

00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:59,089
we have stories on our backlog that

00:28:55,099 --> 00:29:00,950
actually are too hard you like implement

00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:02,809
that but we put in a lot of thought into

00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,659
it we have a proposal that's out there

00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:07,700
for beta charting and the user

00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:10,039
experience for that so we have like

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,339
thought through I think one of the

00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:16,669
questions we were trying to deal with is

00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:18,200
how would a user interact with sto under

00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:19,669
the hood right and for us I think it's

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,379
to you as more of an implementation

00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:25,159
detail and from our research what we've

00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:28,039
seen is that for 80% of the users I

00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:31,009
think like they would want to interact

00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:32,719
with CF like user experience so it's

00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:34,789
either through the manifest or through

00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:37,789
the CFC Li that they would specify

00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:39,859
weights and be able to do specify

00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:44,089
weights to like how do they want to

00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:46,279
manage traffic and that's the experience

00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:49,489
we are thinking about right now but I

00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:52,820
think that's not something we've exposed

00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:55,219
as of now we're hoping to do it I think

00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:59,200
by like in a month's time we will have

00:29:55,219 --> 00:30:01,120
something there to demo but yeah

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,130
that's basically it you also have a

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,490
proposal I can share that out it's

00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:08,890
linked in the presentation I have which

00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:11,140
talks about in detail about the Cappy

00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,880
considerations and like where we are

00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,140
with it all the options so we've

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,690
considered the option of either

00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,510
percentages or numeric weights and what

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:22,630
works so yeah I'm happy to share that

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:26,350
out cool thank you thank you any other

00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:27,580
questions anybody maybe you only want

00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,990
that question

00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:34,600
okay so I'll ask it it's an easy one I'm

00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:37,480
assuming the Bosch release for East you

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:40,510
supports the version 1.0 right or it's

00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:46,450
your you behind up no I think you're on

00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:48,160
1.0 okay okay I guess I don't see any

00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:53,980
question do we see anything on the track

00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:56,350
movie no all right maybe maybe well

00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:00,010
question max so if I if I want to try

00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:01,390
this out is it just just applying the

00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,520
Bosch release is setting up a separate

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:06,870
router is there more magic to it I'm

00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:10,150
guessing this is document it summarized

00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:12,430
no yeah it is documented it is I think

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,380
you have to set this up with the CF

00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:16,960
deployment so I will share the link out

00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,520
and I think that's all you have to do it

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,770
has all the details about how you can

00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:26,130
set it up and you'll have to set up your

00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:26,130
load balancer with the domain sure okay

00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:36,070
yes so I have a few I have had some

00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,140
really great insight I've also had

00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:42,550
people quite concerned about that

00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:45,130
performance scale at 50 M and I wonder

00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:47,100
what we're what we're doing sounds like

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,180
performance testing or like what kind of

00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:55,180
scalability sauce we've had about it

00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:55,990
yeah so yeah I mean I think we've like I

00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,910
said we've

00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,890
I mean we've set up our framework to

00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,600
test but we are doing it I'd rative lis

00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,800
so we started I mean if you started with

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,480
50 thousand routes

00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,760
I mean sure everything is pretty Drake

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,370
and not just in terms of like on the

00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,590
side but even with our integration so we

00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,999
have we have a frameworks there and we

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,519
have started we started with like

00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:18,909
200 yards 500 yards and so on and we

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:21,759
obviously want to get to Cloud Foundry

00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:25,539
scale but that seems a little further

00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:27,729
off you know the issue like I know IBM

00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:30,399
is actually doing a lot of work in

00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:36,729
scaling and performance testing IBM are

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:40,419
great but I like I said I don't think a

00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:42,279
lot of folks are testing the control

00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:45,099
playing components there is a lot of

00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:47,409
testing in the mixer and envoy like

00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:49,839
testing on one mixer but not a lot in

00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:51,099
the control plane components and also

00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,169
I'll use case is a little different

00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:55,659
right you are creating like hundreds of

00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:57,309
virtual services which are like those

00:32:55,659 --> 00:33:00,069
route rules that they used to call

00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,929
previously and we are like updating them

00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:05,439
very frequently so we actually found

00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:07,989
like that itself is not you know very

00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:12,609
efficient in sto so I definitely think

00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:14,679
that that is a risk and we are keeping

00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:16,629
an eye on it we both like both Shannon

00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:18,399
and I attend the performance and working

00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:20,199
group committee meetings and I think

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,699
that's a good place for us to start

00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:24,819
chiming in

00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:27,429
I like NIMH also in the routing team

00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:30,189
experimented with actually having a pair

00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:33,399
that contributes to a steal and works on

00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:36,549
like upstream sto components if you've

00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:39,789
just not like come to scaling as our

00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:44,919
priority yet but I think there will be a

00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:47,109
point where all right I guess that's my

00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:50,379
kind of my worry is I think a lot of

00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:52,379
people get loads of value this nobody's

00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:54,369
know me because kubernetes not multi

00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:56,439
normally in like relatively small

00:33:54,369 --> 00:34:03,819
clusters and then you've got like you

00:33:56,439 --> 00:34:07,209
know the big multi pending yeah I feel

00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:09,549
like we I mean we will as we test I

00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:11,319
trade early we we are hoping to fix

00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:14,349
issues I'd rative lee but there is a

00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:17,710
like I think bigger discussion yeah run

00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:20,369
scaling all right thank you sure about

00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:23,890
and talking about East you and scaling

00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:27,790
we have on the cold this time

00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:30,130
mesh who is manager for the open

00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:33,120
technology at IBM and somebody in his

00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:36,760
team is working on that Chris yes

00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:39,370
Channel Luciano anyways Christopher his

00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:44,530
channel so maybe it's worth introducing

00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:47,470
offline max good point and also suited

00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:50,320
in IBM he is doing some wonderful work

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:52,570
on these GS scaling exactly Cummins

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,800
testing with some of the folks from the

00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:58,990
other sto members so I think they are in

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,420
a process of finalizing the details for

00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:05,290
that performance report and as soon as

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:07,240
it is ready we will yeah we are actually

00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,400
already in touch with Sonia and we have

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,680
regular meetings set up with him so we

00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:16,260
meet with him like once I think it's a

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,910
once a month right now all right perfect

00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,520
everybody knows each other so cool thank

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,680
you so much we share that okay so the

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,420
next call the next talk and I guess

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,610
tools you'll have 22 minutes nobody

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,960
doesn't need an introduction

00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:34,930
he has opinion about everything and

00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:45,430
they're all right like how it what are

00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:48,190
the odds being right about Irina which

00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:50,620
is the back end foundation so ticket you

00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:53,590
have to share your screen yes so so

00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:56,590
actually and this is this is even better

00:35:53,590 --> 00:36:00,100
than just the single Jules presentation

00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:01,510
this is a double Jules presentation I'm

00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,890
gonna I'm gonna talk for just a minute

00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:06,460
or two and then I'm going to hand over

00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:09,570
to another Jules we are really a real

00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:13,270
actual demo and so you you should all

00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:15,720
recognize how lucky you are this is this

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:18,520
is rare it's like a double rainbow and

00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,380
so the thing that we're going to show

00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,690
you and and I'm just going to talk for

00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,070
like a second just set some context then

00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,100
we just want to show you some working

00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:30,090
stuff because it's quite cool it's

00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:34,080
actually a tool for kubernetes users

00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:36,310
what we want is to provide a tool to

00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,329
kubernetes operates and developers it

00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:40,059
gives them

00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:42,700
a rapid application development workflow

00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:49,209
for 12 factor apps and we're calling it

00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:50,650
Cloud Foundry but of course with a k' of

00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:54,430
course it's clarified you with a cave

00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:58,420
that's what that's what we've so he

00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:59,950
named anything anymore it's not really

00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,249
cool clap I drew the K I just thought I

00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:05,799
was hilarious I came up with that the

00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:07,779
start of this call and now part of me

00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:12,609
wants to make actually the name of the

00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:15,579
projects let's discuss that after so the

00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:17,319
idea is if you like we've got this

00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:18,910
amazing workflow which we're all really

00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,319
happy about with like Diego and Bosch

00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,259
all this stuff but you have the

00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:25,569
kubernetes community kind of slowly kind

00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:27,130
of reinventing some of that stuff but

00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:30,339
actually be really nice to offer them an

00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:32,859
easy way to get that CF user experience

00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:34,809
to try it out to see you know that that

00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:39,700
workflow that I think most people on

00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:44,049
this call kind of love right and so

00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:46,180
that's what this does this is a plugin

00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:47,469
basically for the cloud controller so

00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,930
you've got all the same cloud controller

00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:52,269
api's everything works its normal but it

00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:54,999
enables the scheduler bits to be

00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:57,999
pluggable and so you can choose to use

00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:59,469
kubernetes instead of diego for actually

00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:01,269
scheduling your containers if you

00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:03,910
already have skills and stuff with

00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:07,390
kubernetes which means you get a kind of

00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:09,670
smaller amount of CF to manage and maybe

00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:11,469
maybe let someone else's let that

00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:15,459
especially be someone else's problem you

00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:17,739
schedule as a service or whatever so I'm

00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:19,029
gonna I'm going to hand over to the demo

00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:19,660
and we'll have hoped me a bit of time

00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:25,140
for questions

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:29,799
okay what's the last thing easy this is

00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:31,479
also Jules but but so I I happen to have

00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:38,890
a doctorate so everyone calls me dr.

00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:42,640
Jules Jules scooping Jack I think it's

00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:45,420
so you you pronounce it scoop neck it's

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,140
a heart it's a heart but you can say is

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,140
this convey Jules

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,740
on our team I I go by dr. Jules and

00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:59,650
Jules those by hey Jules

00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,990
since he's based in Germany so we'll go

00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:03,660
by hey Jules and Dom toodles so that for

00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,850
the purposes of this call they think

00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:10,990
okay can you can you scream I guess

00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:13,150
Jules number two of course I can hey

00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:20,020
come be tools number two that's terrible

00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:23,050
yeah right it's better okay so I think I

00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,380
will just die run into the demo just

00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,760
because we don't have too much time

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,910
because there's a few things that I want

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,820
to show so I guess everybody is seeing

00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:36,880
my terminal now yeah I have four paints

00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:42,280
and I did a I did some preparation for

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:45,090
that so just for our setup we have Bosch

00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,560
light on SoftLayer and we have also a

00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:51,220
grenadiers fast on SoftLayer our arena

00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,800
component is currently running for

00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,720
development reasons on kubernetes as a

00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,530
container but they are connected with

00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,660
foundry and what I did here is a watch

00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:05,260
on the coop get pots so you can you can

00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:08,980
see what's going on on the cluster the

00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:12,730
second app here is actually Rini I call

00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:16,450
the Domini and the other one is one

00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:18,940
running app one running cff on the right

00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:21,130
side you see it is stateful sets of

00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:26,710
communities because we deploy everything

00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:30,760
a stateful set so in the lower left pane

00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:33,970
I will perform a CF push and yeah and do

00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:41,040
the other demos so I think we just start

00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:41,040
to push Dora let's say demo

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:54,550
and the staging is actually performed on

00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:57,590
Diigo currently we could also do it on

00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:59,840
with a rainy but we currently don't have

00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:03,560
this dream of deluxe setup so that's why

00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:07,010
we decided to for now to use the diego

00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:10,060
staging but the app is going to be

00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:13,070
deployed on kubernetes and you will see

00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:16,730
after staging that the app will actually

00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:18,490
appear on kubernetes so just give it

00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:23,840
another second

00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:25,310
everything is staged awesome so you

00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,680
already see that the container is

00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:34,730
getting created and it's already running

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:38,480
and so we last week passed the smoke

00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:40,610
tests actually and I will just see there

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,130
show the features that arena is

00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:46,550
currently supporting DCF features so for

00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:52,060
example we could say stop so let's first

00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:55,910
show our apps you should see also the

00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:57,170
demo app here awesome and we will now

00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,050
see f-stop

00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:03,920
for example the demo app and you should

00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:10,220
see that it's disappearing right it's

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:14,510
terminating and cff should still show

00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:20,270
that it's there but stopped right and we

00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:22,420
could also say CF starts demo to start

00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,420
it again

00:42:25,049 --> 00:42:32,170
which will bring the app back up and

00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:34,390
kubernetes so it says here running and

00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:39,940
of course the container is running again

00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:44,109
and as we can do see f-stop and CF start

00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:46,559
a CF restart also works so I hope you

00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:48,729
believe me so I need to do that now

00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:52,749
which will basically stop the app and

00:42:48,729 --> 00:43:00,039
start its so the next thing is of course

00:42:52,749 --> 00:43:02,999
we can see F scale apps demo let's say

00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:02,999
for instances

00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:14,070
so you should see the same app like four

00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:17,130
times so here this and of course you can

00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:19,260
see it when you do a sea of apps you see

00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:24,030
the instance count the correct instance

00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:31,140
count and also we can scale it back to

00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:33,150
one app so terminating the apps they

00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:38,690
should also report the correct instance

00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:46,500
count and of course we can curl our it

00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:53,750
CF just curl demo great I can just copy

00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:58,290
the link and there we go hi I'm Dora

00:43:53,750 --> 00:44:02,220
which is awesome and we are currently

00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:04,730
working on the Rattus Rattus integration

00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:08,820
which is log regatta on kubernetes and

00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:12,360
we can also use the loCash to show the

00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:18,540
logs and that should also work so for

00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:22,590
example if you use lakh cash tail and

00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:30,230
then we need the app goo it's CF help

00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:34,710
demo geo ID and put it here let's do

00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:40,740
some more curls because I'm on every

00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:44,910
curl I do some locks and if we know lock

00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:47,760
has tail you see deluxe and if I curl

00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:49,980
again you see that there should be a lot

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,340
more just that you believing in them not

00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,340
lying

00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:55,470
so here's till last look and you can

00:44:53,340 --> 00:45:00,660
also do it with CF tail actually so you

00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:03,450
can say CF tail demo and it should also

00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:05,880
show you all the locks which is also

00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:11,970
really nice we are not a hundred percent

00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:17,549
finished with that but close to and yeah

00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:21,809
I think that was the demo for today

00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:22,589
yeah I think if there is there any

00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:26,609
questions

00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:29,940
Jules dr. Jules will answer all your

00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:32,599
questions I'm gonna pre answer one

00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,950
question so I know that someone will ask

00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:38,430
because it's why I would ask how many

00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:41,490
cats are passing it's a little less than

00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:44,960
50% of the cats passing at the moment

00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:49,589
and we're we're we're cracking through

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,890
the remaining ones we we we think

00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:55,349
there's a pretty manageable amount of

00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:58,260
stuff to get to 100 percent of the cool

00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:59,579
cats and a hundred seven the cool cats

00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,780
is the point where will will start

00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:06,510
saying to people hey you might actually

00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:07,589
want to try this out typically that's

00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,819
the core cats and not things like

00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:12,119
container networking which we're not

00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:13,500
going to do to begin with yeah here's

00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,049
the proof for the smoke test actually

00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:19,140
wanted to show that that the smoke tests

00:46:16,049 --> 00:46:22,020
are actually passing and we can also run

00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:24,240
them well there are any questions and

00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:27,930
there's also one other thing that I

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:31,529
wanted to show is that for everybody who

00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:34,799
wants to try out ireenie we have a

00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:38,339
script and that we are also continuously

00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:42,510
testing on our arena release repository

00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:44,750
and there are also call instructions how

00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:50,010
you can deploy it on your local machine

00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:53,549
using we books both lights and mini coop

00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:55,349
and it's actually just executing a

00:46:53,549 --> 00:47:00,720
script which is here in this group

00:46:55,349 --> 00:47:02,970
folder and it has all these steps we try

00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,819
to make it really readable so you can

00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:08,700
see what needs to be done to do that if

00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:11,309
you want to do it manually and you can

00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,869
go to all the functions and try to do it

00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:16,559
yourself manually if you don't like to

00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:19,470
run the scripts however if you just want

00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:24,799
to easily deploy you really just use the

00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:27,510
scripts as documented on the readme and

00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:30,750
try it out yourself on your local

00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:33,740
machine ok that's that

00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:36,180
yeah thank you so let's start I guess

00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:38,940
some questions first thing is Thank You

00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,830
Jules and I guess dr. Jules and Jules

00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,570
you can call the stubble Jules if you

00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:48,180
like is that this is I guess a European

00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:51,840
effort between IBM and SATA and

00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:53,369
obviously it would be happy to have your

00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,099
contribution if you're interested to

00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:58,050
ping them I believe Simon Moser is also

00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:01,560
on the call so there's a kind of like

00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:02,790
the big team doing this so let's open it

00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,320
for questions we have 9 minutes we don't

00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,700
have to use the whole nine minutes but

00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:08,910
you know hopefully we have more

00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,630
questions I have some questions but I'll

00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:12,750
wait

00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:14,160
anybody talk to Jules it's Troy what do

00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,830
you anticipate is gonna be the the

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,450
trickiest thing coming up to pass all

00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:21,810
the cats

00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:24,990
I don't anticipate any problems and we

00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:26,460
actually have I should dig out you can

00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:31,950
even have a look at our tracker actually

00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:34,920
and there's a list we have we have a

00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:36,810
list of the stories that we need to do

00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,450
to complete cats it's actually although

00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:41,520
there's about 40 cats left a lot of them

00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:45,510
are kind of saying they're all like one

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,950
test so we have a list of the stories

00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:50,310
that are coming up and we have them

00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:51,990
prioritized in order of the firt the

00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,910
first ones are kind of like that the

00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:56,849
things that you really would want and

00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:58,980
let me see if I can find it and then

00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:00,060
there's a few that are I wouldn't say

00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,200
there they're going to be problems

00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:05,550
nothing seems like it's going to be a

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:08,040
huge problem that we can see but there's

00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:14,010
a couple things where we're not actual

00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:17,510
on each more Rubin CF kind of different

00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:20,190
so an example of that it's a better cat

00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:22,109
which asserts that if you don't have

00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,420
enough resources you get an error

00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:27,030
message in the CLI saying resources

00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,230
insufficient resources and that's just

00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,580
super hard to do in kubernetes

00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,369
kubernetes doesn't really have the

00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:34,740
concept of not having enough resources

00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:36,869
because it's kind of all asynchronous in

00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,880
kubernetes and it just kind of will

00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:42,390
retry into other our resources actually

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,010
see what I mean so we probably won't be

00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,960
able to pass a test that says say

00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:47,520
insufficient

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,860
but I kind of feel like that's an

00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,800
operator concern like in a in a

00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:54,960
kubernetes environment when see if

00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,700
signals up kubernetes you've got an

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,220
operator worrying about making sure that

00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:01,230
there are resources and so if the error

00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,730
is just like timed out which it will be

00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,980
in that case you'll just get a timeout

00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:06,870
I've been packing time rather than like

00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,090
an explicit insufficient resources like

00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,700
Diego can tell you I don't think that's

00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:14,310
a huge thing so it's it's a couple of

00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:17,160
things like that where I think we

00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:19,410
probably won't want to pass those cats

00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,570
there's two or three cats which we think

00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:23,160
they're just they're just representative

00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:26,420
with just a different way of working

00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,620
we may be criminally should do it but

00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,380
maybe I think it's one of those

00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:34,890
fundamental differences in kubernetes

00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:37,740
like this kind of convergence of states

00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:40,290
rather than kind of imperative nuts

00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,850
where it might be relatively difficult

00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:43,620
it's not impossible to implement it

00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:45,360
could implement it you could you can

00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:47,850
loop over the loans and see if they have

00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:49,590
enough resource and send the error

00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:55,230
messages you just would feel wrong you

00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:59,970
see what I mean okay any other questions

00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:03,870
comments yeah just a quick question

00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:06,270
this is Jillian yard sorry I think I

00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:09,200
might win the competition for the joy in

00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:13,260
with the lease pronounceable last name

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,220
it's quite a quite a big competition

00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,980
here it's quiet

00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,730
yeah it here Jules has given me a run

00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:22,020
for my money

00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:25,050
I'm not really accustomed to it but so

00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,610
in terms of like what happens in staging

00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:28,080
I think you've answered this in a talk

00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:30,890
before but I don't remember the answer

00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:34,410
so I'll ask it again

00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:36,480
are you running a is it is it a similar

00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:38,610
flow to Diego where essentially you put

00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,980
out kind of a blank stainer and then

00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:44,910
pipe the app into it as a droplet and

00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:46,710
then start it up or were you actually

00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:49,670
building our container with the app

00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:53,160
fully baked into it we leave me off so

00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:54,780
although all this the staging site stuff

00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,980
still works with droplets because that's

00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,320
the best way of keeping all the Cloud

00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,690
Controller API is consistent so you can

00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,829
still

00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,750
do things like roll back to a previous

00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:03,730
version of the droplets which is one of

00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:05,890
them cloud controller features so all of

00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:09,579
the staging stuff still works with

00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:10,690
droplets but at runtime we converts the

00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:13,390
droplet into an image

00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:15,460
so everything that kubernetes is an

00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:19,540
image and it's an image that we

00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:21,430
construct based on the route FS plus the

00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:23,200
droplets we just basically build an

00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:25,960
image it describes the routes of s plus

00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,599
the droplets and then we use that for

00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,550
all the kubernetes side stuff but it's

00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:32,440
using the droplet that Cece thinks that

00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,480
should have and the route defense that's

00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,280
the current deployed booth of us so kind

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,569
of issue it the best of both worlds if

00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,410
you see what I mean and and Brett is

00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:44,290
asking just even the vines work to be

00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:47,680
coupled the pipes and CF yes and not

00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:49,569
only that but hey Jules was mentioning

00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,730
that at the moment for the demo we use

00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:53,650
Diego to do the staging because we had a

00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:56,800
nice log and tailing on there at the

00:52:53,650 --> 00:53:01,240
moment if you turn on staging in arena

00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,280
it actually uses Stevens packs so here's

00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:06,040
his repo with the decomposed Bill packs

00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,920
to do the staging so we run that in a

00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:13,780
job inside kubernetes and upload a

00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,940
droplet at the end to do staging yeah

00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:19,450
and not to not just you

00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:21,730
Cody Cooper but this is pretty much

00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:24,430
exactly what this project called

00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:27,930
key native me training I've been working

00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:31,210
on this and there is like a build that

00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:33,099
pretty much follows a similar process

00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:35,829
where it creates a container we do to

00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:38,710
build and build is slightly different

00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:41,680
build up build builds container images

00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:44,109
directly and it also uses packs and we

00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,869
in our build aren't building an image of

00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:49,710
we're building a drop a two years you

00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:52,930
you end up we do it the other way so so

00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:55,420
we build a droplet and then create an

00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:57,670
image dynamic and the advantage of that

00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:00,040
is it means you get all the patching

00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:01,450
stuff for free so when you deploy a new

00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,180
version of the root surface with the

00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:06,160
patches in it that's automatic we build

00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:08,170
we now can just dynamically create a new

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,329
image with the new routes of s and the

00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:11,870
droplet on top whereas if you do the

00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:14,030
build at staging

00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:16,970
get into an image you then just had a

00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:18,830
static unpassable black box image and so

00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:21,590
in order to maintain maybe you can't do

00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:23,780
the rollback stuff the CC has and the

00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:25,330
other that features the CC and so that's

00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:28,670
why we kind of stuck with with our

00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:32,170
staging and although I think a lot of

00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:34,520
this works all quite nicely right like

00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:37,220
we're using packs to generate that

00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:39,260
droplets you can use packs in K native

00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,760
so however you you're now going to be

00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:44,390
able to use bill packs of generate

00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:46,730
images in all sorts of contexts and so

00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:49,160
it's just it's just depends what what UX

00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:50,300
you want right like if you want Y and

00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,370
they're trying to compare any two I mean

00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,380
you know be time for this but I think I

00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:57,740
think just wanted to mention that this

00:54:54,380 --> 00:55:02,330
kind of technology I guess is being used

00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:05,390
other places yeah so so I and I think

00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:09,560
it's a really good way of thinking about

00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:12,080
things right it's like that the we're

00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:14,080
using packs generated droplets and then

00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:17,390
converting that to an image at runtime

00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:20,300
and the K Natick builds will build you

00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:22,870
an image directly yeah but you can have

00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:24,770
revisions on them and so on so it's yeah

00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:27,740
let's see if they are the question I

00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:33,110
don't want to dominate any other

00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:34,880
questions comments anybody okay I think

00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:37,820
the last thing to mention is that I

00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:43,220
believe most of these guys will be in

00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:45,290
Basel there is a talk I think or couple

00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:48,530
talks between Simon and doodles and

00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:51,470
Butch Jules around Canada and I believe

00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:53,000
there's even a panel where different

00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:55,130
folks are gonna be there like burn at

00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,020
Toronto if you're interested in this

00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:01,250
work especially if you're interested in

00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:04,580
trying it using it and hopefully helping

00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:06,680
them come to Baskerville movies and you

00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:09,170
said K mates if I think you meant Irina

00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:11,030
although I'm sure they also be panels

00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:15,260
but my bad

00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:18,950
I met Nene this is not a key native talk

00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:21,800
so sorry about that I met Nene so I

00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:23,360
think I think I think it like I think

00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,569
Linux is something people show so check

00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,569
out it's very cool but

00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:29,249
these are all all different new X's that

00:56:27,569 --> 00:56:33,479
can now start to sit on top of

00:56:29,249 --> 00:56:33,929
kubernetes slip of the tongue I guess 14

00:56:33,479 --> 00:56:36,989
slips

00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:39,509
may be alright if there is nothing

00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:41,189
nothing else we will call it a day Thank

00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:43,650
You Shuba and thank you

00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:46,829
both Jews and the rest of the teams I

00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:48,539
guess we'll talk again and September and

00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:55,979
after that in battle take it easy

00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:58,849
cheers back alright so you see how this

00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:58,849
