00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,800
starting engine Aries that I'll send a

00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,010
survey just like I did last year to

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,350
figure out how to do how to move forward

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,600
just to get your feedback and also

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,239
figuring out you know who should maybe

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,370
help me on this I'm happy to keep doing

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,809
it but sorry need other people that are

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,820
very capable and maybe you weren't

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,190
willing to do it so we'll do that and

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,739
also just to find out if the format

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,270
works in terms of the two talks and so

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,640
on so if you have feedback before the

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,140
survey feel free to send it to me if you

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,619
don't feel comfortable sending it to me

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,439
you have chip sworn out Chris Paul from

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,009
the cff feel free to ping them send them

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,509
out the spreadsheet I mean I feel you

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,790
should be able to talk to me but if you

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,229
somehow for some reason don't want to if

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,799
you're a very negative feedback that's

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,810
okay to send it this water and they'll

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,850
figure out a way to send it to me and

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,820
then we can report but I'll send a

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,100
official survey starting next so with

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,950
that let's pass it to swore now so you

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,689
can give us an update and yeah I know it

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,880
was a CF day in Seattle I saw you so

00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:49,290
yeah we saw you briefly and I do have a

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,860
lot of negative feedback about your

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,590
presence at CF day Seattle who should I

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,770
send that to max consider - my manager

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:03,090
but I did I did I did register and paid

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:07,530
for it so means not thing if you don't

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,410
show up man anyway won't take too much

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,110
time so we had a really good presence at

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,860
Seattle last week it was exhausting it

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,380
was long and

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,670
tiring but it was really good we had a

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,330
ton of volunteers from the community

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,040
from all different locations and regions

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,060
show up at the booth and spent time at

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,640
the booth helping answer any questions

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,400
that folks had at Cloud Foundry I mean I

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,040
had the at cube concert that was really

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,340
helpful and Max and the rest of the IBM

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,830
team

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,959
I think the keynote presence was

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:45,450
definitely timely and well it was

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,390
spot-on said that was also that drove a

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,650
ton of questions and ton of found

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,160
traffic and about the boots as well I

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,410
saw both IBM and Cloud Foundry booth and

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,080
I think even the rest of the club can

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,730
remember boots kind of being packed all

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,410
the time any time I went by this is it

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,910
we're all terrorists there everyone was

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,260
packed all the time so that was

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,530
definitely a good presence for all of

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,239
our ecosystem and the members so thank

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,540
you very much for making that extremely

00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,310
successful I do have a few updates that

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,739
I included in the document I mean not a

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:22,380
whole lot we will have the schedule open

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:24,660
for summit Philadelphia in January I

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,640
think the co-chairs are reviewing the

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,070
sessions that came in as we speak so

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,370
look for schedule being announced

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,200
sometime in mid-january the registration

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,480
is still open I mean it's already open

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,910
so if you want to register go for it the

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,769
contributors code has been sent to see

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,400
active so if you haven't registered if

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:47,670
you're a contributor please do look for

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,930
the email in the CF dev mailing list and

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,910
do use that code just one quick reminder

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,170
just a kind of logistics reminder that

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,549
we will be shut down the entire

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,000
foundation will be shut down for the

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:03,150
holidays from December 22nd to January

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,580
6th so if you have any burning question

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,500
please do ask before that some of us

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,510
will be checking email every now and

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,579
then I think someone here from the

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,090
foundation did volunteer to check email

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,590
every now and then but if you have any

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,780
questions and if you don't hear from us

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,760
in during that shutdown time I just

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,250
assumed that we were probably out of not

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,919
checking our emails then and with that

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,510
chip do you have anything to add yeah

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,480
the only thing I was gonna add was

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,630
I think a couple of thanks for an

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,830
awesome year so first you know the the

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,690
technical community they're

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,710
collaborators contributed here's the

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:43,650
committers project leads it's been an

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:48,110
amazing year you know we read of the

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,110
opportunity to talk to a lot

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:56,880
customers the different distributions as

00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,480
well as the swords and it's really

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,090
amazing to hear all all the great

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:07,290
feedback all kinds of different use

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:10,410
cases from the no work experience for

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:14,850
the application runtime that's been

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,530
really amazed and what's the year i'm

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,720
the other thing that i'd say that's been

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,880
kind of highlighted what your that we're

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,520
going to put more over in 2019 has been

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,120
just the continued activity around

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,670
embracing open source projects from

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,890
throughout the broader ecosystem because

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,680
i think that you know one of the the

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:43,440
most mature things that our technical

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:49,920
community does is kind of the right time

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:52,710
to adopt outside the point of either

00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,880
near maturity or mature when they're

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,260
near maturity you know we lean and

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,880
consistently into those communities and

00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,600
kind of help them get to the point of it

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,270
being a useful component of the CF

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,580
architecture and there's just been so

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,880
much of that work that's gone on both

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,690
bringing you know new capabilities in

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:22,650
the architecture but also things look

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:25,020
like taking fundamental to Cloud Foundry

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:28,500
and finding ways to make that work with

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,560
with other platforms so that's that's

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,380
been really amazing and it speaks to the

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,900
you know the openness of our technical

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,250
community to embrace other things to not

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,620
always have to build things ourselves

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,100
but also to build things ourselves when

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,110
it's

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,450
the right choice and so thanks to

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,770
everybody for all of that effort and I

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,600
think you know last thing I'll say is

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:52,260
doctor actually do an amazing job with

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,180
this this call you're here I agree that

00:06:52,260 --> 00:07:09,330
it's always good to you and pushing this

00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:11,100
forward so that's it yes it's a special

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,520
effect I turned onto the phone just for

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,270
you

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:20,400
nice all right cool

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:22,260
I think one question for us one out if

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,800
other people have question that stood up

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:29,550
quickly but I I've had two or three

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,410
people ask me if if I knew the count of

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,620
the submission the submission count for

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,080
Philadelphia you can you share you have

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,700
any numbers that you can share

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,150
especially because we we didn't have the

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:44,280
extra extension to did that affected

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,990
um I don't think it affected I think we

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,980
had a ton of submissions come in I think

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,450
I don't have the exact numbers of every

00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,520
night accessible but I will get those

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,550
numbers from Deb but I think we were as

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,800
close to Boston as we could we could

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,990
have imagined if not the exact number of

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,110
submissions we it the lack of extension

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,630
and also the holidays and the short does

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,670
or gap between the two summers the

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,340
October summit and the deadline here did

00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,590
not affect that at all so even we were

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,940
keeping our fingers crossed that it

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,350
would not affect and I think that was

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:22,640
that was thought on okay sweetie any

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:26,910
other question post one out very quickly

00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:29,310
no okay so the first speaker asks you

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,990
present now so this is Janos binder from

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,990
a CD so Janos

00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:39,930
yes yes just give me a second

00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:43,970
I just have to check a set of here the

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,970
technology's always a kind of challenge

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,760
[Music]

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:57,300
okay so thank you max oh I am unaware

00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,330
spinder and I'm working with sa P in my

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,950
role I have we have been responsible to

00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:09,000
deploy we are mostly in my team we are

00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:12,480
mostly cloud foundry users and we have

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,100
been developed micro services for

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,500
various machine learning problems and we

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:25,380
wanted to deploy it is these small

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:28,380
applications into into cloud foundry so

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:32,250
this is how I get into touch with cloud

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,950
foundry and we wanted to use we wanted

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:41,540
to use a provider can you hear me yes we

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:44,580
can hear and with us we know okay so so

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:49,560
so we have figured out that there is the

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:52,830
slice tool nice tool terraform which can

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:56,040
which is mostly used for for set of an

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:59,790
infrastructure so for example if you are

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:04,079
your abs or GCP truster terraform is

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:07,139
mostly one of the most sewers told to

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:11,940
set up the notes the fiber rules and so

00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:14,759
on and then this terraform is basically

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,290
using various providers and that I have

00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:21,509
been searching for a Cloud Foundry

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:29,670
provider and I have I have directly find

00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:35,399
a very nice one which is shared on yeah

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:38,190
I think we need to go in mute okay okay

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,870
so I just want to make clear that I will

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,699
show you some links but don't worry I

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,839
have already added these links to the

00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:52,310
meeting notes oh so you can check them

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:55,319
later and what I like really the this

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:59,910
this October that there was this cloud

00:10:55,319 --> 00:11:02,279
from the summit in Basel where I had the

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:06,389
chance to meet with with the people

00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:08,269
behind this behind this who have

00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:10,800
contributed to this provider for example

00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:14,279
Guillaume who is also in the core is

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,510
working for orange or maven is is

00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:22,730
working for people and both of us and

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:25,829
all of us have been have been have been

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,649
improving different price of the

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:31,440
provider for example I know that that

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:34,230
Melvin and Guillaume are more focused on

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,949
on making sure that they can set up a

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:40,980
fund the organization space and users we

00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:43,860
have been more focused on on setting up

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:48,149
cloud funding applications or service

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:51,839
instances so we have been working on

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:55,350
different parts of the provider I have

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:59,689
been also talking a bit that that we are

00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:04,410
deploying these micro services in in in

00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:07,110
in Cloud Foundry I want to give you a

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,480
short overview of our our architecture

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:13,520
and and tell you why

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:17,070
we have been using terraform so

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,310
basically we have we have we have

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:23,160
multiple tiers so we have here I don't

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,260
know if I use my use my mouse but you

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,250
can see that I'm using that but

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:31,620
basically we have a crowdfunded here

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,810
where we have this graph on the based

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,950
applications then we have a compute here

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:40,470
where we run our machine learning

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:43,800
machine learning services this one needs

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:47,190
mostly GPU accelerations and they are

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,470
running over over kubernetes and the

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,470
persistence tier has for example

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:57,570
sometimes we have to reach and region

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:59,100
and as we bucket on abs so this means

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:02,010
that that way when we deploy our

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,460
landscape we have to deploy over Cloud

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,350
Foundry we have to deploy over over

00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:13,440
kubernetes and we have to also deploy

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:15,390
over a vias which means that to support

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,670
these three landscapes then we needed a

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:25,310
tool and then terraform was the tool

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:25,310
that that had us fifties fifties issue

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,350
so this was basically from our

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,870
architectural overview and now I would

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:41,630
like to give a short introduction that

00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:46,020
that that how does how does does

00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:51,120
terraform works in the in the in the

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:53,100
real life so here I show you actually

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,100
this is a demo that Guillaume has

00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:01,110
prepared and I have adopted it for our

00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:03,150
for our SCP flat platform but you can

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:08,150
basically download this demo and then

00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:12,240
also try it on on your offering so here

00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:15,930
in in in here you can see the

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,460
configuration file I want to explain

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,690
that what is the difference between data

00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,120
and what is the difference between

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,040
resource so a data what is what is

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,490
already there

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,640
for example we have already defined a

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:32,940
space set up and we have also the

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:36,000
organization already set up and we have

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:42,960
also for example we have a we have a we

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,180
have a post gas process service where

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,920
you can you can see the various service

00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,800
offering that this is also coming from

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,300
the platform so we don't want to set up

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,130
over there are also this resources

00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,870
resources are the things that you when

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:59,370
you run terraform that you want to set

00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:03,060
up so here we want to set up a post gas

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,880
vehicle instance we also want to set up

00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:09,630
a set up a set up a route for our demo

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:15,390
application and we and we also want to

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:18,450
set up a set up a cloud foundry app and

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:23,760
let's see how does this work in the real

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:29,550
life so if I run this thing so how well

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:32,730
you can see my console can you still

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,190
make my soul I mean usually when you

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,930
have a when you have a Tara forms set up

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:40,050
then you start with the in it this

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:43,380
basically make sure that the providers

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,570
are in the power in the place and then

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,270
then you can say that okay Tara form

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:51,930
plan and then plan says that what's

00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:54,960
what's needs to be added and then if you

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:57,990
and then if we scroll through then you

00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,600
can see that we have to add the app we

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:06,150
have also have to add there at the root

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:09,990
and we also have to add at the service

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,940
instance for that postgis sequel so if I

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:16,350
check now you can see that nothing is

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:24,750
nothing is there and I can now quote our

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:26,550
form apply and then this is basically

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:32,130
for the plan that you see what is going

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:34,670
to get applied and then you see that I

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:37,300
say yes

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:40,280
and then this is now creating the route

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,770
the service instance and the application

00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:48,290
maybe in another window I can see that

00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:52,190
the application is now coming up the

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:54,500
service instance might be already

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:58,190
running so you see that it has been

00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:03,140
already created let's go back and let's

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:09,530
see what is going on it's all still

00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:11,690
setting up their application and what is

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,210
also really nice about terraform so

00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:16,790
basically terraform is a graph execution

00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:19,820
engine so it can it can see what kind of

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:22,550
dependencies do you have so before

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,800
setting up this app it knows that it

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,650
that it that the app will need a route

00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,410
and the earth will also need this

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,450
postgis service instance so it will set

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:39,140
up these first two first and then

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:42,890
afterwards the application ok so now we

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:46,940
should have the application and it's

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:49,660
running what what can also do what I

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,300
also like that for example you can do

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:56,420
some changes for example I could say

00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:59,180
that I want to deploy a new version of

00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:02,390
this application or I want to increase

00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:06,200
the memory for example here I increase

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:09,650
the memory to one gig let's save it and

00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:16,100
let's see what will happen and I say

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:18,680
again apply and let me say that all that

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:30,250
is that this application now needs more

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:34,840
memory let's update it probably is now

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,840
increasing the memory and restarting it

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,260
so I also have to edit as a side note

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,970
that that we really like in terraform

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,020
that you can really also use it for

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:55,080
application deployment and that's I

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,760
think that's a really nice feature and I

00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,250
mean this whole graph dependence that

00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,050
discovering the dependencies it has been

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,260
really a big asset for us for example

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:07,380
you have a value which is coming up from

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:09,420
from from a kubernetes endpoint and then

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:13,950
you can insert it into for one of your

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:18,780
one of your CF applications and this an

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:21,330
endpoint so back to the demo you can see

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:25,920
that now the memory has been increased

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:29,610
to one gig and then you can see that is

00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,650
indeed no one gig and then you can see

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,500
that okay I am finished with the demo

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,990
let's take her down the demo landscape

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:42,780
and you can use just basically terraform

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:44,910
destroy and it will now destroy the

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:48,660
application the route and hand the

00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:53,790
service instance so basically this was

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:56,220
my my demo on terraform cloud from the

00:19:53,790 --> 00:20:04,890
provider and if you have any questions I

00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:07,890
am very happy to take them if you have

00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,960
questions unmute yourself and do we have

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:13,290
questions on the slick I don't see any

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,620
question on the slick I have one

00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:23,280
question did you guys think of

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:28,850
submitting this for incubation I guess

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:32,460
to add it under the boundary incubator

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:35,760
to my to my knowledge that we have

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,980
submitted this for so for her she coop

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,430
to become an official provider but I see

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,110
that Guillaume is in the core so maybe

00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:46,620
he can give more insight on this

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,280
question yes it makes more sense for the

00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,920
different providers to

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,450
to be managed by ochakov because it gets

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,550
then included into the official

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:59,530
documentation NCI so that's why we

00:20:54,550 --> 00:21:01,330
haven't considered recently playing for

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,220
incubator into club sundry and then get

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,740
into the fruity cycle but we're pretty

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,750
happy to to get feedback and obviously

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:11,610
contribution from the Platonic community

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:21,220
I agree I think it makes sense

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:24,550
are you making progress yes we we want

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,530
to remain with 0.10 versioning for now

00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:30,280
because we are still lacking feedback

00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:33,670
and adoptions to to switch to a wand

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,920
over shining and ensure there will be no

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,630
compatibility though in aquatic

00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,690
compatibility change but just were

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,620
progressing the safe sim it was great to

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,430
get feedback from the community

00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,130
including

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,780
resource bundling and meaning so we are

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:52,240
taking improvements and incrementing

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:54,370
them from there okay all right maybe

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,760
another point I can mention we're still

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,710
we are based on the CCP IV tube there

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,200
would be a lot of work to migrate to

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,710
these free in the future that would be

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,900
great to be able to share this work of

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:10,170
migration from v2 to v3 with the rest of

00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:14,020
the community including the sea lighting

00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:17,290
which is acting as a as a CCP idea free

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:21,760
client we hope that the v3 migration

00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:23,770
work could be a way to to extract a go

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,240
line client that the tour phone provider

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:30,940
and other project could could rely on

00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,680
and let's see how horses will progress

00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,580
with the sea lighting that we have been

00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:40,390
collecting and sets on it as all fathers

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:45,760
okay okay that stands for question for

00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:47,800
ya know so okay thank you very much

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,880
thank you thank you very much for your

00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,020
time oh cool so now we're going to the

00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,230
PMC

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,900
I guess regular thing that we usually do

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:01,450
which is highlights and we usually start

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,900
with Eric who's been great to add terms

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,950
of the

00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,090
so maybe you must everyone I'll be I'll

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,270
be pretty fast because I think we have

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:12,640
the CF dev discussion as well a few

00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,880
highlights release integration is

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,080
planning on cutting version seven of CF

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,060
deployment in January so we draft sent

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,820
out a proposal about that to see if Deb

00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:28,570
recently and please comment on it if you

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:30,100
have chance some other exciting pieces

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,550
of work

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:35,740
the Cappy team is at a point where they

00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,180
would really like beta feedback on their

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,410
downtime deployments this is something

00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:44,170
you have to enable in your CF deployment

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,910
via an ops file but it's live on peanuts

00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,800
right now so if you as an app developer

00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:50,050
or an operator having feedback they'd

00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,780
really appreciate that and they're also

00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:56,350
closing out an effort to add labels and

00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:59,620
annotations on a lot of the entities in

00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,280
the controller API so that should be

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,560
landing soon

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,900
as well routing has some exciting news

00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,260
that continue to hit larger and larger

00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,630
scaling markers for their adoption of

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:15,130
this do pilot and envoy as a gateway

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:20,950
proxy as the new unified ingress routing

00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:23,680
tier for the runtime and along those

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:26,440
lines container networking is closing

00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,270
out some work on dynamic egress rules as

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,130
a more dynamic replacement for app

00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,070
security groups and they're also making

00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,800
progress on doing transparent

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:40,150
client-side load balancing via envoy to

00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:42,100
other apps on the platform and yeah a

00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:44,500
few other things I know we've been going

00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,330
through the EC of Linux FS 2 2 FS 3

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,610
migration but on the windows side

00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:50,410
they're doing their own migration they

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:53,680
realize that actually doesn't make sense

00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:55,660
to version the windows stack with the

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,640
Windows version because of the api

00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,710
compatibility guarantees that Microsoft

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,810
makes about Windows and so they're just

00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,350
transitioning that to a Windows forever

00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,450
stack

00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:07,720
so that's inflating and see if

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,820
deployment as well and then one other

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,820
highlight I know the arena project has

00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,860
passed the initial set of core casts and

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,340
are now focused on knocking down other

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,700
sets

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:23,980
and to get to parity with the existing

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:25,929
after that I'm back in cool as always if

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,139
you wanna see more detail we've got the

00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:30,970
PMC notes on github so just feel free to

00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:33,759
look through those and reach out about

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:36,999
slack or email or on safe death yeah and

00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:39,639
I think you hold every two weeks meeting

00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:41,230
so I've ever attended those if you're

00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:43,120
interested in the details what's going

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:47,139
on nine points ends the arena project

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,710
just join and chat with the books that

00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:54,009
would you know running those projects

00:25:50,710 --> 00:26:00,399
any questions for Eric or you know guess

00:25:54,009 --> 00:26:03,369
one-time related stuff no yeah I know

00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:07,269
it's December and I wanna be done with

00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:09,850
this I think you should thank thanks I

00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:11,679
commend the question

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,960
not even any any question which is

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,899
interesting alright cool so we have

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:21,399
friend here and I think maybe even the

00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:25,509
rest of the bush yeah yeah well I think

00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:29,379
I'm on my own today but I'd be good

00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:33,240
enough for to make up for that so in the

00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:35,679
news our PMC McConville's

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,950
PMC Leedy announced that he would be

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:43,049
stepping down as the bush core europe

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:46,509
p.m. because he was assuming boat rolls

00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:48,970
essentially this is linked to a new job

00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:51,100
you'll have at a CP where it will still

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:55,090
think about the future of bash but other

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,950
things as well so is stepping down as

00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:00,220
the PM for the team and somebody else

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:04,169
will take over so I put the link to the

00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:09,009
specific mailing list message in the

00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:12,309
meeting notes as well we I sent out an

00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:13,899
email today with announcing our or

00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:16,990
making public our vision and strategy

00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:20,169
documents so the team has been trying to

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,999
make more explicit where we are added

00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:24,129
and the new features that will be coming

00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:26,350
and that kind of stuff so the document

00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:29,590
is public now you can comment obviously

00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:33,309
a roadmap is as good

00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:35,799
I mean it's expired as as as soon as you

00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:38,080
make it public right so we expect things

00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:40,059
to change but in a positive way in the

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,950
sense that we want a dialogue with the

00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:46,990
community and really be more open about

00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,520
where we are at it so anyway you have

00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,610
the link to the message in the notes as

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,470
well Toronto team is working now on

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,510
implementing rotation for manifest

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:59,039
defined certificates so this would be

00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:01,980
useful in a lot of contexts especially

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,260
if you have releases with lots of

00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:07,059
variables that are certificates we are

00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,520
in the planning stage to make

00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:11,620
improvements to our drain life cycle so

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,600
gathering requirements on that so if you

00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,659
have opinions please reach out to me I'm

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,480
on slack more than happy to hop on a

00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:23,710
call and hear from you if you are a

00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:26,620
release alter San Francisco team is

00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,779
making improvements to our DNS

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,330
healthiness stuff so essentially now

00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:34,210
you'll be able to target a specific job

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,980
instead of just an instance so this

00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,380
makes it more granular and you'll be

00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:41,890
able to know if specific jobs are up or

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:46,510
down which can be certainly useful and

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:49,330
then we in San Francisco as well have

00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,279
implemented security improvement where

00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,380
essentially no credentials will be

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,350
written to disk anymore

00:28:53,380 --> 00:29:00,039
so this is a really nifty if you want

00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:01,590
well we'll probably announce or publish

00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,850
more details about that in our

00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,590
documentation on budget i/o but if

00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,700
you're curious about it please reach out

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:14,980
and we see what you what we can tell you

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:21,640
at this point and that's about it so

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:24,250
what does that mean when you well we are

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,409
using Tempah fess ramdisk

00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,559
essentially to write them so that's I

00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:32,830
mean they are still there right we not

00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:35,140
have a choice at this point in time but

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:37,380
we are still well we are already

00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,880
contemplating future improvements like

00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,070
encrypting the whole thing and then

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,359
adding real-time decryption that kind of

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,330
stuff but at Lee

00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,419
this incremental improvement provides

00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:52,239
certainly reduces the potential for

00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:54,299
exploits so that's a step in the right

00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:54,299
direction

00:29:54,539 --> 00:30:02,649
all right let's see if there's any

00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:05,889
question for Fred no questions okay I

00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:09,639
don't see anything on the slack okay so

00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:12,700
I'll do a quick update I guess for the

00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:17,349
opener of his book API I know dog is

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:21,429
moving to something new at IBM but maybe

00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:23,409
I'll see if I can get the his person

00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:25,809
that's gonna back him up to join this

00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:30,759
call but Matt I don't know if he's here

00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:33,099
we haven't had an update from them okay

00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:36,309
I'll make sure that for next year we

00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:39,999
will have whoever otherwise I'll think

00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:42,460
I'll think that because I know there's

00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:46,539
the activities and angle venture is

00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:49,809
Walker so that should be good thing all

00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:51,820
right cool so for extensions quickly

00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:53,320
I put a note I put a link for the notes

00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:57,609
obviously we're gonna have an update of

00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,989
sea of death right after this so we can

00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:01,029
hear about what's going on I've been

00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:02,919
trying to sort of promote this project

00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:05,649
because I think it's great and I think

00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,469
that as a team or doing you know really

00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:11,229
cool stuff like chip was mentioning

00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:13,570
about the bill practical i/o work that

00:31:11,229 --> 00:31:16,809
they're doing so this is kind of like

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:19,269
this entire team within the buy a

00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:22,119
meeting and they're gonna give us an

00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:24,879
update but there's also a cool a couple

00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:28,989
more projects worth mentioning some

00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:31,659
highlights so first straddles be 2.2 I

00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:34,450
think that's the one that has the the

00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:36,489
extension mechanism so if you want to

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,349
extend the UI you can actually do that

00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:39,609
so you cannot go in pads and stuff like

00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:42,070
that I think they were trying to figure

00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:44,769
out you know people that wanted to sort

00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:48,489
of leave to try this if you interested

00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,940
and then also the team from s AP multi

00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,129
axe

00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,719
they added better support for the USB

00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:56,109
API as well as

00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:56,830
you know ways to deal with products and

00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:59,680
services

00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:03,130
they've asked me to to do it demo

00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:05,140
updates I didn't get a chance to sync up

00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,630
with them for this call especially since

00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,690
we already have two presentations but

00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,970
very likely this will happen next year

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:18,010
so so you'll get an update on this and

00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:22,100
then also bill packs move their new TS

00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:23,610
support so that's that to call for

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,690
[Music]

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:29,080
extensions it's not gonna happen this

00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:32,260
year because you would have it would

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:35,590
have been on Monday which is the 24th of

00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,630
December which is against a before

00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:43,030
Christmas or Christian so it's kind of a

00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:47,260
a bad day so we'll figure out next year

00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:49,650
and get an updates on this okay so with

00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,600
that let's see if there any questions

00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:56,830
just generally otherwise we're gonna

00:32:52,600 --> 00:33:00,220
pass it - I think it's Sam

00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:04,300
Dawson oh cool who is gonna give us a

00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:06,179
quick update on yep there it is not the

00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:09,510
mailing this it's actually a project

00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:12,640
this is going to be recorded hopefully

00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:14,620
you know time will give us enough the

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,950
better explanation of what see up there

00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,600
is

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,090
I'm very excited about this tool so

00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,480
that's why I also wanna you know I'm

00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:25,179
excited to see it happen so Sam you you

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,320
might have to share your screen yep yep

00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:32,200
happy to share my screen can everyone

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,580
hear me yes okay yes as dr. max

00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,130
mentioned my name is Sam I'm with

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:40,480
pivotal in New York so I'm just joining

00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:42,820
the CF dev team this week with Scott

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,750
Scott is has been bringing me up to

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,490
speed

00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:48,400
he's out sick today but I did want to

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:50,770
just give a quick update to everyone

00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,870
about what we've been doing and a quick

00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:56,590
introduction for those who are not yet

00:33:52,870 --> 00:34:09,540
familiar with CF dev so I will share my

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:09,540
screen now okay

00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:18,500
sure so we see the title slide here yes

00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:20,480
okay yeah so please reach out to me on

00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,970
slack with any questions or any follow

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,839
up for those who are not yet familiar

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:28,369
with CF dev cff is a project that we've

00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:32,899
been working on it's sort of like

00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:35,389
running CF in miniature on a local

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:37,429
machine or on a single machine so we've

00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:42,710
been working on a way to spin up see if

00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:47,690
the using the native hypervisors on the

00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:51,889
computer as a way to start CTF dev and

00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:54,530
build and and run some applications so

00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:57,410
some of the common use cases that we've

00:34:54,530 --> 00:35:02,030
been thinking about are debugging

00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:06,559
locally or spinning up a CF instance to

00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:09,289
sort of kick the tires or as a way to

00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:11,059
begin application development in a CF

00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:14,000
environment if the rest of the network

00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:17,270
is locked down so some of the things

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,180
that are new I imagine since this group

00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:22,910
last heard about CF dev that we've been

00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:26,779
working on so the ability to start using

00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:32,029
the state disk starting with a smaller

00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:35,510
amount of RAM and reducing the time to

00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:39,079
to start CF we've also added some

00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:42,170
telemetry to observe usage and provided

00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,329
a memory warning to the user at start if

00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:50,299
their machine is not it does not have

00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:52,420
sufficient memory to to start CF so I've

00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:54,529
been playing around doing some

00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,140
acceptance on these different stories

00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:59,270
trying to increase our performance and

00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:02,029
get our memory footprint down these

00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:05,420
times aren't exact but here's roughly

00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:08,809
what we're seeing should be a little

00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:12,559
gift here that shows the startup

00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:16,099
sequence in in terminal so using the CF

00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:18,049
dev start command you know just running

00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:21,170
through the cycle there and showing that

00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:22,260
we have been able to start in about 20

00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:26,490
min

00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:28,680
and also have been able to start CAF de

00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,600
of using a smaller memory footprint of

00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,460
of five gigabytes has been the smallest

00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,680
that I've been able to do it but we're

00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,650
continuing to test this on different

00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,910
machines to see how small we can make

00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:44,220
that footprint and how quickly we can

00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:46,410
get CF dev up and running locally some

00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:50,490
things that we are thinking about next

00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:53,280
are supporting Linux the ability to

00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:55,470
deploy or under ploy services lunch once

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,610
CF dev is running so right now we could

00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:03,600
either start with my sequel or without

00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:05,310
we couldn't though deploy or unda ploy

00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,270
that service once we're up and running

00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,940
so that's a thing that we're thinking

00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:12,120
about doing as well as binding local

00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:18,900
volume services to apps that are started

00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:20,760
so today you can get the CLI plugin CF

00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:25,170
dev start spinning up on your computer

00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:28,500
you could then start a my sequel service

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:32,250
you could push an app and you could bind

00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:34,980
the my sequel service to that app and

00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:38,390
then thinking about these as the next

00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,470
things that are coming up all along the

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,240
mindset of trying to reduce that

00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,690
footprint and startup time so to make it

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:50,160
people easier for people to spin up a

00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:54,240
local instance of of CF so that's all I

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:58,020
got for for an update happy to fueled

00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,300
any questions and also gather any

00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,650
feedback from this group as I mentioned

00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,150
this is my first week so I'm sort of

00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,950
coming up to speed in this space so I'm

00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,230
would be interested to hear from anyone

00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:10,950
who has UCF dev or is interested in

00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:14,070
using so you have to have or any of the

00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:17,280
use cases in mind cool they put you in

00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:19,410
the hot seat they did yeah that's

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,940
alright I've had I've had a couple days

00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,560
to play around with it and start it up

00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,660
on a few different machines and

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,760
familiarize myself with the product

00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,580
roadmap and all that so happy to be

00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,430
putting out see so when you say five

00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,170
game it means that it actually will

00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,320
reserve that entire five

00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,480
on the machine right so it's my machine

00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,900
has 8 gig then I have 3 gig left for

00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,150
anything else right exactly yes yeah

00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,890
okay I guess this it's not too much of

00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:52,590
an issue this day since most things have

00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:57,320
16 gig or more but yep obviously yeah in

00:38:52,590 --> 00:39:02,610
and this this is Mac Windows and Linux

00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:09,360
currently Mac in Windows Linux is on our

00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:11,100
roadmap yep I have another question but

00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:16,800
let's see if there is anybody else I

00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:19,280
have a question ok I don't see anything

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,190
on the on the stack or there notes

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,170
quickly so you mentioned that the use

00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,870
case obviously is is to get started with

00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:30,780
CF very quickly in 30 minutes I could

00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:33,570
show under 30 minutes I guess yeah be

00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:38,580
disconnected do you see any other use

00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:41,250
case for this just to kind of like give

00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,870
people ideas on how they should they

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,540
should be excited about this and get

00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:48,720
started with this we've also heard of

00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:52,260
some application developers wanting or

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:57,750
using CF dev for debugging an

00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:59,460
application if they're having issue or

00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:02,280
you know being being locked out of other

00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:05,040
parts of the network for the CF actual

00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,940
foundation within an enterprise so

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,240
that's one of the use cases that I'm

00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,370
interested in exploring and then the

00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,110
primary one was what you mentioned I

00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:15,150
think though as I take over this product

00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,200
roadmap one of the things that I'm

00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,210
really interested in doing is

00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,130
understanding how people are using it

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,450
what they're using it for that's a big

00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,000
reason why we've put in some of the

00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:25,620
telemetry to under see what the usage is

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,660
but also reaching out to the community

00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,640
engaging with people to see how it's

00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,080
being used and how people want to use it

00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:37,620
and then trying to support those use

00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:41,880
cases maybe one feedback yeah in terms

00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:43,620
of our use cases the tooling offers that

00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,010
develop tools and needs to integrate

00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:49,100
with Cloud Foundry and and

00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:51,500
automatic test some of them including

00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,480
the telephone project that was denied

00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,250
before by Janice have a hard time

00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,920
maintaining their pipeline to get them

00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,960
up and running and updated Krypton or

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,800
instance and would like to benefit to

00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,600
benefit from from safe death yeah that'd

00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,780
be awesome to be able to run those tests

00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,990
in and circles here I own in Travis

00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:15,740
without maintaining a full fledge trade

00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:19,040
foundry pipeline on one of the IES for

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,420
running those automated tests yeah but

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,220
that's great that makes a lot of sense

00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:26,960
thank you so just just to be clear for

00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,270
people you basically are running your

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,850
entire Cloud Foundry so basically and

00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,500
let's say you have an environment that's

00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:36,260
using the latest version would see up

00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:39,050
there on your laptop you can run pretty

00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,030
much the same bits this is why this is

00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:45,470
powerful right and you get it running in

00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:46,940
under 30 minutes yep yep and we're we're

00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,350
trying to keep that footprint and

00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,020
startup time small to make it easy to

00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:53,740
get up and going but be able to do yeah

00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,950
what you just mentioned dr. max cool

00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,930
excellent

00:41:54,950 --> 00:42:00,170
so I guess it's it's really the end of

00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:02,300
the year thank you everybody this is

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,750
pretty much a wrap because I don't see

00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:10,340
any questions so unless I see an

00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:13,760
interruption this is it for 2018 and

00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:17,810
we'll see you in January

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:20,690
have a great holiday relax

00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:22,010
take care of yourself in your family and

00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,680
we'll see you next year

00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:27,130
take care everybody great thank you guys

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,130
