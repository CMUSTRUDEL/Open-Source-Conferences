let me know Oh we'll record it excellent

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,530
okay so this is a cat call for February

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:19,130
we have a nice agenda and as usual we

00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,990
start with the foundation I think's

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,780
Warner is here to give us an update on

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,850
CF summit and all the good stuff going

00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:31,010
on there

00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,629
yep so the usual updates are already in

00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,920
the agenda documents so I'm not gonna go

00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:36,320
over that the only thing I wanted to

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,810
point out is the contributor summit that

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,149
we are starting it brand new this time

00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,550
in Philadelphia it will be a day zero

00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:46,210
activity from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. so we're

00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,450
just doing a few hours on day 0 it's

00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:52,130
open for all contributors new old

00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,780
veterans whatever if you have

00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,610
contributed any at any point of time

00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,890
even if you don't contribute any more

00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,750
you're more than welcome the agenda is

00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,239
still being finalized for that specific

00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,509
three-hour slot I will share that on the

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,720
skid on the online agenda or the

00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:11,450
registration list once we get there but

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,000
if you are a contributor please do

00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:18,049
register for that for the contributors

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,320
some I don't do 0 yeah so why don't I

00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,720
discuss this a little bit and it's you

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,250
know it's gonna be kind of what I guess

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,470
contributors want to make out of it in

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,439
terms of you know what you want to

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,570
discuss and answer needs the first time

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,380
I think we're doing this right so yeah

00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,180
interesting to to find out like what are

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,740
the impediments for you to contribute or

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,939
you're happy and things like that yeah

00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,950
it will be an open and a discussion

00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,750
across the rooms so some of the topics

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,320
that at least I got as suggestions from

00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,400
the community are doing a retro as to

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,780
what are the things that have gone well

00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,520
so far what are the things that could go

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,930
better that we could have done better

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,400
and all those kind of discussions so

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,409
bring all your thoughts and all your

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,420
suggestions and feedback I will have a

00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:04,970
white board set up as well in the room

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,269
in case you'll want to kind of draw any

00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:12,889
components or the any kind of

00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:15,139
whiteboarding kind of discussion so as I

00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:17,710
said the agenda is definitely driven by

00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:19,720
the community it I'm I got

00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,690
some suggestions from the community for

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,330
this particular one based on how it goes

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,960
this year we will we will reevaluate as

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,670
in should we have it as a longer session

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,410
should we have it as an entire day set

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,640
in day long session on day zero or

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,950
should we make it as a great kind of

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,870
activity so based on the feedback that

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,150
we get this year we will definitely

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,910
change it and make it even better in the

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,970
subsequent segments yeah I think you may

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,910
have said as the business there is it at

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,700
the beginning of the day or at the

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,110
second it is from 12 to 3 so it is

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,080
second half of the day right before the

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,440
keynotes begin you have time to arrive

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,270
even if you come on the first day in

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,940
exactly yeah we wanted to give people it

00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,100
mainly because we are little over only a

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,550
little over a month from some it's a

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,720
even if people are trying to make

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,580
finalized the travel plans now we wanted

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,490
to give them enough time to arrive on

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,060
that day and settle in and then head

00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:21,070
over to contribute summer cool excellent

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,470
so everybody should be registered

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,820
because price increase on 23rd but

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:30,640
everybody here probably contributors so

00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:35,910
ok any questions for SWANA or CF summit

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:38,640
or anything related to foundation nope

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:42,160
alright so we have Eric here as usual

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,890
thanks dr. max wait sure I'll give a few

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:49,870
highlights from the runtime PMC over the

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:52,510
past month or so I believe since we last

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,690
met the integration team is published

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,250
version 7 of CF deployment so this is

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:01,360
continuing to move everyone forward

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:04,000
towards CF Linux FS 3 as the main build

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,940
Packer defense of the default it's also

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,130
moving deployments over to the exe my

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,030
sequel release internally if you're

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:15,630
using that as your health Henry

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,459
application runtime database

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,850
sounds like Cathy is making a lot of

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,550
good progress on rolling deployments in

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,730
particular they're nailing down one of

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,710
the details and work to support explicit

00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:33,260
revisions of applications so you can

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,260
roll forwards and backwards for those

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,270
when you're doing those rolling

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,770
deployments and apps they've also been

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:46,260
working a lot with the CLI team as part

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,180
of the view 3d acceleration team and so

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,300
they've recently posted on so you have

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,320
to have with some plans around

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,610
completing the v3 controller API and

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,520
transitioning everything to that over

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,560
some period of time so I'm expected that

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,550
affects a lot of us on this call and I'm

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,550
sure they would appreciate feedback

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,860
likewise the lager Gator team is kind of

00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,229
deprecated their older components and

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,699
api's that they support and there's

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,979
already been some discussion on CF dev

00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,270
about deprecating the fire hose end

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,710
point in particular because through a

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,169
lot of integrations built against that

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,889
so they're certainly continuing to see

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:28,050
feedback on that deprecation where them

00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:30,750
encourage people to contact those teams

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:34,650
directly either on CF dev or on slack or

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,469
via email a few other highlights the

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,969
routing and container networking teams

00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,740
have been discussing ways to reorganize

00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:43,020
and they've merged into a single

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,599
networking team that's supporting both

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,210
existing GA components like the co

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,569
routers and container networking via

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,419
silk but are also working on integrating

00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:55,889
components of this Bo into Cloud Foundry

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:59,099
to support the next generation of the

00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:00,270
rabbit ear so effectively the same work

00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,889
they've been doing about trying to get

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,029
more aligned in terms of their team

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:09,120
structure and angles so they can operate

00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:11,460
more efficiently one exciting cupcake

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,190
from the window side is that the garden

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:18,750
windows team is now integrating Windows

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:23,550
Server 2019 so they should have a new

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:25,110
wave of updates to work well against

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,150
that I think this probably going to be a

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,650
new window is continue rue de festival

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,339
Ong with that because that tends to be

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:36,389
highly coupled to the OS version that's

00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:38,939
running on the windows Diego cells and

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,830
then also on the ireenie team since you

00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:42,599
making a lot of good progress they've

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,210
been focused a lot on hardening so

00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:46,949
making sure that ireenie can run and a

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,460
redundant hell available configuration

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:52,409
to reduce downtime during updates or

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,650
unexpected failures sounds like they're

00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:57,949
working on enforcing all the container

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,300
limits that we expect for CF workloads

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,819
and then some other work to make it

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,460
easier to opt into native staging the

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,360
ireenie instead of delegating some of

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,360
that work to diego buddy

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,260
exact thank you Eric any questions

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,350
Jules you want to add anything I mean I

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,100
think every culture did but I don't know

00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:27,660
if you seem like a pretty good summary

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,850
apart from the bit about needing to deal

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,800
with updates we won't need any updates

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,520
because the first version we share will

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,110
be imperfect apart from that it was a

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,440
pretty good summary

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,560
that's how software works did you record

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,560
that

00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,270
Irie Irie track I retract that now I see

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:53,160
a home I'll extract that and usually

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:55,440
other projects later all right thank you

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,550
Eric appreciate it

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:04,220
I don't see Fred but maybe he is signed

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,220
up on different name oh boy

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,770
okay so let's keep watch for a minute

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,720
and go to extension and hopefully he'll

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:15,040
join he usually joins and give us an

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:21,340
update on the way so for extensions I

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:24,190
think I added a few highlights from the

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,530
last meeting we had in January and I

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,990
think the Apple is killer for instance

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:31,570
they're trying to scale to their testing

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,610
I guess scaling to 20,000 acts they are

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,180
integrating with straddles not

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:43,659
stratosphere I'll fix that

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:47,980
all right weather and we have a new COI

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:50,290
plugin bill packs similar to what Eric

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,120
was saying about that CF Linux Tepes

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,070
three that's one of the chance they're

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,220
making and there's two new go packs

00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:00,010
against one for our you know nginx

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,420
so maybe you want to check it out and

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,500
then there's also a lot of work going on

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,940
to support the bill packs that IO

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,030
initiative so that's definitely

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,550
something to look into I actually had

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,080
planning to chat with them today so

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:19,120
hopefully next time we'll have a better

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,190
update the back use there's various

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,290
refactoring bug fixes I think one thing

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,850
about abacus to mention is that the SAE

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:30,070
team wants to I guess go in-house with a

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,580
version so version two that we have

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,350
planned probably won't happen but this

00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,450
current version will just stay and then

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,060
you know go into some kind of an inner

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:42,940
life so if you're interested in the

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:47,760
backups and interested in you know this

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:52,180
direction then definitely ping me or

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,950
Easter Seals oh sorry and we can we can

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,880
update on that more detail or join the

00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:02,260
the extension scholar that that should

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:04,360
be discussed there and Stratos probably

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,360
like the highlights of all of extensions

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,589
it's going on very well this new feature

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,760
is being added all the time

00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:15,670
they had a CVE so if you didn't see this

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,360
and you're using it definitely

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,910
ping me or being

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,220
[Music]

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:26,410
the team they have a Stratis channel so

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:31,210
you may want to go there and learn about

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:33,010
that but version 2.3 dot zero is really

00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,530
stuck you go to their website to the

00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,390
github you can see the different really

00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:41,080
two months I don't know if they included

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:44,200
the details of the CV but journey you

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,170
know now that is out you could discuss

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,800
with the audience multi apps we had an

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,840
update in January from the SSAT team and

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,560
I think one cool thing there to mention

00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,360
is the M

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,030
it's the assemble tool that they added

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,620
so you can assemble you know your

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,190
multiple apps from different things

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:08,440
including the free image so that's cool

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:10,510
and then blockhead I think this this

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,150
team one of the key thing they did they

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:15,870
added support for the i-pro later fabric

00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:19,300
so now you can use the blockade to

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,690
deeper into the hyper later and actually

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,360
saw a demo of this by swetha a member of

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:30,300
the team and I didn't think and it was

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:33,190
pretty cool so who that service you can

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:37,000
deploy another me when I put a drip but

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,620
also I guess on ethereum Lima is always

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,370
on the calls he's actually on this call

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,530
so I kept questions think you know ask

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,100
them like this so let me stop here and

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:50,860
see if there are any questions for

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,260
extensions so comments we have a few of

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,430
the leaders there so if you wanna ask

00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,090
question about their projects

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,090
I'm sure do

00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:06,950
No okay people want to hear about bottle

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,899
I guess get to the docks

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:14,149
okay rush well let's see if we can have

00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:16,750
it because I don't see Fred so anybody

00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,750
from Bosch

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:23,520
like okay I'll think what to do to

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,520
paying them and find out what's going on

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:31,820
because fred has been very very good at

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:35,820
coming pretty much the pass every single

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:39,779
you know cap call so maybe something

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,459
going on he's in Montreal they you know

00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,480
how to deal with the cold so I'm sure

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,310
it's not about that

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,399
there must be some other reason maybe

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,910
he's on vacation okay so we'll get to

00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,709
the talks then let me share my screen

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:57,870
because I'll be the one presenting first

00:12:52,709 --> 00:13:07,220
my presentation should be short so I'm

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:12,750
gonna do we think so I sent out a survey

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:17,610
which that close I guest recently about

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:19,830
a week ago it followed pretty much what

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:23,070
we did last year

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:25,470
and what you're gonna see now are the

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,940
results so hopefully you guys can see my

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,250
screen if you can't see my screen yell

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:34,040
out

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:35,330
all right so it's it's just a short

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,110
presentation on the results

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:41,780
so obviously the goal is to do a retro

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:45,950
right I mean we can't really do retro

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:49,700
for cat calls every month since the call

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:53,030
is every month and you know it will be I

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,520
guess you know it makes sense to wait

00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:58,760
for a few and yearly seems about right

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,350
we did it last time and it worked out so

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,690
the goal is of course to collect it back

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,220
and then see what we can do to to

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,320
improve

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,200
I think after last year we improved it

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,060
to a point where I could see some of the

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,900
changes and then hopefully we can keep

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:17,270
improving so the questions if you took

00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:21,620
the survey is very simple it's only

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:24,500
three questions first how often have you

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,680
attended or do you attend pretty much so

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,260
I can get an idea of whether or not you

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,170
know you're an outsider or you're part

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:37,070
of the team that attend usually what you

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:39,680
enjoyed the most and then constructive

00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,660
feedback so keep it simple if you have

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,670
comments on the questions in terms of

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,920
should I ask different questions for

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,480
next year then definitely ping but I

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:53,030
think this kind of keeps it small and

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:58,210
short so we had 24 responses when I had

00:14:53,030 --> 00:15:00,410
stopped it you know last one day

00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,690
compared to last year it's about the

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,430
same I don't know if it's the same

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,700
people that actually responded so it's

00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:11,390
not clear but it was about 25 last year

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:15,410
so I guess and we have about 25 people

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:19,610
trying maybe it's just us which is I

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:23,330
guess good to some extent so this is the

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:27,560
spread I guess the question number one

00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:29,750
you can see that it's kind of almost

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,150
evenly distributed although a fair

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:37,850
number of people that you know never

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:40,490
attended so you know we I guess a goal

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,070
this would be to try to convert those

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:47,960
eight people that did not

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:50,500
to attend all right so I think they were

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,680
there was one response in terms of the

00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:57,110
constructive feedback that explains why

00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,080
people can attend which is you have a I

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,990
mean I'll spare you I'll tell you right

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,530
now is that people complain that the ATM

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:10,040
time is very early obviously you know if

00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,660
you're on the west coast it's kind of

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,750
the hour where you're trying to get to

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,720
work if you're anywhere else around the

00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:20,600
world that's kind of okay although if

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,060
you're in China that's probably you know

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:32,150
end of your day if you're in Australia

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:35,120
well we can really yeah we cannot please

00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:38,390
everybody but we only have one good

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:46,010
person there well maybe more yeah we

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:52,100
don't know anybody there this is kind of

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:56,410
a the the words list that came out my

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:59,930
name came come up there so I think my

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:03,920
payment to a couple people were one

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:06,260
point but otherwise I think people super

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,570
happy about the demos and of course the

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,280
project updates which is not surprising

00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:14,540
because I was one of the things that we

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:18,470
fixed to make that better so this is the

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:21,320
tag cloud for all the words so the way I

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,620
generated those and also the word list

00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,110
is to take all the comments because in

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,980
each question we allow people to put you

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:34,340
know two three four in comments and I

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:37,400
convert them to to lowercase and then I

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:40,730
run to this tool that removes you know

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,640
basic you know propositions and stuff

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:46,880
like that and then generates a tag cloud

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:51,220
and you can see clearly that demos are

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,820
the key so we'll try to keep doing up

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,620
and then

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,760
last question question number two I

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,610
guess I'm sorry question number two

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,270
highlight so I took some of the

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,960
responses that I thought were

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,190
interesting

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,650
so getting demos presence of the

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:14,210
complete foundation that was only one

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:17,800
time shown but definitely it's it's good

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:21,170
to see that people care about that right

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,690
and then that's mean you're actually I

00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,540
didn't write this but somebody did I

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,850
appreciate it but definitely demo is

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,140
inside this report of course and then

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,870
somebody says I don't even know where

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:38,080
the cap ball is so clearly we have some

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:42,800
work to do okay so question three is

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,680
constructive feedback the words that

00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,180
come out come up don't make a lot of

00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,040
sense but I think it makes a little bit

00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:55,880
more sense when you see the selected

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:57,590
responses I think you know the fact I

00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,300
guess in some ways they're happy the

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,150
fact that we keep having it right and

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,100
we're pretty consistent having it that's

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:08,660
what I'm guessing the the meaning of

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:11,120
that I think one of the big thing that

00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,000
came out that probably a good action

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,190
item doesn't show very highly because

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,940
only one person mentioned it is to break

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,860
the YouTube videos into smaller sub

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,510
videos so that way like somebody wants

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,870
to see Constantine talk they don't have

00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,310
to go to me and the highlight so if you

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,320
want to always see the highlights then

00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,970
break out the highlights so I thought

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,830
that was a that was a better that was a

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:37,190
very good one I thought the highlight of

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:39,650
this was you speaking now well I know

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,830
but I don't think that's fair I don't

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:46,970
I'm sure that's not right somebody's

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:48,920
just being very nice to me and yeah

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,270
exactly my payments are working but it's

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,300
that that's not what it is

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:55,100
I definitely think the the breaking the

00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,100
YouTube video would help because like if

00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,840
you watch YouTube and and you watch a

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,710
multi segment show it's great to have

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,260
like for instance I watch you know

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,880
Stephen Colbert every day and

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,680
I watch it on YouTube because I watched

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,450
the little segments I don't have to

00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,030
watch the whole show right so so I think

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,040
that's a definitely a very good one but

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,890
we'll have to work out how to do this

00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,870
since stuck in Windows a lot of the work

00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:24,430
and you know we're not trying to add

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:28,630
more work to actually units let's see

00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:30,430
some of the highlights of this so more

00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:33,040
company representation so that's not

00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:35,580
showing and the tag cloud because it was

00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,470
mentioned once but I extracted it and

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:41,860
and that's probably a fair point because

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:44,920
it seems like we have lots of talk from

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:47,170
sa PE stocking away and used to do a lot

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,630
of talk with you you know the author

00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,430
need well-represented and then of course

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,700
the key members of the foundation a

00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:57,640
little idea and so on but we probably

00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,620
should try to reach out to smaller

00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,480
companies and see if they have talks

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:06,100
right so let's I think that to you keep

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,750
up the good work so I'm happy people are

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,690
happy about this that came up at least

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:15,190
two or three times so that's good and

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:16,720
then a TMS effect yes I just don't know

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,020
what else to do is somebody suggested

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,540
8:30 the problem with 8:30 is that if it

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:25,800
would finish at 9:30 then that means

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:29,980
that it eats into people like Eric who

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:32,470
you know for a pivotal here have to go

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:37,860
to a stand-up right so that's a bit

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:40,290
challenging and then nothing

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,049
which is also nice right so people don't

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:46,200
want any change okay and then the last

00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:52,350
thing is I guess I had one more keep it

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:56,400
up and then I put some of the text as is

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:59,240
except converted to lowercase into the

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:04,080
presentation so if you want to see that

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,640
click the link in the agenda and then

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,320
you'll get access to that presentation

00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:12,660
and see it if you want to see the 2017

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,030
let me know or if you go back and time

00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:18,450
in the cab agenda then you should see a

00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:20,130
link to it that's all I have let's see

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,770
if we have any questions maybe if you

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,179
have like feedback that you couldn't

00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,669
give at the time or you didn't take the

00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:29,280
survey maybe you can give it now it's

00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:31,980
all fair I mean you know we want to make

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,650
this time the most productive time that

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,460
we can for the Cloud Foundry foundation

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:44,240
and you know we're always happy for your

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:44,240
feedback so any comments anything

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:54,120
okay so I guess people are happy let me

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:57,149
stop sharing and ask consent them to

00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,490
take over so that way you can be ready

00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:03,770
to show us in the meantime if you have a

00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,770
question feel free to tell us

00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,080
you know I guess people happy will keep

00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,250
doing it them

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,529
can't complain I'm you know I'm happy to

00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:18,029
come here take the train at 6:00 a.m.

00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:19,529
and and V here so it's once a month I

00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:23,149
can do that all right

00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:23,149
cuts it then it's all yours

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:31,320
all right so we'll stop doing that that

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,320
was really loud

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:38,500
hi I'm Konstantin and yeah I was asked

00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:42,400
to introduce or present the stuff we did

00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,740
around silk it's a prototype but I mean

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,260
we thought it might be a cool thing to

00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:51,040
have in the future so this is what we

00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:55,540
did and why we did it so the problem is

00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,640
CF uses Stoke for CNI kubernetes has a

00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,470
lot of choices but none of them run on

00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,620
Cloud Foundry so there's no common

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,780
ground whatsoever and it would be really

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,240
nice to have microservices with UDP

00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,940
maybe because I've seen customers do

00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,070
that and maybe even microservices with

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,570
exotic protocols but then again you have

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,930
to solve how you were going to expose

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:20,080
that one solution could be a natural tur

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,910
that does the bridging to the silk over

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,500
the network itself and then just routes

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:29,320
2d parts directly but I'm not going to

00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:34,420
go too deep into that area

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,790
so essentially silk is a CNI after the

00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,500
container networking interface

00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:41,230
specification and there wasn't really

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,820
that much work to be done to make it run

00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,090
on kubernetes we didn't really actually

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:49,780
we didn't really change the actual code

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:52,480
we both rappers to prototype faster and

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:56,410
not have to compile all the time and at

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,320
some point it started working so you

00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:02,560
could actually just use ireenie but that

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,960
would completely leave out cute clusters

00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:11,620
that are standalone maybe deployed by a

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:14,710
GCP or other mechanisms also I have no

00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:17,650
idea whether irony which is Benitez or

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:21,250
Unitas workers as a scheduler will

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:23,320
actually support helm and I want to jump

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,270
in here just for what it's worth we have

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,840
a story in our backlog that says look at

00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:31,630
stocking Wayne's awesome article and

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,280
links to your article what it's worth

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,200
that's there they're really point of

00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,800
view is we might well steal some of your

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:42,070
work

00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:44,140
cool offer the public yeah so I didn't

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,030
really know how much time I have so the

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,190
slides are really just scratching the

00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,260
surface I wanted to just have to take

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:54,190
them all at the end so people will

00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,230
actually see it working well it kind of

00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:00,190
just works but it kind of just works I

00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:03,580
mean we had to deliver a purr around an

00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:07,000
offender because cube communities looks

00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:10,059
for an interface that has scope global

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,890
while still creates in interface that is

00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:13,780
scope linked which makes sense if you

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,910
look at the networking architecture I

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:20,950
mean soap by itself just builds bridges

00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:22,360
from the container hosts and then routes

00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,580
that traffic and somewhere in between

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,770
there's a policy API that creates IP

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:33,220
table rules to allow or block traffic

00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:35,320
but having that run on a group worker

00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:39,780
just worked out of the box so we just

00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:43,450
co-located so policy API exelon agent

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:46,420
and the daemon and then again that

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,640
already created our bridge and the only

00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,679
thing to solve from that point on was to

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,140
figure out how to actually mount one of

00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,600
those silk interfaces into a cube

00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:59,679
container the nice thing about this

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:03,040
would be so first of all we can still

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,679
use helm we have a pretty much vanilla

00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,710
kubernetes running there the only change

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:12,640
we had to make was to add a configurable

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:15,190
CNI path so we have a custom CFC are

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,750
released running under the hood but the

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,300
only thing we did there was pretty much

00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,450
make the CNI path and the path to the

00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:26,290
config and the binder is configurable

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:28,020
and the easy wins there are isolation

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:31,300
but also interconnectivity between

00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,700
different cube clusters as well as cloud

00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,770
foundries I mean if you take that thing

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,700
to another level you could once you

00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:42,160
figure it out to foundations having two

00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,919
foundations using the same silk agent

00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,870
you could just link containers in

00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:48,700
between them once you externalize the

00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,630
actual routing API from the Cloud

00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,450
Foundry deployment

00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,730
and the other really nice thing is that

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,830
it does not have any dependencies on

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,750
your infrastructure layer so no and this

00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,660
xt required no load balancer it's a

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:04,990
service required whatsoever and you also

00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:07,059
gets the CF policy system for free that

00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:10,990
also just works we'll see that in a few

00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:14,080
minutes so I added the links to what we

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:16,240
did here again so there's two blog posts

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,299
currently I'm writing up a third one

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,990
that actually explains in depth what we

00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:25,659
had to do with the IP tables and how to

00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,730
deploy that thing once that's done I'm

00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:30,909
gonna probably post it and all says like

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:33,490
if people want to rebuild that currently

00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:35,860
there most of the cia's in here I

00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,350
updated it a bit to work with the latest

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:40,000
CF deployment I had to redeploy

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,890
everything because that required both

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,159
DNS which we didn't have to have back

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:48,100
then anyway let's just switch to the

00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:53,289
detect demo so on the Left I have

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:56,320
targeted ICF I pushed the event just to

00:28:53,289 --> 00:29:01,150
have something running in there and here

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,580
I do have a nikkie CFC our cluster

00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:06,610
target I didn't really deploy any

00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:10,110
specific workloads I'm just gonna use

00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:14,260
whatever is there in cube system

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:17,200
and the first thing we'll see those IP

00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:20,980
addresses are from the silk right so we

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,039
got allocated a 24 range for its worker

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,620
node and it's running a few parts I mean

00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:28,600
I can just delete that part that will

00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:41,440
start up with a fresh try pinochle just

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:43,059
to show that it's working system and in

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:54,940
the meantime I'm going to see if ssh

00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:58,980
into CFM here there we go it's got a

00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,980
different IP it's actually running

00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:14,460
not crashing or something and yeah so I

00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,769
probably I don't know whether enabled

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:20,010
access yesterday evening or not I'm just

00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:21,840
going to disable it for the moment what

00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:25,799
this group does is pretty much just see

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:30,210
if curl the policy API the policy API

00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:33,659
uses an app ID as the policy ID so what

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,519
we did for pods we just looked up the

00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,850
parent of that part which could be a

00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:42,269
deployment replica set or whatever and

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:46,200
use the UID of the parent of the pod for

00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:50,730
the policy so what we do to enable or

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:53,190
disable axis is and that could be easily

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:57,889
done by CF CLI it's just hitting CF and

00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:57,889
points anyway so you need the namespace

00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:09,899
system and then you just say whichever

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:13,320
pod and ng app so that's now gonna

00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:14,820
delete the policy I don't know whether

00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,779
it was already there

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:28,559
so I'm just gonna hit up cube TNS and do

00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:36,230
a lookup oops that's the wrong pain it

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:38,820
should not work yep you want to come out

00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:41,340
so I'm just gonna rerun that same

00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,730
command with enable access same script

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,730
just

00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,880
yes so here is where you see that we

00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,650
actually just look up stuff from the

00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,770
kubernetes api that should be accessible

00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:05,620
on the worker anyway so whatever creates

00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:07,480
the policies within silk to do that

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,970
easily as well CFC are already has

00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,760
clustered credentials from the on there

00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:17,460
there's not much to change around it if

00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:19,990
I now rerun this again array but

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:24,480
anything else you won't see or have

00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:24,480
questions I can go into the actual code

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:39,610
will this work for for me non CFC are

00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:43,090
deployed cluster sure if you I mean the

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:55,270
thing we did on kubernetes itself so

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:58,480
here's the pipeline let's just it should

00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:02,020
because the only thing we did was to

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,600
co-locate the policy stuff because

00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:08,410
someone needs to take care of creating

00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,570
VIP table rules so apart from that the

00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:17,770
cluster is pretty much vanilla we just

00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:20,410
co-located a few jobs template you'd

00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:23,350
have to create a daemon set and like get

00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:25,330
those job running on every part so you

00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,580
definitely need them on the workers and

00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,710
I think you end up having them on the

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,800
master as well because this is where

00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:35,050
queue proxy runs from and Hugh proxy

00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:39,160
needs to be able to access the silk

00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:41,740
eyepiece so those service Service IPS

00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,090
will still work the thing is with the

00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,700
service eyepiece I mean they're just

00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:48,480
destination net to the actual pod IP

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,980
that gets assigned from this unite and

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,610
therefore the master needs to know about

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:57,990
it but that also works and I can what's

00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,990
the cube proxy

00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:06,380
I think when we make the pull request

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:08,750
right for CFC our then we can we will

00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,140
just add the job with the silk job in

00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,590
there

00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:16,370
just add another UPS file so and the

00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:18,740
actual logic is hidden behind the ANA

00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:21,260
Center wrapper but that is again just so

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:28,160
kubernetes does not fail looking up the

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:33,050
IP address so it's just either if it

00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:35,450
said the default call do disks or change

00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,160
to scope link because that's as well our

00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:42,860
kubernetes would fail look up the IP

00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:45,230
address of the actual pod and then the

00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:48,290
CNI wrapper itself is not too

00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:53,030
complicated I mean I'm just changing up

00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:55,910
a few things in whatever gets passed to

00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:57,920
the actual silk binaries it would be

00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,960
super nice if there was a way I guess

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,190
it's like a really hard thing to request

00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,280
there be super nice if there's a way to

00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,960
do this like a bit more abstractly than

00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,940
CFC are like it seems like this needs to

00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,460
be kind of in CS yokes and used to patch

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,530
into NS enter we'd be really nice like

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,810
Mac says if it could be a demon set so

00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:17,360
that it was kind of applicable to any

00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,250
communities C SEO is great but there's

00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,890
like a lot of people using various other

00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:24,650
Cuban at theses yeah but that should not

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:27,080
be a problem so I think you should be

00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:31,520
able to do that by a demon said nothing

00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:34,460
we have here is so specific that it's

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,100
working so the only thing that's missing

00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,590
now is whatever we do with IP table

00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:46,730
rules and I gotta admit when we started

00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:48,920
this I had no idea about that started so

00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,080
this is what I came up with there's

00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,180
still a few things that were a

00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,970
work-in-progress like every having the

00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:58,280
master in there and also doing the IP

00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:00,230
tables for all the workers currently

00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,490
it's only working with one worker but

00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:06,020
essentially we pretty much allow to

00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,440
implement the kubernetes networking

00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,680
model from within a workers 24 range or

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,320
all of the workers 24

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,510
I signed 24 range we need to make sure

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,810
that stuff in cube system or cube public

00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:25,960
name spaces has to be available but then

00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:29,080
again this could be done within the

00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,260
actual an extra plugin

00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:34,180
so the CNI config gives you a list of

00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:37,180
plugins to call and we could just have a

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:41,410
silk kubernetes plugin that then takes

00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:44,020
care of those extra steps and apart from

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:47,710
that we don't really do much so we

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:50,200
change up the namespace and depart and

00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:52,570
get again on the reference so we can

00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,260
utilize that it's the policy ID later on

00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:59,410
and just inject a little bit into the

00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:11,530
call to the silk the original CNI

00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:15,040
wrapper plugin I entered deploys I mean

00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:18,370
I had no manual intervention whatsoever

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,490
the CF itself just add an extra ops file

00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:23,650
for exposing silk and scaling everything

00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,810
to one because we wanted to share save

00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:29,080
resources there's no point in having

00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:30,820
more than one on CF side but it will be

00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,580
probably a bit tricky to figure out the

00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:36,190
whole networking why IP tables within a

00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,410
cube cluster itself and it's also

00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,660
obviously limited to IP tables for the

00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:43,390
moment because that's also it works so

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:57,280
not know IP vs for example like calico

00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:59,830
or we've let you do super cool so we

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,910
still have about 18 minutes is there

00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:07,150
anything else for us no I mean I was

00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:09,790
told I would have 15 to maybe 30 minutes

00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,680
so I just tried to keep it short I don't

00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,110
want to waste anyone's time because this

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:18,210
is the gist of it it works and it's a

00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:20,410
nice thing to have for the future okay

00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,810
let's see if we have any err no question

00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:25,090
otherwise we can give everybody back 15

00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:29,050
more minutes their time

00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:32,880
when Wednesday Thursday morning no

00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:37,950
questions let's see if there's any like

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:40,829
chat questions no okay

00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:43,530
going once no so maybe it would be nice

00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:46,440
if some have someone with more knowledge

00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:53,930
about iptables or whatever can help

00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:53,930
Kumsusan out to just if yes the time

00:38:54,349 --> 00:39:01,650
community I can take of somebody like

00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:04,319
Dimitri but not get a volunteer I'm

00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:07,799
sorry we we have some knowledge in

00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:11,010
garden of iptables so feel free to ping

00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:13,200
in hashtag garden and we can we can see

00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:18,569
and although iptables is I think a

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:20,790
terrible so everyone so yeah police

00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:22,049
inside you can try to help yeah or maybe

00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:27,960
another another solution

00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:29,369
I don't know yeah I'm actually also got

00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,339
that obviously The Container networking

00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:34,559
people like they they'll have ideas or

00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:39,260
people who did silk I'm sure they would

00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,260
they would be happy to help out yeah

00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:49,500
okay any other questions comments

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,530
sorry Muslim just died no no that's fine

00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,030
I think we're at the end anyways or I

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:57,660
think you consistent stopping Wayne

00:39:54,030 --> 00:40:01,890
everybody we'll talk again in March and

00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:04,559
then for April we will do it live as we

00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:09,030
do usually at CF summit I'm working out

00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:10,650
the schedule with that we'll talk next

00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:13,280
month hi everybody
