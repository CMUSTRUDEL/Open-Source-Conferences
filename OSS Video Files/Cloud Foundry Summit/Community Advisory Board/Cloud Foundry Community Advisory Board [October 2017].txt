I know I don't still don't have a use

00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,069
case we could be a person like you

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,410
anyways especially if the networking

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,990
still does right and quite yeah I am

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,090
quite know if right now can I build a

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,389
service instance or a service broker

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,949
that plays things too Kubo and doesn't

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,660
is there a way to expose that to its

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,210
routing thing that the apps can talk to

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,789
it is that solved or a still left with a

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,340
routing problem that I have every time

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,650
after your service broker service gives

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,210
that slight thing it is just incredible

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:36,989
in 2017 that every conversation about

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,600
cloud battery it's like the open child

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,190
bed turned up to Christmas and feather

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,670
breakfast but we don't refer to them as

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,520
a member of the family just services are

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,570
so under discussed and under supported

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,730
mm-hmm under considered we however we

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,320
have the buzz word there basically told

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,739
us like a buzz word three months would

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,019
look even at ease now you've got like an

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,780
opinionated way if you've decided that

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,580
you can't just run your data service

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,010
like everyone has been moved 20 years of

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,530
the recently by getting a really large

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,680
bare metal box and running vertically

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,770
scale database on it with a backup you

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,320
can now use kubernetes do that for some

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,210
reason that makes you happy well I'm

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,780
excited for the lifecycle of larger

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,659
clusters I'd like to see more people

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:34,770
exploring the world of long-lived highly

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,869
available clusters of things I disagree

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:44,009
um I think we'll mostly say I'm wrong

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:46,189
about what so let me Curb Your

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,189
Enthusiasm

00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:57,360
the idea is whoever speaking so yes I

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,290
think you very Marge clusters well most

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,619
people who've actually run those

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,030
bastards fight is there is much better

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,890
to pull the state out those clusters

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,049
right that's what we're talking about

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,800
which are the master of Postgres for

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:13,379
example right I think having so I think

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,069
having 400 Postgres servers it's not a

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,260
great way

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,480
some recommended configuration of

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,670
running Postgres right if you have a

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,489
traditional database hang on are we

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,780
talking about 400 users of Postgres

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:26,340
you're saying you'd rather have one

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,409
Postgres pastor arrived I'd rather have

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,140
one large maintained Postgres cluster

00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:33,450
because actually the big problems of

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,430
maintaining a Postgres are not technical

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,650
problems they are operational problems

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,780
you have to run ops you have to manage

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,790
that Postgres have to scheme it you have

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,790
to recover it isn't the idea of running

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,409
one Postgres akin in their so saying

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,500
there we shouldn't use cloud package

00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:51,540
just not touch that box ever again I

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,099
mean all or something like we went down

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,720
the path of the world native adapts and

00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,489
we learnt and not write to the file

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,379
system are gonna be ephemeral right we

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,629
build up yes strengths around the best

00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,659
end we know how to write yes so but we

00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:05,459
don't know how run long lived how

00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,739
available donor babies look we refused

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,590
to talk about it I think I think it

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,709
turns out we sort of do but the point is

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,840
not everyone needs to this is what

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,639
Google found with MapReduce right they

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,549
didn't want everyone reinventing how to

00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,840
process large amounts of data right but

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,970
everyone in the company needed to

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,739
process large loads of data so what did

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,720
they do they had the people who

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,419
understand how to build scalable

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,209
clustered stuff for a build that and

00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:36,750
then everyone else just writes map jobs

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,430
and reduce jobs and now has it run wins

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,780
where does that make or break down in

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,000
the cloud boundary world as an app

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,159
developer I don't care about post graves

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,620
yeah that doesn't mean that I want my

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,000
post Chris I don't I don't care

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,829
fundamentally I don't care whether my

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,510
Postgres database design shared machine

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,030
or not right until there is a thing

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,049
which I do care let me put it this way

00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,180
RDS exists right over time I think the

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,340
direction of travel is for things that

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,900
look like IDs right now there were some

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,939
reasons not to use things like that

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,169
because they're still expensive but

00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,790
they're going to get less and less

00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:09,449
expensive as we get better and better at

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,280
running them

00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,780
I can't imagine why you'd want to run

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,139
your own on yes there is such a

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:21,090
hilariously solved problem having a

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:23,669
database like that that to me the

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,169
platform provides and the platform maybe

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,210
someone in your company there may be a

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,750
team who is providing your highly

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,790
available

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,310
eight days but the way we generally run

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,980
those things like Liam fans peace you

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,660
get from containerization aren't really

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,850
advantages that help you much with this

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,880
databases don't get modified often

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,790
you're doing rapid development

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,370
assessment yes my entire story I I

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,650
appreciate we sang so I'd like a fight

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,780
my story of this it's not necessary a

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,220
story of the app development stuff to

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,710
care more about this people sitting at

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,080
Katanga so if the app developers still

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,120
doesn't care which is why I could

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,919
confuse modules fascination communities

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,570
and same trainings are interesting yes

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,780
all things are not interest exactly

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,910
right I mean so just verb anyone

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,650
watching historically for the last two

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,360
years I was doing a thing called Ingo

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,370
PostgreSQL which was like on-demand

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,520
provision two containers of Postgres

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,370
inside those containers it did the whole

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,530
lifecycle of forming a cluster a TED CD

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,950
for coordination of leadership had a

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,140
thing called Patroni which did the the

00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,970
state machine of what role to play I

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,440
must configure and locally to be a my

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,720
leader of whatever will flush the

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,479
databases or do backup automatically

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,800
restore or macro stuff it back be

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,040
dropped on Cuban headings that could be

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,760
dropped on a container platform what I

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,100
didn't have was an answer to how do I do

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,870
the networking and the and the the

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,640
continual rotation of credentials we

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,620
talk about is aligning obviously we want

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,169
continual rotation of credentials zero

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,150
effort has gone into the cap services

00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:59,729
being rotated so hey this is what I'm

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,470
getting it right so it might be so for

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:03,090
something like that coop is going to

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,740
solve your problems today your

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,200
experiences actually doesn't it doesn't

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,840
read anything out of this case exactly

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,430
but perhaps something does what I would

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,930
argue is that what's happened this week

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,910
and I think it's the right thing if I'm

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,880
honest is that we've made a decision

00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,950
that CF isn't what's going to solve that

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,930
problem by the problem of running that

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,390
cluster post race we used to be using is

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,650
it our CF include like different things

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,690
that pertain to Orkut rate since their

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,110
attractions they're not there is

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,790
container n times and coud mainly not

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,620
solve your problem and frankly I think

00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,460
most problems are better sold by not

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,289
doing that stuff in that stateful

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,580
environment CF is going to focus on

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,979
we're gonna make it really easy

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,289
push your app and bind to someone else a

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,360
solution back right so see it's really

00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:51,060
important thing about that is that the

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,439
number of people who are pushing apps is

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,629
large and they're getting pushed

00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,009
repeatedly and waiting repeatedly you do

00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:57,780
rapid development on them that you

00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,789
really want to speed up and there is

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,039
value me out to a really fast they're

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:03,659
getting new vertical apps out so on the

00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,669
other hand you can solve the problem of

00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,349
being able to deploy a database for

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,330
someone or frankly just get highly

00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:12,930
scalable database and pull out an

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:15,060
account once in one team and it's solved

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,280
I don't need that to be made

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,259
substantially faster in the same way I

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,050
need app developer to be a subset of the

00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:24,419
cluster right again your role as an app

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,129
developers you don't care right I roll

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,990
as trying to provide the database on

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:29,639
demand right whether it's what I'm

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,969
saying but is anything coyotes may

00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,560
exceptionally difficult in this place to

00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:36,599
provide so that was another thing I was

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,520
gonna say I do think we are now starting

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,110
to get now that we realize that there's

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,909
two separate things there's kind of

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,349
foundry which isn't going to try and

00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:44,699
solve the problem running those things

00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:46,349
there's actually the problem of

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,889
kubernetes is trying to solve too many

00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:49,169
problems

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,180
I think clarify to me is going to be a

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,250
focus thing there's also called more

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,779
famous apps now that you've made that

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,969
decision I would say includes upside

00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,529
that wears off the site now we can try

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:00,690
and solve this and what I think is the

00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,430
real way which is now have this end of

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,409
Orion s Ischia work that we're talking

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,300
about this contains from saying that

00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:08,339
working all that stuff it's not about

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,349
running those things look forward it's

00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:12,719
about actually saying these things

00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:15,690
amongst going on outside platform how

00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:17,669
can you make it really well okay so

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,440
anyone that's not here to miss the whole

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,180
the other exciting thing to me is

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,870
probably not keeping any so much as

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:28,169
their networking sites SEO in boy stuff

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,069
so what's exciting about that is as I

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:32,459
understand

00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:34,649
Google themselves put local proxies next

00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:36,269
to apps to say and that's your app talks

00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:39,300
or local proxy as a representation

00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:42,719
sidecar is the only word 2017 for this

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,579
proxy you talk to the sidecar and the

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,160
sidecar is entirely responsible for that

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,899
the security the load balancing the

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,630
relationship that failover reached on

00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,579
your app can be stupid about it and

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,779
that's why it's big fan of console when

00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:55,260
it came out because it's like the only

00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,870
thing

00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,880
hey now you don't talk to the constant

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,980
servers talk to console agent we'll deal

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,680
with that so I love that pet the psyche

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,990
I've had so that was exciting on day one

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,330
when they first saw that their

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,920
presentation right and then and then

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,030
you're watching out I'm going oh my god

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,610
you are never gonna say it are you

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,290
you're not going to say services you

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,050
only used the word services was to talk

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,910
about other apps and that whole talk it

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,800
was all about apps talking to other apps

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,890
they could not get out of their head

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,340
Cloud Foundry has a responsibility to

00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:33,870
talk to external things and for external

00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:36,300
things to manage their relationship yeah

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,830
let's see what other people have been

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,790
interest to the baby you've a chance

00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,060
yeah this is pretty cool

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:46,170
so East you or somebody else anybody

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,150
else Cornelius what do you think in

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:52,410
terms of what you see or you've been

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:54,810
adding up to any question I'm mostly a

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,550
to listen to understand especially if

00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,950
you're for example of something that I'm

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,360
not familiar with yet more about it at

00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,720
this conference oh that's interesting I

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,630
like a concept that's let's see let's

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,040
see what comes from that I've had more

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,840
work to run it is there some more

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,670
opinions but also there I think it's

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,080
really we have to listen to what people

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:19,020
actually do I wouldn't try to push an

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:23,670
opinion well let me ask you this because

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:26,670
I saw your talk which is where you guys

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,820
from Susie or I guess announced a

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:33,000
product where you can get Cloud Foundry

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,890
running on top of a good cluster and you

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,920
have a solution for this which uses I

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:41,400
guess followed the HP thing where you

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,040
visualize I use the word crazy it's

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,560
abortion cases yeah so maybe talk to us

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:53,370
about that that would be a sure other

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:57,950
people yeah Oh for me yeah but that's

00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:04,650
okay that's that's here is it seeing you

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:06,930
yeah it's not seeing okay yes all right

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:10,550
sorry so I don't want to talk too much

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,550
about the product but it's not blow

00:11:10,699 --> 00:12:38,189
interesting and into into image so we

00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:40,079
are doing the one thing I mean obviously

00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:43,379
you and I will carry over this fires

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,719
engine it is that once you do this in

00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:48,119
you guys will keep updating and they can

00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:50,939
use it but you also lose something which

00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:54,329
is that if you were using brush to do

00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:58,049
some of your operation you now have to

00:12:54,329 --> 00:13:00,029
deal with that right so at runtime then

00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:01,739
you don't use push anymore so for some

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,089
of you as infrastructure and that's the

00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,769
experience that has built up the

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:06,629
knowledge to operate there are things

00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:09,929
with Bosch them it's probably the right

00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:11,099
choice so if you don't do that but

00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:14,389
you're coming from a community's

00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:16,649
perspective then you might not want to

00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:18,899
what are the other reasons like I heard

00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:22,589
that you're a billionaire rotate or

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:26,329
update Diego sales is a lot faster for

00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:26,329
their other benefits like operationally

00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:32,279
we not know what town terribly these the

00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:34,589
watch world trivia yeah I mean what one

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,779
ting which which i think is nice

00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:39,179
advantages that you run other

00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:41,279
containerized it's much more easy to you

00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,139
to put it in a small small footprint so

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,939
you can run phone game on virtual

00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:48,929
machine you can start the fact they

00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:52,229
don't be 20 to start with you have

00:13:48,929 --> 00:14:01,409
flashlights but you wouldn't run there

00:13:52,229 --> 00:14:05,479
are you could try one bien you had

00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:13,139
that's another great pack yeah my advice

00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:21,089
getting that I'm completely then you can

00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:26,459
see I mean you can't you know before

00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:29,869
like you might do that today can

00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,869
co-locate them as long as you I'm

00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:34,669
especially now we have to begin the

00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:37,889
process our campaign right they run

00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:40,169
clash

00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:44,159
why concerned you guys is that you've

00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:47,309
such a long history by the long little

00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,289
limb staff and you start of wanting to

00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:50,999
do things the way of doing them that

00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,550
with is ever the chance that you'll

00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:55,790
actually

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,560
go back to doing it with Bosch I know

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,180
Bosch wasn't very good five years ago

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,100
when you decided not to use by stuff

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,899
like them understand and the one thing I

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:08,959
didn't tell you we use a chameleon boy

00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:11,060
and you know we didn't decide to people

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,560
in the Bosch team were working with we

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,540
are providing for stem cells we are

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,320
working on the CPI and I'm not trying to

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:22,010
be something as I said I think they're

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,320
different different okay so you got the

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,779
car location all right so you could

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,760
union jam all these BM or the Bosch jobs

00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:31,250
into a smaller kubernetes footprint

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,779
rather thing like I turned it was faster

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,060
to update is there any other sort of I

00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:38,649
mean spinning up containers as fast so

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,649
you don't have to do the recompilation

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,630
but I would argue that all these

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,649
technical differences that's probably

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,110
something where you can find

00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:50,480
optimizations and solutions I mean you

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,830
know I think it's reading from I don't

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:58,339
adhere that's more my personal view

00:15:51,830 --> 00:16:01,279
here's what kind of ecosystem what are

00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:03,620
you familiar music did you do after that

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,180
but where do you go because two days

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:09,740
it's not like it's 20 years old like

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:11,570
it's all very new special ed to me is

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,670
how you deploy your cube Annette right

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,290
because I'm really interested now that

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,810
there's this way of the point connected

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,920
with Bosch that's that seems like it

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,459
gives you its opportunity to manage

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,899
everything and with with that you have

00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,790
to deploy your cube somehow right you've

00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,529
got your coop in the first place whether

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,140
that's with chef or hands or whatever

00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:32,029
but that to me is the question of is

00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,310
Bosch actually a potentially use case

00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:36,170
that because as soon as your the pull of

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,790
cube with Bosch then I think you should

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,040
justify yourself watching now you really

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,620
do have just one thing to learn right

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,810
right the question is is it practical

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,310
for you to before the coop with Bosch

00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,380
and if not why not

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,540
what's that like what does that look

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,680
like in your organization or in fast

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:57,260
it's not really the question because a

00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,079
product we just assume acumen just

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,660
doesn't matter well runs but we

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,000
maintained by Google cook Viacom 20

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,039
disaster service or people use whatever

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,299
they are

00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:10,970
you're saying you don't care is that

00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:13,669
what you say we've been completely not

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:16,999
caring because we care that it works so

00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:18,019
it should work but for textual point of

00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:22,429
view it doesn't really matter because

00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:24,919
our interfaces your alt will help help

00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:27,619
well being a cloud battery he is still

00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,240
proportional and restricted by the

00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:34,190
health and welfare of the coop college

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:36,759
store they care yeah but I think I think

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,759
people

00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:43,039
Cornelius is kind of view of it is that

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,769
people want to have one solution in

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:51,289
terms of you know you have a continual

00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:54,740
form and in solutions you have to keep

00:17:51,289 --> 00:18:02,570
some no I understand but the point I'm

00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:05,720
making is that it's the idea of like why

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:09,139
do like I guess you know if you're

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,499
treating these VMs as like the main

00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:14,629
resource that you're paying for if you

00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:17,539
now put containers on top of these

00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:19,039
things you increase the density right

00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:22,879
all of a sudden because you can now

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:25,460
maybe use code of your engine part of

00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:27,950
your cluster IP run clapping tree would

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,809
shrink it alright people desperately

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,149
wanted to see if deployment see if

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:35,389
release and fall footprint massively

00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:36,919
smaller because it can shop it's a

00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:39,110
defensive not the right word but there's

00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:41,840
scratching a that's such a long live

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,059
pine of mine then it's not fair to say

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,559
oh we have two days that's so problems

00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:57,470
like this you know we should solve it

00:18:45,559 --> 00:19:00,649
deal differently okay so let's let's

00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:09,049
jump off the kubernetes unless unless

00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:11,360
somebody has conservatives right

00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:13,879
torsional castrates processes

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,190
it's nothing about containers it gives

00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:18,769
you great density if you want face no no

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,800
no wait if you want great density tell

00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:22,040
watched for more the

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,420
focuses on the same BM you're now done

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,890
we already can containerize those

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,810
processes you have this little song

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,460
could run see the rapper called BPM

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,590
which most account engine components now

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,120
using which means you can put all of the

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:36,210
things on one cell if you like and

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,780
button or coach make them unique right

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:42,360
now you've anu the new NEBOSH operator

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,610
felt thing hasn't actually made it

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,320
simple and say like a space deployment

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,210
that's ten instant groups I'd like to

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,620
move trees actually hasn't helped with

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,990
that at all I think I think you guys

00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,660
keep missing this point you know and you

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,040
especially do is that when I mentioned

00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,560
higher density I'm not talking just

00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,210
about not foundry I'm an organization

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,090
where I'm learning services and let's

00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,620
say the table here is my sort of

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,840
footprint for the pow

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,460
maybe carpentry is just this piece the

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,800
rest of the table is services for

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,550
there's people running just Kubb and so

00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:24,210
on and having a unified way of dealing

00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:24,690
with this is a great not so sure about

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,250
that

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,380
I think that goes back to the beginning

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,290
of the discussion people want to run on

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,870
containers for like you know there

00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,540
Cassandra databases I'm told we should

00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:42,870
provide containers like I'm trying to be

00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:51,870
bright so also using now I should have

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:53,220
multiple container because you're gonna

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,440
need something that solves how do I

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,480
deploy this below summarizes and then

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,640
you've got what is the abstraction I

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,890
will run the top of that and humanity

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,240
sees one tip on these one goods or

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:09,260
perhaps about one of our Nomad if I were

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,380
an opportunity but it's lightweight you

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:15,840
keep on saying you know I have my

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,350
container clusters that I'm deferring to

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,390
cloud to coop and maybe I'm using Bosh

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,980
to do that and then part of that is

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,350
running some Cloud Foundry

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,170
workloads although that is running I

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,060
don't know like my database is part of

00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:32,520
that it was in my service and so on and

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,539
I have a unified way of deploying all

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,999
these things

00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:37,590
beautiful that's what they're trying to

00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,850
agree that you should have a unified way

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,799
these things

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,259
yeah because kubernetes can deploy

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,109
kubernetes the only possible unified way

00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:56,369
of deploying all these things I'm not

00:21:46,109 --> 00:22:00,330
arguing against watch Donald Trump

00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:09,299
approach to I'm not saying everyone's

00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:11,039
kind of health care with Macy cuts which

00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:14,729
is essentially having cloud foundry on

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,200
top of qu the part that I cannot you

00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:17,940
know did disappointed maybe not

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,369
disappointed but I wish could happen is

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,499
that I don't have to change the way I

00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:25,830
manage my company because that's what I

00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:27,269
lose and second and I agree that's a big

00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,190
problem but I'm wondering if there's a

00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:31,470
way to solve it right is there a way to

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,989
you do that deployment and then you can

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:37,950
still use Bosch maybe to some CLI

00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:40,799
extension to keep managing the founder

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:44,159
instance to do that maybe talks to coop

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,349
I don't know I'm wondering I feel like

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:52,649
you're having fun I think there is like

00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:53,970
something's something's best but it's

00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:58,379
herb less something is the best a lot of

00:22:53,970 --> 00:23:01,019
like retainers and things by Bosch and

00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:04,049
the points about this is I need to be

00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,789
able to develop a distributed system and

00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,859
use the primitives that make sense me to

00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:10,259
develop like this reputed system right

00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:11,820
and the people who decide that on the

00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:13,799
developers of that system right if I

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,269
develop something that uses the

00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,789
kubernetes abstractions to keep myself

00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,499
highly available or clustered I need you

00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:22,470
to give me a cube let's discuss that so

00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:24,269
that if I if I design it with surplus I

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,729
need a service that's back the car

00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:29,009
foundry developers currently have

00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:31,349
designed it based around wash because

00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:33,779
Bosch makes their life simple keeping a

00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:35,519
highly available system when you with

00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,229
much about there are restrictions in

00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,200
barge there are things that we have to

00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:42,570
design for Bosch and then Bosh gives us

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,840
a lot for free right and that's why CF

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:47,190
uses Bosch now you can kind of try and

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,130
put kubernetes in there

00:23:47,190 --> 00:25:31,380
underneath I think as long as the using

00:23:50,130 --> 00:25:33,840
any of its features today yes so don't

00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:45,090
use the argument that the developers

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:49,440
choose because we are the dreamers now

00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:51,090
if you take you take box releases -

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,710
you're not going to get much benefit

00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,570
because none of the developers are

00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:58,110
seeing any of that or using anything on

00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:01,140
hang on all right the pretext everything

00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,670
you've seen has been that the developers

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,440
that chooses and though it's all about

00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,000
their benefit but Bosch wasn't built for

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,220
the developers of Claire pantry Bosch

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,050
was built for the s eries operators I

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,550
disagree who disagree because they're

00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,170
the same and they were the same there

00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:18,900
were the poor sods don't live with the

00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:21,450
chef's orientated one we used to see a

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,010
push to production all the sorry we used

00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,420
to Bosch complete virtually all the time

00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,610
so when the states for the Memphis is

00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,860
because we were responsible to Google

00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,750
model you get Rs re eventually we've got

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,310
fed up eventually initially we were

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,470
responsible to get to production and

00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,680
Bosch let has not think about that too

00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,420
much

00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,310
they solved that problem for us so we

00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:56,490
use them maybe now we would use a better

00:26:38,310 --> 00:27:03,410
one and maybe in six months all I'm

00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:03,410
saying all I'm saying is we could decide

00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:12,510
until we decide who until you decide to

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,130
use it then it's going to be limited

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,110
advantage that has to be a decision that

00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,030
we make as developers in the community

00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,640
and then to use it which we could do

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,290
we'd like we change it all the time we

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,240
don't even we throw a con limit which I

00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,800
wrote and maybe garden run say and I'm

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,170
glad we did it and was probably lots

00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,700
more stars but it has to be fun within

00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:34,470
the community discussion so you you're

00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,010
asking to do it and that's what we're

00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:56,180
doing so let's see if there's on this

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:59,460
topic of today's ask me I know like yeah

00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,260
theory it doesn't make sense your own

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,900
opinion in this regard because there

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:10,190
could be multiple use cases so I just

00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:15,290
wanted other container and times I'm new

00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:15,290
so for the container

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:41,580
standard interfaces so that other

00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:43,620
container I plug them plugins nowadays

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,200
which I think if coupe was a smaller

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,580
thing and I would agree much more

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,630
quickly with this point of our let's

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,909
just use our let's have this one

00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,650
standard thing tube is a very large

00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:55,490
thing to me to support and understand

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:57,390
and honestly personally as a developer I

00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,950
wouldn't want to support something

00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:02,100
really low key abilities like right now

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,929
today if something blows up the amount

00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,280
that I have to understand to support one

00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:09,299
of these systems such as in really large

00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,370
and rapidly growing right and is not

00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:12,840
something that solves a problem I have

00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,390
there are people whose problems it

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,159
solves brilliantly like people like some

00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:20,250
of the things dr. Nick was saying a

00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,440
brilliant use cases for this but but we

00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,330
don't have these problems so why why we

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:29,880
want to kind of volunteer totally I mean

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:36,330
there are places for me it's meant to

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:38,400
bring of course it's it's just bringing

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:42,929
more complexity in a system that is

00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:45,120
already complain and I mean I I was

00:29:42,929 --> 00:30:00,990
lured back Henry in one fell swoop we

00:29:45,120 --> 00:30:06,090
went for an already massively complex I

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:08,990
think one of the things that and it

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:11,220
seemed like we were fixing problems that

00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,620
right because they didn't have a week

00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,990
before I didn't have they two operations

00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,789
are there now we're announcing container

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,830
services but there's not enough detail

00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:22,020
to understand content of run to run

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:27,390
times still not a bad service it's still

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:28,890
a bad and in it and it does and it seems

00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,920
like it's gonna fix for them

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:34,770
and very clear so I think I think trying

00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:37,560
to identify this and and and figuring it

00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:49,170
out and of course you have different

00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:52,530
solutions and I see the year of service

00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:56,880
and the functions day of singing and

00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:59,190
reading application is not arrived this

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,660
year right but I'll see like 20 later on

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:06,210
dat you know 2019 is there will be app

00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,590
like tools that will be coming out like

00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,200
how you design the workflows and

00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:12,390
invoking functions and you have various

00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,900
versions of functions and how to do that

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:23,280
and develop that so what did you use

00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:24,930
Bosch by the way I think I think I think

00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,300
this is the mediumship thing about its

00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,770
consider an application one right there

00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,080
was this confusion the what we should be

00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,610
doing in that patient one time it's dust

00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,000
this is container stuff and it's more

00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:37,170
complex Lance I actually think the more

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,610
we can like to forget about this I'm

00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,890
saying that's cumulates is they will

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,600
stand up you make easy to manage to do

00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,490
that including the moment we can lean

00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,050
towards this stuff which is I think

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,610
where we really had it and should have

00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,440
which is I don't want to think about

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,510
containers or packaging or orchestration

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,490
or anything I'm sana push-button having

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,260
work combines we should constantly

00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:57,660
asking the question what would make me

00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,010
happy as a developer and and one thing

00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,400
I'll say about is one thing that I think

00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:04,500
is is interesting about this stuff is

00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:07,080
what what what we have to be careful

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,560
about this music aunty's around and they

00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,510
can be really good but if you just add

00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,000
things away you tend to just add

00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,490
complexity so if you took bunch and

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,320
replace the clean yes okay now we could

00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,480
have a discussion if you take all the

00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,760
same stack and like add another layer

00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,800
then I think it tends to just add

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,180
another layer right I think that's where

00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,600
we have to be careful about this whole

00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:32,670
thing is there something to be said for

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,290
just keeping three simple systems rather

00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,000
than one very complex I like that we're

00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:41,880
taking the networking ideas and some of

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,900
the code that's nice what do you think

00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:53,610
about the future

00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:56,850
to push containers to something which

00:32:53,610 --> 00:33:02,220
should be in the which is why I would

00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:04,170
say no I think is the orchestrator one

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,660
time versus the application was like are

00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,309
you gonna care about orchestration it's

00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,930
lovely that you can push code and we'll

00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:11,880
just run it but to be honest there are

00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:14,160
many use cases we're just crazy an image

00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,170
and pushing it is great I don't think

00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,550
you're getting to all the extra stuff

00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:19,350
you can do to orchestrate makes for

00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:22,020
payment and customize them for being a

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:24,390
ship your code to me in a pre-compiled

00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:27,000
way it seems great and one thing we've

00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:29,429
been working on is to use layers whose

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,400
ozone is more in the platform so what

00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:33,840
I'd love to get to is for one day build

00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,000
packs are just another way of building

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,250
an image and when you stage with the

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,100
build pack you just get a URL and it's a

00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:44,220
docker hub silo URL like an OCR URL and

00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,260
it stays patched over time so I can use

00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,420
co-founders to stage that and then

00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,910
because we use build that model it will

00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:53,610
keep being a patched image over time I

00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:55,380
can take that push it to coop so when

00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,910
you want their development efficiency

00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,860
and rapid application development of

00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,630
class fountain you can either use build

00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,280
tackle you stuff from FEMA will do that

00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,170
then as soon as you want to call the

00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,010
escape action you need all this stuff if

00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,140
that should ever happen

00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:09,540
you take that image that you staged and

00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,800
you know that that exact same thing will

00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,510
run on Google ethics and it's the

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,100
identical thing and it's the thing that

00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,990
will keep catching that music that song

00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,250
from your crappy arguing selection and

00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,960
then you have something that I think

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:21,240
works really well like container images

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,070
are great right again and what I think

00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,830
is great for their that we have that I

00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,659
skate punch but they have this problem

00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:32,879
then once you've lots of great yo

00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:34,500
container you're served responsible but

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,020
you have to make but you have to accept

00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,639
if you use the build pack model if some

00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,540
things which aren't as easy but we can

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,730
keep it patched

00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,590
because we prevent it sometimes one so

00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,290
I'll keep that patched over time there's

00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:48,389
nothing that's actually orthogonal

00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:50,220
images to it'll be an image let's let's

00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:52,950
see if there is a if there's a question

00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:55,620
or like comment in terms of things that

00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,790
were as interesting besides you know

00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:06,810
crouppen

00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:12,350
containers hangouts highlight no I think

00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:12,350
Nick which is which is ready to see

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:22,140
actually iPhone it cool

00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:26,720
I'm sorry with I mean it brings some

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:34,410
more life it might sound like it's chaos

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:41,370
because we are not sure reading

00:35:34,410 --> 00:36:40,950
disability I want to say I think we

00:35:41,370 --> 00:37:08,600
should do this please stop saying it's

00:36:40,950 --> 00:37:08,600
gonna break the disintegrator I think

00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:32,340
I can tell you I was talking together

00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:34,859
created their ideas that yes to try to

00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:42,090
make it a little bit better to integrate

00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:48,210
between together okay let's see if

00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:50,160
there's anything else great here in

00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:53,210
Basel in terms of the fun transportation

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,740
yeah I've been hanging out in there the

00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,750
venue like every other venue I know but

00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,280
this different City once you're inside

00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:11,970
the building you completely feel a

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:15,390
country just just slowed down a lot yeah

00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:25,380
I sort of forgot that the audience looks

00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:28,859
like another room in English you're a

00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:34,950
small company and you come here was it

00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:38,520
worth it like meeting you yeah I mean we

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:40,440
have old customers and and a new one but

00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,560
was it was it useful to you at being

00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:51,090
here to meet more like folks that you

00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:58,290
did not expect my time zeroes of like

00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:59,609
it's my chance people making leading so

00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:02,690
I do spend a little bit of time catching

00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:08,580
with the customers and prospects yeah

00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:19,950
reminders and I get pretty unique

00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:23,970
opportunity this year it's necessary to

00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:28,800
meet people it's so much different

00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:32,040
when you are face-to-face like super

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,890
driven customer customer have been using

00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,050
Bosch backspace alert I would never have

00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:40,280
started any conversation over the net

00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:44,250
about this whole project here I could

00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:48,510
and I could meet all the guys I've been

00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:54,270
seeing around remotely but it's not

00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:56,910
saying and so I guess the point here

00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:59,250
people watching if you decided not to

00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,390
come because you thought it was worth

00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,460
not worth it

00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:05,070
obviously there's costs associated with

00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,780
it but put that aside there's very good

00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:09,780
reason to them right because you get to

00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:11,970
chance if you're doing anything with

00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,570
open source projects tickets issues

00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:17,310
using this is you know it's you start to

00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:19,530
you already notice people buy their

00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:21,600
handles or whatever and actually you

00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,890
don't just walk in as a stranger like

00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,390
you walk in and you've got people

00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:28,860
excited to see to me that's a good

00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:35,610
conference about conferences window at

00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:38,540
the far enough conference a great

00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:41,730
conference is all about would happen so

00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:48,630
it's like doing this right the faculty

00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:54,000
doing this I mean these discussions

00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:57,270
especially sense is being that's why I

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,070
kept on pushing against what what deuce

00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:01,290
was talking about is that do is

00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:04,190
discussion obviously we need more people

00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:06,570
and some teams and so on but that's

00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,490
needs a little bit of more the kepco

00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:17,220
nice little man little bit of more

00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:22,440
promotion I think in India recorded and

00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:26,670
then I think war who live right now

00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,840
he does these summaries and also the

00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,120
people are going to chantix there's

00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,550
chemicals in the bulb now yes I'm for

00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:36,330
share yes I can talk about this a little

00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:37,540
bit so I already know what we're gonna

00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:41,230
be talking about next

00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:43,540
next time there is the guys from orange

00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:47,680
we want to present a terraforming

00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:50,350
solution that they are contribute to CF

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,680
extensions so we have that and then I'm

00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:55,450
working on getting more so too you'll

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,970
see more of the model of having

00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:00,840
presentations getting people to discuss

00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,840
what they are thinking

00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,740
and then some free time but sometimes

00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,850
for discussions because I think that's

00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:12,940
important right it's important to move

00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:15,250
forward not stay stagnant decisions you

00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:17,680
made yesterday they change you have new

00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:42,990
information all right there's also the

00:42:17,680 --> 00:43:28,690
other one yeah continuing possible but

00:42:42,990 --> 00:43:42,960
the benefit was because right after if

00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:50,020
you're watching if you're in Australia

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:50,950
please tell me you exist mosque I must

00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:56,740
clarify

00:43:50,950 --> 00:44:00,940
Tasmania it was awesome there is Telstra

00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:09,190
who might today know that using I could

00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:11,220
see the same friends please alright with

00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,220
