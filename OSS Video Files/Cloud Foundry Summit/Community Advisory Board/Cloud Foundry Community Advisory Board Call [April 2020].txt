Cloud Foundry foundation highlights and

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,490
updates from I believe

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,480
Swarna I see we have chip as well

00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:37,559

let you we won't let you good man on

that note do you want to do to this

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:58,170
honor strip uh yeah let's see would you

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:02,280
would you add in here yet so it's in the

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,920
in the dock right we we had a change at

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,860
the Board of Directors level and just I

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,840
I'm always reminded that some context

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,460
about what the foundation's board does

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,860
is important they're responsible for

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,659
helping to manage the the business of

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,630
the corporation that is the Cloud

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,720
Foundry foundation so they approve

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,710
annual budget they you know work we

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,090
worked very closely with all the

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,710
directors and the board as a whole to

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,570
establish what the priorities for how

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,840
we're gonna the staff will spend its

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,869
time

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,610
supporting the community they helped set

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,079
those priorities for us the you know

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,780
I've said this in other context but I

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,780
just want to maybe reiterate what what

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,299
we're going to be focused on in support

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,030
of everything that you all do there's

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:58,140
really two two key things so the first

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,520
one is that we're gonna be very focused

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,740
on trying to find ways to help the

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,570
community grow and continue to build on

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,690
its a fairly healthy community right

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,629
we've got decent diversity but we can do

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,650
more we can do better right so you know

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,209
Sora and Chris

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,900
as an example it started to reach out to

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:21,450
different project leads to PMC leads to

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,090
say no how can we think about the

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,819
project's being more welcoming for

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,500
casual contribution I think that's a

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,420
that's a key ingredient that we haven't

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,120
been doing particularly well as a

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,890
collective so there's there's areas to

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,470
improve we want to be there to support

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,230
you know everybody in make this room

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:44,400
changes there in the second area of

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,500
focus for us is to is to really simplify

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,510
any of the kind of the marketing of your

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,160
outreach that we do to focus on a very

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:56,000
straightforward story right we as a

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,829
community have a long experience

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,849
providing a great developer centric

00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:05,040
experience to enterprise developers

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,500
everywhere and now that kubernetes has

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,340
shown up everywhere we need to bring

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,599
that developer experience to ku-band

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,420
you know irregardless of what coop

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,090
distribution or you know cloud provider

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,940
offering you're using there's there's a

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,000
pretty significant gap between

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,180
enterprise developer and communities so

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,970
that's that's what we're gonna do around

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,859
outreach activities so we're kind of

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,709
we're simplifying what we do to support

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:37,370
all of you we're we're gonna be very

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:41,220
very focused on those two activities and

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:45,079
I think that that's incredibly

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,609
appropriate given the the state of the

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:50,250
project overall right commercialization

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:52,220
is fairly successful we've got alignment

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,379
around that that kubernetes direction

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,150
even as we work out you know lots of

00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:01,069
details and have really healthy

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,760
discussions you know in the community so

00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:08,459
that's where we're at

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:12,419
let's see what else is in here okay look

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,620
this actually hit the summit we haven't

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,720
officially done any announcement around

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,900
this yet but the North American summit

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,370
is like 99.9% likely it's going to be

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,219
virtual we're gonna change the format

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,960
dramatically we're gonna focus on the

00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:27,370
two audiences that we still planned to

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,860
focus on for an in-person event

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:34,690
which is number one contributing

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:36,760
community number to those members of our

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,680
community that are kind of in that in

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,060
that circle around the core contributors

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,710
right so casual contributors sis that do

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,470
a lot of integration and deployment work

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,540
and app modernization end users that

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,979
that are either using the open-source

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,720
directly or even though the you know

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,210
they they acquire the platform through a

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,250
vendor they're interested in active in

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,100
the upstream community so that's what

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,320
we're gonna try to create virtually

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,880
we're gonna work very closely with the

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,410
Linux Foundation events team they've

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,290
done a lot of work on different

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,639
platforms and tools to use for this and

00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,740
we're gonna do our best to try to create

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,419
something that's not just people staring

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,070
at a zoom screen all day because I think

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:21,130
that's our lives anyway right

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:24,060
so hey you know how do we how do we make

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:27,070
something that's gonna hopefully provide

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:31,300
not just a chance for great talks to be

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:35,770
highlighted and then reused but ideally

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,500
you know the value of any event is in

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,260
you know the hallway track were another

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,250
way to look at it is the serendipitous

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,550
moment of collaboration that you

00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,200
wouldn't expect otherwise so we're gonna

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,030
experiment we're gonna try some new

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,880
things so we'll have more information

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,889
about that kind of shortly in terms of

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,810
the European event who knows at this

00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,900
point we're gonna focus on getting North

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:02,260
America right we'll see what happens you

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,380
know with with the the state of the

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,389
world and travel when everybody's

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,970
feelings of safety around travel and

00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,960
then we'll see what happens so I don't

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,139
think I have anything else

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,919
Swarna did I miss anything critical no I

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:20,770
think that was sorry okay I'm just gonna

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,340
say CFP deadline yeah we pushed that out

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,590
obviously yeah yes Friday we yeah I mean

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,080
people are focusing their families in

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,240
their health and in their day jobs is

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,330
primary topic so we've pushed that out a

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,680
bit so yeah please do submit because

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,599
we're still going to find ways to use

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,930
your great talks yeah it's technically

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,940
this Friday but given the whole new

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,130
my change that is kind of still in the

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,100
works I don't want to speak for the

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,960
entire team but I think we will push

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,720
that out a little more because there's

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,729
no point in closing the culper papers

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,250
before we announce the format change so

00:06:54,729 --> 00:07:00,449
that might stay open for a little while

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:04,060
but we'll keep the community poster

00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:07,509
are we still aiming for the 25th or with

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:11,289
that date change as well you know my my

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:13,030
take is that if we assume there's any

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:15,160
type of audience overlap between the

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,570
broader open source summit which would

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,470
go virtual as well because we're gonna

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:25,650
co-locate that sounds very hard to just

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:27,639
tack it on to the week but I don't know

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,259
we haven't figured that part out yet

00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,680
there that's a really good question and

00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:34,180
it's one of the top questions I've got

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,009
so we'll try to come up with a good

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,590
answer around them that respects

00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:41,699
everybody you know the effort it takes

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:45,909
to participate in something virtually

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:49,900
yeah the board members highlighted you

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:52,870
know a day with people on site like

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:56,289
seems feasible if they're on site but a

00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:59,139
whole day of content with people uh sigh

00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:04,830
seems less peaceable as far as keeping

00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:07,449
them engaged yeah absolutely

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,030
just one last thing on the content part

00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:11,440
I know we hear I think in one of the

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,330
previous caller calls me we're

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,820
discussing how to make sure that we

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,490
provide the context for the whole

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,979
innovations with kubernetes so one of

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,229
the first attempts that we did was kind

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,840
of like redoing the home page so I would

00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,759
love for it is very Huey and Troy in

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,320
particular but even the broader

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,820
community to take a look at that and

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,339
just see if that makes sense

00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,959
and then from there we I mean the home

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,419
page kind of make sense and from there

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,490
we are gonna have a little more detail

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:44,620
into how these different projects can

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:46,810
have played into that yeah I saw the

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:50,709
change that those three projects

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:53,230
highlighted quite well it looked great I

00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:54,430
think we need some cross references

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,279
between

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,560
for Cades and cube CF so people know

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,080
which is which when they land on one

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,690
page of the other yeah see I sort of a

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,040
see also sort of thing I'm working with

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:12,940
psy on that and I'll be working with the

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,459
docs team on something in the doc stop

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,440
Cloud Foundry org to point people in the

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:25,000
right direction if that's if that's how

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:28,740
they're discovering it did did we talk

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,890
about Paul taking the chairmanship and

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:36,459
Google joining any words about that yeah

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,660
I did mention Paul I think let's I

00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,760
skipped over that when I explained what

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:44,050
the board is but yeah yeah so Paul

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,520
Feig's own from VMware elected to chair

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:49,110
the board and again that's about the

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,110
business management of the corporation

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:57,300
John Rose who's the Dell Dell technology

00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,520
CTO has been doing that since 2015 and

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,920
so it seemed like a good good

00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,209
opportunity for him to to free up free

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,620
up some cycles he's off doing other

00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:10,510
things right now what was the other ones

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,180
right that was Paul and yeah Google

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,010
Google did upgrade so we have gentle

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,630
apps who works at Google's open source

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,570
office during the board to represent

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:22,360
Google excellent is that any indication

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:29,500
of maybe wider in falls meant from

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:34,630
Google engineers I would the way I would

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:40,209
say this is that you know Google's

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:43,060
recent focus on the enterprise has led

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,920
them to see that Cloud Foundry is very

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,540
important in the large enterprise to

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,930
quite a lot of these these big companies

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:52,920
and so demonstrating at least financial

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,570
support and it seems material to their

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,829
customer acquisition and retention

00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:04,089
strategy beyond that you know not sure

00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:05,740
okay I was I was just kind of hoping

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,350
that we can get some of the effort that

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,620
went into projects like KS in

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:14,020
in our kubernetes efforts sort of in

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,590
with the rest of us instead of being

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,960
surprised by them yeah I mean the

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,880
realities that every company is gonna

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,440
surprise the other companies whether

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,010
you're involved in the foundation or not

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,020
right

00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:29,830
it's just what it's what you all need to

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:34,600
do commercially you know III think the

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:38,230
answer to this is Troy the the the

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:42,580
continued push towards rapidly getting a

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,080
really robust set of options for for you

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,060
know a great debt experience in topic

00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,950
communities is something that Google is

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,940
paying a lot of attention to a lot of

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,850
companies are paying a lot of attention

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,040
to and so the more we we push on that

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,250
and the more we focus on ensuring that

00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,100
the you know the projects are prepared

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,440
for new contributors the more likely it

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:07,690
is that that diversity will continue to

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:10,900
grow cool okay Thanks so that we should

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,090
probably move on to that 18 minutes past

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,450
we should probably move on if there are

00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,380
no objections to PM cfb and actually we

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,120
have Eric here

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,690
yeah thanks Trey I'll run through these

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,520
real fast because we're pretty far in

00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:27,360
some highlights the release integration

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,440
team released version 0.1 of cf4 kate's

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,650
and they've also been working on

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,630
refining the change criteria for CF

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,000
deployment version 13

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:40,180
I know qcf has been integrating some of

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,470
the more kubernetes centric deployment

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,990
options for Iranian UAA into their set

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,640
of resources for deployment instead of

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,910
relying on the Marshall uses so that's

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,160
exciting to see that move forward to

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,380
supporting that CF ricketts version 0.1

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,510
release capi has completed that initial

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,210
integration with kpac trend cloud native

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:03,370
build packs prestiging tasks I think

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,590
they've been doing some work to

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,850
integrate their current stats D metrics

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:11,250
into something that's Prometheus

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,250
compatible with the law greener team and

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,300
one other thing I think that's

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,190
potentially exciting along that

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,370
kubernetes trajectory is that the

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,160
networking team has been working on more

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,279
deliberate

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,139
used to represent CF routes and they're

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,750
also moving forward with their

00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,639
exploration and work on supporting app

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,339
security groups via kubernetes

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:39,410
constructs such as network policy so

00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:41,480
there's a couple other items in the cab

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:51,800
agenda Journal but I think we can move

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:56,360
on from there okay excellent have we got

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:59,680
any one to represent Bosch you call I

00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,680
haven't looked at our attendee list

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:08,720
don't think so okay then I'll just

00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:11,300
mention quickly proxy some remarks from

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,930
the quarks team they've got release

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Florida 3.1 out and there's been a lot

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,519
of flux in the CF operator to

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,339
accommodate the changes in cube CF to

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,709
start consuming helm charts rather than

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:26,810
Basha releases or as in addition to

00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:30,319
Bosch releases so there are break some

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:32,750
breaking changes between the quarks

00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:35,569
operator and and cube CF state they're

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:41,360
they're now getting back in sync for

00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:45,110
that for the current releases anyone

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,630
from the Stratos team here Richard Cox

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:53,779
mentioned he might join Richard anything

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:55,430
to say about 3.1 or 3.0 yeah I can very

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,500
briefly took you through some of the

00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:02,560
features I condemning them as well if

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,339
you wish but I'm gonna in industry 200

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,660
which is rather the big thing for us

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,009
most of it was another hood but some of

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,100
the things that are visual to use is is

00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:11,779
the upgrade to angular 8 where we

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,059
basically the big thing there is

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:17,930
differential loading so which should

00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:19,129
improve Stratus in old browsers other

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,509
things we've done clarifying

00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:23,180
applications we can deploy those via

00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:25,939
docker image now along with public get

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,740
the gait lab or file archive those are

00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:29,990
the older ones but docker image is the

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,779
new one and users can view our foundry

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,900
events at the cloud foundry organ space

00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,640
level if you don't

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,040
you a as well now we have a quick way to

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,600
get Ron us up and running and where you

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,240
can specify some credentials for a

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,550
single user and that is your single user

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,800
is your admin for that that stratus

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,840
lifetime that's good for just testing oh

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,390
yeah if people just want to quickly demo

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,640
out what or see what it's about

00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:59,180
we've also improved error reporting so

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,070
now users can view specific errors in in

00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,080
the console and then kind of ignore

00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,970
those if they wish which removes all of

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,910
the kind of the warnings and that's also

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,770
good for demos and finally in in

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,660
three-door I know you are really

00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:16,370
complete without a dark mode so now

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:20,000
we've no hits jealous dark mode and in

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:21,410
3.1 which hasn't been released yet but

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,240
we've done an hour see today so

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,060
hopefully that'll be out within the next

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,820
week and in there we've basically made a

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,950
lot of improvements to scaling we've had

00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,410
some feedback from various users

00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,360
specifically Comcast they were talking a

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,540
lot about how they had a lot of entities

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,270
a lot of users of our logs so now in

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,930
we've improved the way the lists that we

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:48,350
have to present those we handle lots of

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:50,510
rocks identities and one of the big

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,420
things also fir the cloud gov team

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,580
they're interested in adding users we

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,670
already have the ability to invite users

00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,670
to organizations via email and that they

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,260
also wanted a way for all managers to

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:06,950
assign roles to people who were outside

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:09,800
of their organization this was gets a

00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,630
bit tricky for various reasons but we've

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,000
now added a way for basically anyone

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,520
with correct permissions to edit roles

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,230
via their username and so maybe if they

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,820
can't see them in the list we present

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,510
they can still change those roles again

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:25,490
if they have the permissions another

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,130
community feedback community one was a

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,830
we've disabled logging of jet stream API

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,960
requests optionally that could be a bit

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:35,450
spammy in the jet in our back-end log so

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,700
we can now disable those we've updated

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,160
the way that the Cloud Foundry deploy

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,500
works sort of sorry deploying

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,390
applications so that now supports all

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,140
the latest svey three features such as

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,790
multiple bill packs and a few small nice

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,940
ones we've support now the

00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:55,070
of Gravatar for user profile icons so if

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,580
enabled then then the user can see their

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,530
own their own icon in the top right and

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,630
finally we can edit endpoints so if you

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,060
if you put a typo in when you've added a

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:10,160
Cloud Foundry you can now edit that name

00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:11,690
I sent ya 3.1 of me out pretty cool we

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,510
don't actually have time for a toast

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:18,290
demo today so we're gonna go ahead we do

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:30,770
have to community project presentations

00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:32,870
lined up don't yet I think that isn't a

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,340
right map I mean we did we do present

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:38,900
logging in the old way if I remember the

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:41,840
way that looking is done okay I know at

00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:46,460
least the way it cemented for CF for

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,530
kids that it's in this new way as

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,140
opposed to the old way and so you want

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:55,060
you want you might not get logs if

00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,960
you're only doing it the old way yeah

00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,880
and I think it is in our roadmap

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,190
somewhere I'm not sure I'm wearing the

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:07,840
stack is but yeah it's currently the old

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:07,840
way thanks yes thanks for the heads up

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:18,850
the other only other extensions update

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:22,900
was a proposal for the CF backup plug-in

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:24,520
again that comes from Sousa follow the

00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:30,790
link in the agenda if you want to find

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:35,430
out more about that proposal I want to

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:39,910
leave us plenty of time for the projects

00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:43,270
presentations Steve are you ready to

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:55,690
present the other stuff about the CF f

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:57,280
tutorials that we okay okay thanks yes

00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,020
so Troy asked me to come in and just

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,510
talk about some of the work that we've

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,870
been doing behind the scenes to build up

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,310
a new tutorial site for kind of Cloud

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,520
Foundry and cloud foundry related

00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:11,740
tutorials so this is actually live now

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,380
hasn't officially been announced but

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,180
we're introducing it so that you all can

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,850
start kind of taking a look and poking

00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,310
and prodding at things so I will go

00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,960
through this relatively quickly and show

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:26,050
you kind of some of the I think

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,190
interesting parts but our goal here is

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:32,680
really to collect and curate a set of

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:36,760
tutorials that are kind of easily

00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,890
consumable you know short in nature for

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,510
various relevant audiences you know it

00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,090
doesn't really matter what the what the

00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,580
topics are but I think we do a great job

00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,950
of documenting the platform we've got

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,900
some very good long-form I think

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,550
training out there across different

00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,220
companies but I think in the community

00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:57,160
we could do better at introducing people

00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,450
that are kind of core concepts and doing

00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,210
some of those things quickly and that's

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,920
that's really what our aim is here so

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:07,570
you can start poking around at this it's

00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,730
out at tutorials Cloud Foundry org we'd

00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,230
been building some of the backend

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,540
infrastructure to support this and I'll

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,160
show you what some of that looks like

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,470
here in a second as well as some of the

00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,720
initial content but our goal here is

00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,370
really for people to get involved so if

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,150
you have ideas if you have thoughts if

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,310
you want to

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,200
you know make a quick tutorial 15-minute

00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:29,080
thing a ten-minute thing even you know

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,910
maybe up to about a thirty minute thing

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,460
on some particular topic that you think

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,450
would be relevant please jump in slack

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:39,880
in and touch let me know what that is

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,980
we're taking on the onus of maintaining

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:47,040
and making sure that all of those stuff

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:49,960
is is kept up to date and all that so

00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,540
I'll leave time for questions but just

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,280
to kind of give you an idea of what's in

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,950
here now and what's going to be in here

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,050
for launch in the next few weeks

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,430
currently there is not a section on what

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,530
is called foundry I'm working on that

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,780
behind the scenes but that will be here

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,250
for the launch and so we really want to

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,200
give people a good understanding a

00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,060
really quick review of what this thing

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,160
is and why it matters because they think

00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,350
we've seen over the course of the entire

00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,450
project that people just getting started

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,400
with cloud foundry is one of the biggest

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,170
impediments they just don't understand

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,750
how to start with it because there's so

00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,850
many different parts and pieces we are

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,980
addressing this whole you know question

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,350
of cloud foundry and kubernetes here

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,880
this is still actively being worked but

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:34,360
there is a draft that's out there that

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,780
you're welcome to take a look at for any

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,490
of any of you that have seen the Tri

00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,800
cloud foundry stuff that we put out

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:45,160
previously so try cloud foundry com

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,040
we've actually moved that in here in a

00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,770
tutorial format and it walks you through

00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,330
kind of getting a cloud foundry instance

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,910
or getting an account of an existing

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,730
cloud foundry instance and you know the

00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,260
basics are deploying and a half and you

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,150
know logging in and targeting that whole

00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,370
thing provisioning databases scaling

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:05,980
killing all that fun stuff

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:09,340
that is in here but we still felt that

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:11,260
that was a little bit of a too high of

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,670
an impediment because you got to go pick

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,440
a provider and then you got to figure

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,000
out how to actually get an account how

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,390
to sign up and all this other stuff

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,220
right and someone wanted to do is

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,100
actually make that a seamless process

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:28,020
and we ended up doing that on cata Kota

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:30,370
and so this is kind of no small feat

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,560
behind the scenes and this is I think

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,690
why why try ask me to come in and kind

00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,100
of show this initially but we've

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,020
implemented this on category

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,340
if you haven't used it before it is

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,690
basically an integrated learning

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,820
environment where we actually have a

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,740
real terminal window running over here

00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,910
and it's typically hooked up to live

00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:50,560
systems and so when you do cloudy coda

00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:52,150
training like if you were doing let's

00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,710
say some form of kubernetes training

00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:56,740
behind the scenes they'll typically spin

00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:00,430
up a mini cumin sense for you and hook

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,720
it up to your browser for us that model

00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,530
doesn't work great with Cloud Foundry

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,700
because the installs take a while so

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:10,110
what we ended up doing was actually

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:13,660
provisioning a cube CF cluster on GCP

00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:18,100
and basically hooking that up behind the

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:20,410
scenes and so it's the same tutorial but

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:25,420
when I actually start this tutorial I

00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:27,130
actually have Cloud Foundry instance I

00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,370
actually have an organ space I have a

00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:32,350
username I'm already authenticated and

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:36,400
everything is basically hooked up and

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:39,430
ready to go there are still some kind of

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,350
I don't know rough parts of katha coda I

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,850
don't know if you know the history but

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,680
they've been acquired by O'Reilly and

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,450
things have been getting better it's a

00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,070
really good platform but you know some

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,260
of these things are unfortunately things

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,720
we have to live with but the idea here

00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,480
is anybody can actually go through the

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,060
entire tutorial of actually using Cloud

00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,520
Foundry and pushing applications against

00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:05,730
the real running instance again it's

00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:08,410
running on cube CF right now the cube CF

00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,720
is relatively small we're waiting for

00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:13,750
the next release to basically update

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,460
behind the scenes and the way that this

00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,610
all works is you know essentially you

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,290
launch your cat a coda session we're

00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,090
making some calls out to an API that's

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,610
actually doing the provisioning behind

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:26,200
the scenes and after about 30 minutes

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,880
whatever that account is we'll

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,670
essentially just get destroyed and read

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,320
because we fully expect and understand

00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:35,350
that this keeps the F instances going to

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,640
get messed with and you know people are

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,470
going to poke at it and try to do

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,540
Bitcoin mining and all that fun stuff so

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,960
we've put some things in place to

00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:46,780
constantly repave and update URLs and

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,190
replace things but there's actually no

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,050
way for you to go in here and get the

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,480
username or to get the password

00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:54,550
sorry not the username to do anything

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,140
kind of major with this with this anyway

00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,550
but again it takes them through the

00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,390
whole process of deploying an

00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:02,740
application the binding services of

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,080
scaling the application killing the

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,030
application you know and that that whole

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,760
kind of try cloud foundry thing with

00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:14,380
basically no barrier of entry you just

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:16,630
need a browser that catagory works so

00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,840
that's primarily what I wanted to show

00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:23,710
you please do jump in and start looking

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,680
around and if you have ideas on content

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:29,500
you want to add you know please jump in

00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:32,380
slack there's a slack channel and and

00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,120
reach out to me and let me know we've

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,470
got kind of all the infrastructure stuff

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,790
behind the scenes so you don't need to

00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,320
worry about any of that you can

00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:41,560
basically just write some markdown and

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,070
we should be good to go so I will pause

00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:49,120
there that's incredible Steve thank you

00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:54,550
so much we're gonna do a big push on

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:58,020
this from the DF website yeah yeah ship

00:26:54,550 --> 00:27:03,220
and end of April awesome

00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:05,350
the the next demo is what we're gonna

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,110
focus on next week and then the week

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:13,900
after we'll give tutorials that's the

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:19,740
workout we're doing Steve this for any

00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:26,980
of our more engaged like operators like

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:28,480
Comcast fidelity okay if if they'd be

00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,340
good people they can give you feedback

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,500
on if this made sense in their

00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,140
organization to make it easier to try it

00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:40,930
out

00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:42,490
sure yeah that's good idea I think a lot

00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:44,890
of what you'll find here that's in there

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,930
now is really aimed at the getting

00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:50,170
started type stuff so it might not be

00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:52,570
relevant for them but we wanted to

00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,670
really kind of tackle the barrier of

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:57,840
entry issue that I think we hear about

00:27:54,670 --> 00:28:00,370
on Twitter a lot so oh and incidentally

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,080
the intention is also to offer this

00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,610
whole try Cloud Foundry experience on

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,679
Stratos

00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:08,380
because I actually do work on the cloud

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,150
backup team part-time as well and we

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,770
have a lot of users that just do

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,590
everything through the UI and we want to

00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:19,179
support that as well so cool so it's

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:20,440
coming also feel free to if there are

00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,390
people that you think would be valuable

00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:27,850
and feedback please definitely share the

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:29,890
information thanks Alan the other thing

00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,660
I just reiterate and it's Steve already

00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,330
said but I'm gonna make a really

00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:37,929
specific reiteration here this is an

00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:39,910
awesome opportunity for projects to

00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:42,309
think about not just like the formal

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,960
documentation side but if you've got a

00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:46,150
really cool new feature a quick tutorial

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:50,169
might be a great idea it's a different

00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:52,630
format right it's lighter weight so you

00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,910
know there's there's been a limited

00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,790
number of people that have contributed

00:28:53,910 --> 00:29:00,669
but it's on github right so PR is

00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:02,049
welcome please you know consider that as

00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:06,549
you're thinking about your project teams

00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:11,020
and and you know sigh as the CF for

00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:14,260
Kate's continues to evolve right getting

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:16,140
some input into that one tutorial that

00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:19,840
tries to talk about CF and and

00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,490
kubernetes and how the two relate you

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,290
know let's let's keep this thing in mind

00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,650
so you know CF for Kate's is

00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:29,530
well-represented - yeah I just took some

00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,840
notes down I Steve I think I this is the

00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,370
first time I've seen you so thank this

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,040
is a great demo so I've just started

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,900
writing down who to talk to you and how

00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:43,929
do I reach out and how can we use that

00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:45,610
tutorial so yeah that'd be great there

00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:48,660
there is a mention of C uppercase and

00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:52,390
keep C F in there but again you know

00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,530
we're open to whatever you know if you

00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,580
have thoughts if you have things you

00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,500
want to add if you want to add a

00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:00,910
separate section on C F for kids that's

00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,540
perfectly fine too for everybody that's

00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,730
what we're here for

00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,610
yeah I'm thinking of the C F for Kate

00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,530
Smith is cube C F is not as relevant

00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:13,450
here because the the user experience

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:15,640
should be the same so you think the

00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,080
operators section maybe makes it oh yeah

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,990
that makes yeah so

00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,510
err also these sections are you know

00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,210
just what we put in here so far so we

00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,660
can we can change this however you want

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:30,190
yeah I definitely see two sort of

00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,170
sections one for the operator experience

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,580
just like how Docs has divided the

00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,980
operator experience in app developer

00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,260
experience you know and so if you're an

00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,330
operator go here and think about some of

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,540
the what you need to do and then the

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:49,240
other one is the actual app developer

00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:51,610
experience could someone drop a link to

00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,950
the github repo in the chat so we can

00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:56,680
put it over in the I'll copy it over

00:30:53,950 --> 00:31:06,040
into there all right or directly into

00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:07,890
the agenda under though there we go any

00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:15,240
more questions for Steve

00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:18,310
thank you Steve yeah thanks ray catch up

00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:22,810
can you tell us what you're doing with

00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:24,370
Bill pecks yes thanks Trey first off for

00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,980
those of you that don't know me I'm

00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:30,340
Kashia the product management manager at

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:32,800
VMware on the build path site we wanted

00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,040
to just take some time to announce the

00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,390
potato build packs project launch to you

00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,880
folks I don't have too much like

00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,860
official content prepared maybe just

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,720
walk you through the brand-new website

00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:48,100
that the cff put together and then

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,850
answer some questions so first off Kato

00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,090
build packs

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:54,970
we're just launching this product as a

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:57,850
collection of our implementations of

00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,130
cloud native build packs a huge

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,290
motivation behind this launch is sort of

00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,540
tying to a lot of messaging that chip

00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:07,570
said a little earlier around expanding a

00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:09,790
little bit more broadly beyond just the

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:12,400
Cloud Foundry a community as we expanded

00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,020
into kubernetes and all and the overall

00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,180
messaging I think we want to get forward

00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,760
with this launch is just that build

00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,370
packs are not just for Cloud Foundry but

00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,960
for everyone beyond and using any cloud

00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:28,540
native platform we're planning on

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,700
launching sometime next week likely next

00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,399
Tuesday but we have an FAQ attached

00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:36,669
to the agenda doc that I can keep

00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:39,519
updated as we go let me share my screen

00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:49,409
real fast and I could just show you all

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:52,119
the brand new site that we have created

00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:55,359
so I put the FAQ together yesterday and

00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:59,440
the CFF really polished up the site and

00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:01,059
I'm really liking how it looks now so as

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,690
soon as we launch we're gonna be

00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:05,919
supporting

00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:08,799
java.net core go nodejs nginx and PHP

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,139
language families in the FAQ we're

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,119
planning on like adding in roadmap

00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:16,440
things like that over the next couple

00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,440
weeks as soon as we launch

00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:22,169
yeah that's effectively all I had uh

00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:26,639
maybe we could pause here and just

00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:26,639
answer some questions around this

00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:38,880
I have one I hope it's not controversial

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:41,340
might be a complicated explanation why

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,529
are we not doing this under the build

00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:48,240
packs site and brand I mean it looks

00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:52,620
great and I'm very happy to have it and

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:55,799
I just was wondering why that isn't

00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,299
happening under that umbrella totally

00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,940
yeah that's a great question actually

00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:02,880
like I think the biggest question anyone

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,039
has had so far we have like I think the

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,559
build packs project is a part of the CNC

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,990
f itself and their whole goal and job is

00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:13,200
just to build out the overall cloud

00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:14,940
native build packs specification the

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,659
picado build packs project is just

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,750
focused more so on implementing build

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,859
packs that conform to that specification

00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,780
we're a little lucky here because we

00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:29,070
have Stephen who's also like a core

00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:30,780
maintainer of both the CNCs build packs

00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:34,740
project cloud native build packs project

00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:37,109
and also the potato side so a huge part

00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:39,780
of I think the website content FAQ

00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:42,270
things like that or more so message to

00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,470
around sort of differentiating the two

00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:46,530
because that's a big question we've had

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:48,810
okay that totally makes sense because I

00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:51,389
was sort of waiting to see some

00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,460
implementations from Bill Paxton IO for

00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:56,879
a while like where do you find them I

00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,160
can see the spec this this makes sense

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,720
to me now

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,180
well the build packs IO project if you

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,310
have the PAC CLI locally and run pack

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,310
suggest builders it gives you a list of

00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:09,540
different kind of open-source build

00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,580
packs that are out there from

00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,990
contributors to the project's lists the

00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,540
CI build packs which will say potato

00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,070
dough packs and it also lists for

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,589
Okaloosa edible packs for cognitive

00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:22,500
impacts so the the project may do some

00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:24,300
curation and and more visibility around

00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,530
build packs that are out there but it's

00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:30,180
kind of a goal of that project not to

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,160
you know say these build packs are

00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,960
better than is right it's about just

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,310
about the specification and tooling and

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,619
making sure that's really easy for

00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:42,540
platforms any platform to support in

00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:45,330
bill impacts um it's also worth I think

00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,609
noting that with potato we really want

00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:51,359
to double down on that kind of vendor

00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:53,310
neutrality and you know kind of there's

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,170
a bull fair governance and all of those

00:35:53,310 --> 00:36:00,599
things you know that we really want to

00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:01,650
turn the potato project into a you know

00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,750
something with a much larger community

00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,849
than what Cloud Foundry build PACs

00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,130
hadn't passed I think our experiences in

00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:09,960
the C&C F with cloud native build packs

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,420
and participating would sort of a lot

00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,230
more companies they're really sort of

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,230
informed that outlook

00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:22,220
yeah because I think your team Stephen

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,110
has shouldered all of the Cloud Foundry

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,880
buildpack work over the over the years

00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:28,240
and I'd be good to get some assistance

00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,240
here

00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,880
you

00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:40,650
well after hurrying through all these

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,350
now we have time any other open

00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:46,740
questions anyone have anything else they

00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:50,750
want to share it Stefan speaking I have

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:54,210
one question regarding bill pecks

00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:57,090
do you have a plans or ideas how is this

00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:59,580
new word of cncs bill pecks could also

00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:04,110
be made available in traditional CF

00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:06,210
deployment foundations so Capek that's

00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:13,770
integrated into copy so as are some ways

00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:15,630
ideas plans I can take this one so the K

00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:18,180
PAC is being integrated into CF for

00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:20,520
Kate's and so it'll be the way that CF

00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,100
for Kate's does build pack builds in the

00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,230
future something else we're doing to

00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,820
make sure that exists existing

00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,760
deployments and people who can upgrade

00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,200
you know to run CF on top of kubernetes

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,700
yet something else we're going to make

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,800
sure that they're very well supported is

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,600
we're producing this this will still

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,940
probably be Cloud Foundry branded

00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,550
instead of potato branded but we're

00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,020
we're producing sort of shim versions of

00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,060
the new build packs that will continue

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:48,180
to run our foundations to make sure

00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,410
people know keep receiving bill peck

00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,170
updates and we don't end up maintaining

00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,550
two generations of build packs so while

00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:56,040
the potato build packs were like really

00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,690
modular and kind of fit the new API like

00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,960
for instance the node build pack is like

00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:03,900
no didn't yarn yarn install and NPM and

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,700
all these little parts will we'll be

00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,110
releasing a Cloud Foundry compatible

00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,810
build pack that kind of wraps all those

00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:12,570
together along with the v3 tooling and

00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:15,120
runs it on top of the b2 tooling on

00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:18,030
Cloud Foundry it's a surprise we could

00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,650
make that work but the it won't have

00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,270
some of the performance benefits as if

00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,520
you're running on top of a proper cloud

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:26,730
medical tax platform like Kay pack or it

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,890
packs you lie or whatnot but it should

00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,750
bring a lot of the new functionality and

00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,070
features and sort of transparency of the

00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,660
new build pack model back to Cloud

00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,470
Foundry it's so existing Cloud Foundry

00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:40,280
users should see some benefit there -

00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:42,480
thank you yes so it's awesome and and

00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,480
you mentioned the performance aspect

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,070
here the staging is typically a lot

00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,950
faster with cloud native build packs

00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:51,260
correct much faster they're like there's

00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:54,360
some some app

00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,220
especially on rebuilds take a second or

00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,200
two seconds even if the build pack has

00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,240
to start a container and run due to the

00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,890
really aggressive layer we use again

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,810
those those performance benefits won't

00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,310
show up when you're running the chemin

00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,660
versions on Cloud Foundry but it will

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,700
show up when you're running with kpac

00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,020
integrated the CF for Kate's or on any

00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,020
other platform that supports cloud

00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:15,150
minute build packs yeah and I know this

00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:18,120
is in the cube CF roadmap it's just not

00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:21,350
gonna appear as soon as it as it has in

00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:24,210
in CF 4k eights I think it's there now

00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,310
side does this mean that these bill

00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:30,390
pecks we just saw on the website are

00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:34,080
going to be in CF for Kade's yes so

00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,850
right now we have a one big builder good

00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,790
that contains all of this bill packs the

00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:42,080
plan is to work with the Cappy team and

00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:46,790
the Decatur bill paxton to have more

00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:51,060
granular set of bill packs configure or

00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:52,620
declared indicia for Kade's resources so

00:39:51,060 --> 00:40:01,350
you will individually see each of this

00:39:52,620 --> 00:40:05,030
bill packs cool any other questions

00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:05,030
about anything we've covered today

00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:14,560
it's um I was just going to as Steven if

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,500
for the faster rebuilding times and that

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:24,210
was with container D versus doctor based

00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:26,140
case yes that's this is complicated the

00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,970
what I was referencing before is just

00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,430
the rebuild time which doesn't the

00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:33,040
container runtime doesn't affect just

00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:36,240
the process of generating a new image if

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:39,310
you're deploying you know applications

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,830
the container runtime contain if you're

00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:44,830
running just container D versus you know

00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:49,060
running into dr. Damon the doctor Damon

00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:52,840
is bad at pulling a you know like it'll

00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:55,840
repulse entire sometimes if if the sort

00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,550
of lower layers have changed but the you

00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,750
know layers above them haven't changed

00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,370
and the cloud native built acts API

00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,260
relies on very fine updating and

00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,640
individual layers in the registry and so

00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,090
if you do a deployment with docker

00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,160
especially at scale after a stack update

00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:11,080
if you're using a you know Kate's that

00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,120
has a docker Damon on it and uses that

00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,200
to pull images then there's there's a

00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,610
little bit of a performance hit

00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,280
depending on the kind of operation you

00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:20,170
did so that you know one or two seconds

00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,510
is is just just talking about the

00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:24,310
rebuild time deploy should be very fast

00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,750
on a platform with container D because

00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:28,150
only the change layers will get

00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,130
transferred that you know node VM in the

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,440
case of a stack update only the change

00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,600
layers for all the you know containers

00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,710
on the you know node be it will get

00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,030
transferred there and everything can I

00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,680
flip around but if you're running a

00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:41,140
doctor damn and there are definitely

00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,250
cases where things are a lot more data

00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:47,560
has to be pulled the and we don't

00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,720
foresee docker making any changes to

00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,330
that so as as Cades platforms move

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,670
towards container d the deployment part

00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:57,240
of that sort of build into play process

00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,240
will be faster

00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:05,080
let's do a short yeah sorry in short run

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,080
on container d if you can it's better

00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,080
yes

00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,850
okay

00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,820
think we got through everything in

00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:23,110
record time thanks everyone who

00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:28,090
presented today and thanks for all your

00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:32,100
questions for being here and I will see

00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:32,100
you all again in two weeks

00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:38,420
