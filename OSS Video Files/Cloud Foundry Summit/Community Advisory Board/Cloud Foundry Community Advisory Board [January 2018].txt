Hot Swap

Makes swapping hot and fun again!

Touching some of the internals of the director so are being careful and adding tests to backfill if anything is missing.

CAn read more about this on BOSH notes.

In addition to helping to spin up some of the deployments will help to unblock some of the future changes to the director where will improve diffing such that diffing will show what will change persistent disk / vms / etc…

Eventually will unblock granular deploy, which will allow to be much more exact in not having to update any other instance having to specify on command line.

Ask in slack channel if curious.
