hello and welcome to the trek polyglot

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,429
in memory my name is Jana Rita I'm

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,700
heading a product management team enviro

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,530
for the ASAP cloud platform and i would

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,240
like to take the next ten minutes to

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,250
give you at least my interpretation of

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,199
this quite diverse

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,650
track called polyglot in memory

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,510
applications and yep what we can

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,760
understand out of that before we then

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:32,669
kick off the agenda with the detailed

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:35,070
sessions so what is polyglot 'memory let

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,540
me start with polyglot probably the

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,640
closest interpretation that of course

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,030
you can have of this title is speaking

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,070
multiple languages like like a polyglot

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,809
person who travels the world and can

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,899
locally speak the languages that are

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,610
needed in their acording regions so of

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,800
course multi-language support for a

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,530
platform as a service offering is pretty

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,239
key in order to enable developers to use

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,520
the language that first of all they

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,500
speak and secondly that's youth the

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,989
current use case that they would like to

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,299
implement however what we've seen within

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,890
enterprise applications of course that

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,320
there's different needs around the

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,570
languages that should be supported so at

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,880
least a lot of si P customers ask for

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,619
enterprise support meaning if they

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,299
choose a certain language in order to

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,820
develop their enterprise applications

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,240
they expect to be able to closely work

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,040
with si P in order to fix problems get

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,650
response for questions and if there is

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,479
issues that we can resolve those and

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,729
bring those back in to the platform and

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,439
as you could imagine that of course is

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,150
something you can't do for 50 or 60

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,100
languages and runtimes

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,320
that's always a limited but still

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,170
growing set of languages that we can

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,820
support on this level nevertheless of

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,100
course there's a need from the community

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,799
and from the developers to be open for

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,840
some more languages and of course using

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,820
cloud foundry we can use the community

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,729
Bill pegs offered by cloud foundry in

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,380
order to ensure this openness or if you

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,299
even have some more needs not yet

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,430
fulfilled by the cloud foundry community

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,729
and Bill pecs you have the option to

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,829
bring your own build packs well but

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,649
language of course is one of the things

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,690
being polyglot but if you travel the

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,860
world and have applications developed in

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,360
different languages

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,760
of course you don't want them to be

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,070
isolated but be able to connect to the

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,980
rest of the world so to be able to

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,570
integrate and connect to other

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,760
applications out there and of course

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,100
having properly defined interfaces and

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,400
api's to have the applications working

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,110
together is one of the means however

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
what we see quite frequently is of

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,250
course that many of our customers still

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,200
have a huge on-premise footprint and

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,720
that will probably remain for the next

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,090
decade that a lot of course systems that

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,600
you would like to connect to your cloud

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,730
applications are on-premise and enabling

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,270
a connectivity and means to hook up

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,650
those systems in a secure manner and

00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,380
allowing connections between the cloud

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,030
applications of course is key so within

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,670
sfv we have developed a technology

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,280
called sa P cloud connector that enables

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,200
you to have an agent on-premise that

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,840
hooks then up to your cloud applications

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,550
and to your accounts and cloud

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,920
connectivity of course is similarly

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,590
important because many applications that

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,780
you do develop are actually extending or

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,760
connecting to other cloud applications

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,220
that you would like to seamlessly hook

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,120
up with and have single sign-on similar

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,860
theming and so on enabled an integration

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,690
can of course be more than that so

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,220
process integration plays an important

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,410
role as well if you have certain

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,260
applications that actually are Web

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,480
Services or any other api's that require

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,239
a certain level of mediation and

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,070
translation in between and data

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,230
integration could be quite a need as

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,480
well if you say you want to develop more

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,430
analytics focused applications that

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,500
first of all should gather some data

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,840
from different sources bring them

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,060
together and join them and then create

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,980
some analytic centric as applications on

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,959
top so the different levels of

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,239
integration of course are key as a

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,000
capability of a platform as a service in

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:11,130
order to enable to be truly global and

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,930
polyglot and lastly of course usually as

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,730
a developer and as an enterprise you're

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,620
not just picky about the language that

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,859
you want to develop the application in

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,419
but where this is running so we see with

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,970
a lot of customers and partners that

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,919
they do of course have trusted vendors

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,270
in terms of infrastructure as a service

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,099
and in many

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,470
cases there is a need to bring the

00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:33,419
applications that you develop close to

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,650
where the rest of your applications and

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,229
solutions are reside

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,569
so really implementing a truly multi

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:42,090
cloud deployment of cloud foundry and

00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,770
other platform as a service environment

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,889
is very important as well to be

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,960
available on AWS as your Google cloud

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,900
platform and of course in our case and s

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,090
AP data centers so that allows you then

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,789
to not only choose the language of

00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,430
choice but to choose the environment and

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:01,289
the region of choice as well where then

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:05,880
the applications should reside and

00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:07,770
connect to the rest of the world ok so

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,190
far at least for my interpretation of

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,650
polyglot so what's in memory then well

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,210
usually developing is not just about

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,039
picking a certain language and

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,860
developing the application but you need

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,759
some supporting services around that

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,120
classically of course in cloud foundry

00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,129
the packing services that in many cases

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,020
are a database where you would like to

00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:30,509
store the relevant data that is

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,280
important for your application of course

00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:36,180
in the database and technology of choice

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,740
biet MongoDB Post Klee and so on or it

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,389
could be other backing services that

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,110
allow you to have a caching mechanism

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:45,719
enabled the specialty that we add with

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,610
the in-memory aspect is that we offer as

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:50,400
ap HANA as a backing service and

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,349
database within a cloud platform as well

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,870
and within the Cloud Foundry environment

00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:57,779
so s AP HANA really gives you the

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,940
ability to process data in memory and to

00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,279
persisted in memory and to have large

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,680
data sets that you can then work real

00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,990
time on bead on the one inside for

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,330
application logic or of course for

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:13,650
analytics cases to enable your business

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,539
to get instant insights and s AP HANA is

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,580
more than just the database it provides

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,710
some advanced data processing means as

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,539
well that allow you to really use some

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,849
libraries that give you geospatial

00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:27,419
functionality predictive functionality

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:29,729
and so on one specific approach about

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,520
this with sa P Hana we even brought a

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,139
lightweight Cloud Foundry set on-premise

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,839
so you can use something like Hana

00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:39,060
Express deployed as locally on your PC

00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,889
develop your applications and at a

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,560
certain point in time then

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:47,300
to have this application deployed to

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,550
Cloud Foundry and be enabled there and

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,550
of course large data sets in a growing

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,680
world are not enough so the space of big

00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,590
data is emerging and is emerging for us

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,020
as I say P as well our answer to this in

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,550
many extensions si P Bora where we

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,490
really want to leverage an in-memory

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:08,099
distributed computing environment in

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:12,780
order to really analyze huge data sets

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:15,090
behind the scenes good so but it's not

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,000
only about polyglot and about in-memory

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,979
but in the end it's of course about the

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,180
application that you want to develop at

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:26,699
the end of the day so not a big surprise

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,069
of course a Cloud Foundry we encourage

00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,990
our customers and partners and our

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,449
internal groups to develop micro

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,400
services and follow the 12 factor design

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,680
principles in order to really develop

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,439
nice applications that scale well that

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,719
isolate well and that can be changed

00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,789
over time in very agile manners

00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:47,219
because of course one of the main

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,949
drivers to go to the cloud actually is

00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:51,719
to be able to agile react on

00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:53,879
requirements and on changing conditions

00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:57,419
and to be able to implement those

00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,400
changes very quickly and as just said of

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,319
course that is true on multiple levels

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,440
it's on the one inside the business

00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,779
applications that you create on top the

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,569
customers partners and si P creates on

00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,550
top its business services as well so

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:14,189
your reusable entities that provide

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,770
business logic down to technical

00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:19,020
services such as blockchain machine

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,969
learning Internet of Things that are

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,099
developed in a microservices fashion as

00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:25,620
well to individually grow over time

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:30,360
without dependencies on the other

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:32,430
services one thing that we see quite

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,610
frequently in this area is of course a

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:38,190
need for UI and mobile first so that's

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,990
one of the main drivers that we see from

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,269
customers and partners that of course

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,640
functionality is important but in many

00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:46,920
cases people are very picky on the user

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,199
interface and to be able to quickly

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,839
generate user interfaces and to test

00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:53,790
that with your target audience so having

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,260
tools that allow you to enable rapid

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,390
products

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,460
typing rapid development based on

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,650
templates is one of the key features of

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,080
a platform as a service offering - and

00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:06,410
of course whatever you create should be

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,720
suitable and cater multiple devices that

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,670
are out there so not just laptops but of

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,940
course mobile devices at the end of the

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,980
day - some common needs are on the one

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,380
hand side whatever you create to create

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,300
this with a unified look and feel so

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,400
that for the end users it's not visible

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,590
that it's multiple micro-services living

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,840
somewhere but it's one unified user

00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,850
experience but still that needs to be

00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,370
flexible to be able to incorporate

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,760
custom design guidelines and corporate

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:37,730
theming and all with the goal to put the

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,770
user first right so of course as much as

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,230
we love technology and databases and so

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,760
on the basic idea is that we want to

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,220
fulfill the needs of the line of

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,710
business and the users and to be able to

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,930
react quickly on those needs and

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,630
typically to start with co-innovation

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,270
and Design Thinking principles before

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,280
actually deciding then which language

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,490
and which backing service is supporting

00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:04,310
this need best so as you've seen

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,950
hopefully the polyglot in memory of

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,750
course is giving you a lot of options on

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,540
how to interpret what we want to talk

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,790
about and that is of course reflected in

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,100
the agenda that you see for today and

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,750
tomorrow and with that I don't want to

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,150
take you through all the individual

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,310
sessions but just hope that you have a

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,900
great time here and enjoy the sessions

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,060
and the different topics you're going to

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,160
face

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,160
