Title: Breathe Into the Node.js
Publication date: 2017-06-22
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Silicon Valley 2017
Description: 
	Breathe Into the Node.js [B] - Mark Hinkle, Linux Foundation   

Node.js is becoming increasingly more popular with 7 million users per month and growing at a rate of 100% year-over-year. Although the application platform is attracting a lot of new developers, it is also attracting Java, Ruby and Python developers, especially as more enterprises explore microservices. 

Node.js is a dynamically typed language and if you are trying to approach this application platform like Java, Ruby and Python, you are bound to fail.

This presentation will provide an overview of why Node.js is the right choice for PaaS and how best to approach this language if you are a traditional Java, Ruby or Python developer.

hmm title of my talk is breathe into the

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,680
node which is interesting because this

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,660
predates me so I'm not sure if we can

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,160
really breathe into the node J s but

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,349
we're gonna talk a little bit about what

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,570
we do and why it's cool and why you

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,029
should be interested so I think most of

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,500
you raised your hands and already are

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,000
doing things with nodes so we'll talk a

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,890
little bit about the the foundation the

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,230
project where we're heading and what

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,789
people are doing with node and give you

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,250
an idea the State of the Union and then

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,180
we'll let the smart people talk for the

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:40,829
rest of the two days as I said I'm mark

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,870
Hinkel I have slowly moved up the stack

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,329
I started out in the internet support in

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,670
the 90s and I think I've hit every layer

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,500
and now I'm back all the way at the top

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,850
in the app space which is sort of cool

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,910
for me I am an open source guy too so

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,410
I've spent the last 20 years or so

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,660
working in to have been sourced so I'm

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,000
an Apache committer on a patchy cloud

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,619
stack I've spent a lot of time building

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,290
it the source communities since pretty

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:13,110
important to me so nodes seem like a

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:16,439
little was a good fit so real quickly my

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,119
nodes story the reason I decided to get

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,409
involved with notice before this I was

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,720
the vp of marketing to the Linux

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,119
Foundation the Linux Foundation provides

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,850
governance for all sorts of projects

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:31,740
including Linux cloud foundry a lot of

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,340
networking projects like open Dave later

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,770
than nfe and I didn't know a lot about

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,450
nodes so I went to node interactive

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,799
which is the annual node conference last

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,149
fall and just wanted to see what what

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,729
was going on there so I could help

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,790
better market it and what I saw was

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,820
pretty exciting it was probably the most

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,520
impassioned community of developers I'd

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,500
seen in quite some time

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,920
there was really cool things going on

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,899
and the usage was amazing and it was

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,439
sort of puzzling to me because back in

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,479
the 90s I was a tech support rep and we

00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,890
did JavaScript support which just

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,980
animated menus and didn't do very

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,050
interesting things and now people are

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,680
writing full stack applications in

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:23,920
JavaScript with the help of MIT and its

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,890
progressed quite a bit so I was I was

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,540
really excited about the conference I

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,030
walked out in the street at Austin and

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,610
called my boss who's the head of the

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,650
Linux Foundation and I said this

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,930
marketing gig is cool and all but I

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,580
really want to work when they j/s he's a

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,610
really hand I'm like yeah really there's

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:45,610
there's something here so that's started

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,230
a process of me getting to where I am

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:51,910
today which is running the new j/s

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:54,790
foundation I'm very lucky to be here so

00:02:51,910 --> 00:03:00,250
the five W's of node the who what why

00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:02,680
when where the nodejs is now governed

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,720
Anna foundation the nodejs Foundation

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,280
which is is supported by the Linux

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,450
Foundation it's very similar the way

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,470
cloud foundry is governed I think we all

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,530
know what nodejs

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:18,700
is and from what you said you're all

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:22,019
pretty much engaged it's very cool

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,100
because now that we can do end-to-end

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,130
JavaScript development for full stack

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,739
applications it does expand the the

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:36,100
usefulness of JavaScript via the chrome

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:37,690
v8 engine and since 2009 we've grown

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,880
quite a bit so it was developed

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,459
initially at a company called giant by a

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,530
guy named Brian Dahl and now we have

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,330
over 8 million installations worldwide

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,610
and we know that because people are

00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:53,019
calling him for downloading their NPM

00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:55,989
packages through for NIM and we're at

00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:59,650
new JSC org so that's the high overview

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:02,410
of node let's talk a little bit about

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,150
cloud foundry so when I was looking to

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,310
come to the summit I wanted to see what

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,260
they said about cloud foundry so it

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,120
makes developers lives easier sort of

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,930
their culantro that gives you speed and

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,930
control and it's backed by the industry

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,079
heavyweights like IBM and others pivotal

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,519
etc

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,120
so that's the border what do we say

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,060
about node and it's about developer ease

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,220
speed and control and backed by industry

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,789
heavyweights so I said ah we probably

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,699
get along pretty good so I think your

00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:37,620
chocolate fell in our peanut butter and

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,879
actually somebody told me that they had

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,500
no idea what that meant and then I

00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,690
realized that I was old but that's the

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,379
old Reese's Peanut Butter Cup commercial

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,389
from the 80s so if you remember it

00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:52,259
you're not old you're just nostalgic

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:54,810
that's what I told them and if you don't

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:58,849
remember it it's a delicious combo that

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:02,759
we should all work gobble up every time

00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:06,030
so one of the other things that I hear

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,759
when I hear Cloud Foundry is there a

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,770
polygon so you they have build packs for

00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,289
all these different languages it

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:17,009
provides that's that control and that

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:19,139
deployment and that automation for for

00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:21,479
applications but what I'm gonna talk

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,360
about mostly today is just one of those

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:29,430
and that's JavaScript and so if you look

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,949
at the stack overflow did their annual

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,250
survey with over 64,000 developers this

00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:37,740
year the number one language that they

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,650
talked about was JavaScript which back

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,940
to my original story it's amazing that

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,620
20-some years later in my career I'm

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,159
still talking about JavaScript and is

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,020
still growing but it is for various

00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:53,729
reasons one of them is I'd like to think

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:56,340
is the advances of things like no how

00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:00,569
many people here consider themselves a

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,219
Java developer okay how many people also

00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:06,569
consider themselves a JavaScript

00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:08,699
developer how many people are seeing

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:12,180
easing more JavaScript and less Java

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:14,069
these days I'm just curious and actually

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,729
I don't have a preference I'm just it's

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,960
it's just fascinating to me that that's

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:21,029
with all the frameworks that are out

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,150
there and the ecosystem expanding things

00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:25,710
like angular react and other development

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,440
frameworks and things like know that

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,480
that this is becoming a

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,980
excepted platform for enterprise

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:38,310
application development just a little

00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:43,290
bit more on that last week red Munk the

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:45,090
analyst firm released their analysis the

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,060
most talked about programming languages

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,040
and they took data from Stack Overflow

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,900
cross-referenced it with github and once

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,650
again JavaScript was at the top of the

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,080
list so it there is a movement and an

00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,880
expansion of JavaScript development on

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,020
top of the other things I mean Java and

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,840
Python and c-sharp and all these other

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,430
languages are fine it's just there is a

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,810
growing ecosystem and there are a lot of

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,360
opportunities to develop applications

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:20,940
with this frameworks and tools that

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,770
weren't there ten years ago this year

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,200
and this is the first time this data is

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,980
being seen in the wild but we did a

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,870
survey of the nodejs

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,810
community and a lot of these graphs

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,780
where you see a source as a q4 and cute

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,640
32 and such that's from the community

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,670
the node.js community so it's a really

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:46,020
good representative sample of what we do

00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:47,280
and what our users are doing see you

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,870
know where we're going but in the last

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,960
last 12 months as you would expect

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:56,250
javascript is the top of our list

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:59,790
there's some versioning for the language

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:02,040
version from the last six months of 2016

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:05,550
as well but javascript as you'd expect

00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,750
is at the top of the list here's the

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,300
thing that I think is really interesting

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:14,970
is that the growth that we see is

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:19,830
JavaScript we also see go as an emerging

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:22,560
language swift Scala Python you also in

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,300
the gray you can see where where the our

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,230
users are telling us they're decreasing

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:31,440
usage so you see that a lot of people

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,870
are hard just moving into JavaScript and

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,250
node and not decreasing their usage at

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,060
all some of the things that are

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:41,000
declining or PHP in a sample size for

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:48,320
this I believe was like 1300s

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,910
it's not a small sample and here's some

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,880
of the things that we're seeing the

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,970
development of node in is Web Apps and

00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:02,690
enterprise big data and embedded systems

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:07,190
especially IOT I think it's it's telling

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:09,320
that that the node is a moving into the

00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,840
enterprise because before you know ten

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,190
years ago and then what would you said

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,680
you're developing your enterprise apps

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,780
and Java what else would you do it I'm

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,340
not risking it may be net but

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,750
Java's is ruling the roost but

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:31,130
javascript is becoming an enterprise app

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:34,730
development platform here's some of the

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:38,180
things that we see affinity with some

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:43,220
things I I will say that they may be as

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:45,260
far as relevance maybe more interesting

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,170
than others III think that obviously you

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,580
would expect nodejs frameworks to be

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,020
something that we work with but

00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,540
containers

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,420
almost 50 percent of our users are

00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:59,510
deploying node in containers databases

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:02,510
obviously MongoDB there's something we

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:07,310
call the mean stack no no to

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:10,640
express angular and node as a full stack

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:13,520
development stack we see a lot of people

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,940
that are front ending with load

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,940
balancing like nginx etc and then

00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,650
messaging systems obviously see I I

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,600
think that CI thing is funny to me

00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,630
because I've been in a development space

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,550
that perhaps maybe everybody should be

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:31,370
using continuous integration and only

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,410
not just 49% but I think maybe that

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,790
might have been in the way the question

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:39,710
was phrased there's also the the

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,910
framework the front-end frameworks is

00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,430
another thing I'm going to harp on a

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:47,420
little bit is with things like react and

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:49,730
angular and electron you have really

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,470
good tools to develop applications that

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,150
you can get up to speed with really

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,760
quickly I think that's one of the

00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,540
attraction

00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:01,470
no diz is just time to to value is

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,270
really short being a tech guy in the

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,210
early days everything was about the best

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:08,160
like I need the best so I was spending

00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,130
all that money for solaris servers back

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,900
in the 90s and you know then linux was

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,800
good enough and we started using Linux

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:20,100
now utility and and speed is are ways

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,070
that we measure IT returned various in

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,860
my early early days I had metrics around

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,180
uptime now you have people like Amazon

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,680
they're like well we might be down for

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,380
30 seconds but we'll get all these

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,870
updates up a month sooner than waiting

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,910
till a maintenance windows so so the

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,160
utility the speed to value and all these

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,740
things are ways that I see in this sort

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:47,400
of new digital age people measure their

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:49,470
success so we like to talk about digital

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,690
transformation that's a great word if

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,730
you walk into your company or talk to

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,180
your CIO he's reading about digital

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,490
transformation and it's really you know

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,910
taking a lot of these systems into the

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,690
into the current you know web enabled

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:08,970
world from the guest web 3 oh we have

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:12,120
and we have eight million node instances

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,960
running every day and we see every the

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,330
vast majority of our community using

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,730
more and more of that every time we also

00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:24,390
see huge growth in China they're the

00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:30,450
second largest population outside of the

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:31,770
US using the survey and what they're

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,330
doing with that is they're bringing

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:37,020
legacy systems to the cloud

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:39,450
they're building micro services they're

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:42,240
node is a great great solution or

00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,380
service framework mobile application

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,610
delivery I'll talk a little bit about

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,740
that a little bit API brokering it's

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:53,060
just a good solid integration platform

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:56,340
and and it's very flexible and that

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:59,960
JavaScript is great as a copy for

00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,960
cross-platform delivery

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:09,170
this is sort of the break down of how

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,980
people are using that so we see a lot of

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,250
people using it for back-end services

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,990
full-stack

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,630
I think full stack is always a great

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:20,180
solution I got an email yesterday that

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,910
said for 30 dollars I can get trained on

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,250
how to be a full stack developer which

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:28,970
I'm sure most of you would laugh because

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,890
it's $30 and probably five years to

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,130
really become a very good full stack

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,290
developer but I mean obviously I did pay

00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:41,000
my $30 and I'll have my certificate in

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:43,240
four to six weeks but I think think the

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,630
thing that is distinguishing about

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,700
nodejs as it has been brought a whole

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,950
new population developers into full

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,110
stack development because of the ability

00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:57,350
of running Java in the backend

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:59,360
JavaScript on the backend but this is

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,220
sort of our breakdown we see good

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,330
traction in IOT I have some other

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:08,950
examples of that that I'll share shortly

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:14,350
but what start was serverless so

00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:18,260
serverless is the hot new thing it's the

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:21,350
things like amazon lambda google cloud

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:25,450
functions as your functions bluemix is

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:28,790
open wisk all these things are are just

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:31,730
the level of abstraction on top of the

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,290
cloud but it's really interesting makes

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:38,150
it easier for developers to get into

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:41,450
production no js' was the first language

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:44,660
and runtime onager functions cloud

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,570
functions lambda Twilio just last week

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:50,240
or the week before I launched a new

00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:54,860
cloud function service that is built on

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:58,580
no js' and we have we have lots and lots

00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,890
of examples but no js' and server lists

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:04,580
are like peas and carrots I guess they

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:07,959
just go together and we see a lot of our

00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,820
community being sysex successful there

00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:13,250
we see people like Netflix who's

00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,329
breaking up their big job applications

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:20,100
into small micro services running

00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:22,139
and in discreet containers things in

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:34,709
lambda things things in the container

00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:36,600
services and in Amazon in general web

00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:41,189
application services that's another one

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,959
of our strong spots and in the thing

00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:44,850
that's really interesting is because of

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,040
the ability to utilize some of these

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,629
frameworks it's easy for them to develop

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:54,749
cross-platform so mobile the desktop and

00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:59,489
we see some good success there solos the

00:15:54,749 --> 00:16:02,999
home improvement aggregated their

00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:04,980
services layer and now they can

00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:08,089
completely redesign their high-traffic

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,739
website really quickly and easily

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:14,040
they're a huge success story for us as

00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:18,959
is Capital One using those aggregation

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:22,049
tier as well and it makes it makes the

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:28,619
platform and delivery less dependent on

00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:31,829
the technology because JavaScript mobile

00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:33,839
were great in Mabel and I got a I got to

00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:36,389
admit I'm like that guy at the kids

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,009
baseball game who thinks he's doing all

00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:40,169
this cool stuff and he's just bragging

00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:42,119
about his kid that's what an executive

00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:43,829
director does is he brags about all this

00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:46,470
the work that people like Michael does

00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:47,879
and then other people do so hopefully

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,480
this gives you an idea of what we're

00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:54,540
doing but I think the it's worth noting

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,639
cuz honestly I think nude is probably

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,970
one of the most humble projects out

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,879
there like this is this is huge to have

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,669
8 million instances running every day at

00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,279
the scale that we're running at the in

00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:11,579
the places we're running without having

00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,169
a lot of formal coordination the Cloud

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,699
Foundry people they have a they have a

00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:17,159
large staff of people that are

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,610
coordinating this event coordinating the

00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:23,490
foundation we have a huge member base

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:25,529
nodejs is is very very organic and

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,809
despite not having that high level

00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:28,710
coordination the people that are working

00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:33,799
on it or doing

00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:39,149
some pretty crazy complicated things and

00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:41,340
there it's everywhere but obviously in

00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:44,820
the mobile space the difference in in

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,070
the way asynchronous Leafs work versus

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,940
callbacks there's some advantages there

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:55,020
for the mobile traffic fact that we

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:57,450
support run on TCP and not HTTP there is

00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:02,279
some low overhead for client-server

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:05,070
communication and probably one of the

00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:08,100
best examples of that is Twitter so

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,870
Twitter announced in February that they

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:14,039
had moved 100 percent of their mobile

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:16,140
traffic to a node.js framework that's

00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:19,110
that's pretty impressive that's that's a

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:25,860
use case that that shows just massive

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:30,210
massive scale we also have a good

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:33,570
footprint not an IOT we see that there's

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:37,820
a lot of packages for Arduino we see

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:41,940
that there's projects like no dredge

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:45,149
popping up and we see actual use cases

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,029
like this company sky catch sky catch

00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:50,490
builds drones they build drones not so

00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:53,070
you can fly them for fun but they build

00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,380
them to gather data and they're real

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:58,649
product is data aggregation and

00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,350
manipulation and they actually run their

00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:03,510
and for structure on Amazon lambda they

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,460
gather all this data from drones mapping

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:14,250
buildings etc and then pull it together

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:15,840
in a really robust way so in the

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,899
software world this is what's called the

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,450
NASCAR slide gives you try and put as

00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:25,289
many logos in a small space as possible

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:27,090
to impress people and but it should be

00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,279
impressive because if you look at all

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,559
the police places that MIT is in

00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,950
production and running I mean from the

00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:37,370
Wall Street Journal to things like Wired

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:40,950
and all the Condon asta product

00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:47,040
properties from uber uber zaps written

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:51,050
to node Airbnb etc etc etc it's it's

00:19:47,040 --> 00:20:00,630
very very large footprint of users and

00:19:51,050 --> 00:20:02,040
very very very robust so I think I moved

00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,720
that slide so I'm not going to hit that

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,130
one here's the other thing that's

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,460
interesting is where people were

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:11,910
deploying node so at the time of the

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,370
survey was the middle of last year so

00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,860
Amazon Web Services was there the gray

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,780
lines are indicating people that are

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,360
going to increase their usage on those

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:26,550
platforms people are doing on-premise

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,860
infrastructure the reason I I think that

00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,540
I would add to the survey it didn't have

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,340
it specifically would be how many people

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:36,420
are deploying to Cloud Foundry either

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:39,780
via ibm's bluemix or on-premise i don't

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,420
think that calls out that well but all

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,850
the places you'd expect obviously

00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,640
they're developing as well they're

00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,500
developing it in on-premise Heroku is

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,140
pretty high up on that list I was a

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,430
little surprised by that as well as

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:59,820
digitalocean but but people were

00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:01,800
deploying back the the majority of node

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:06,900
to cloud infrastructure as they probably

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:09,030
are with many of their apps reason we

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,610
like node is because it increases

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:16,230
productivity earlier on I said developer

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:19,590
ease but 68% of our survey results say

00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:22,290
that developer productivity was was one

00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,930
of the main reasons that they invested

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:30,600
in node along with reduced deployment

00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:32,730
cost and increased performance and over

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,090
time we see that those benefits get

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,500
bigger and bigger so in every category

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,340
the more they use node the better the

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,340
prett spear Ian's was

00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,809
so there's this this the other thing

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,360
that's nice is that we're when you

00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:53,150
compare node to other open-source

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:56,150
projects that are popular we're really

00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:58,850
really high and if you look at this was

00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:02,480
the battery open source software index

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:07,640
the boss index and they listed Linux as

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:10,130
the number one on their index and I

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,170
think get in MySQL we're number two and

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,480
number three node was number four docker

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,940
was a little farther down the list and

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,570
Hadoop in elastic and some of the other

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:23,150
popular above source projects but of the

00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:29,299
hundred or so projects they ranked we're

00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:32,120
the top five and just sort of a nude by

00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:34,340
the numbers overview we had eight

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,840
million node users as I've said over and

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,040
over again I like to brag about that

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,230
because I used to be in a little

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,960
open-source project and I'd be like we

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,030
have ten thousand users sounds good

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,700
eight million sounds real good we have

00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:51,169
over a billion platform a billion

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:55,610
package downloads per week we have 36

00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:59,870
thousand stars on github over 1100

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:03,440
contributed to Ned core 400 packages

00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:07,910
published every day and 100 percent

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,860
growth year every year we also the thing

00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,600
that's really impressive to me this is

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,250
from node source node source as a member

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,549
of our foundation they this node by the

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,200
numbers this is our contributor growth

00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:20,809
over the last couple years so it's not

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:26,059
just an active user ecosystem it's an

00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:27,799
active contributor use ecosystem and the

00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,690
downloads are growing accordingly to

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:34,070
once again from their source but you can

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:38,299
see the blue the the purple and the sort

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:41,210
of bright blue line at the top is year

00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,500
every year so the bottom is 2014 2015

00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,380
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,390
that's huge growth if we map that out

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,410
they would be that awesome hockey stick

00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,410
like the last graph

00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:58,320
and here's another interesting fact is

00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:00,910
the fact that so w3 text is one of those

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,910
companies that surveys websites to see

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:05,710
what they're running and I just saw this

00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,630
in the last actually I pulled in on June

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,870
10th so it's real fresh data but they're

00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:13,480
showing position and they've actually

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:16,059
positioned node alongside Apache and

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,510
nginx and is Lightspeed and the other

00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:24,090
ones and what they showed was that

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:27,669
nodejs is has a huge adoption at high

00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:30,070
high traffic sites so they're right

00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:32,530
there in that upper there the high high

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,510
upper left so they're the sites that are

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,549
doing massive amounts of traffic are

00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,410
also using their Jas and they're

00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:44,140
identifying as nodejs which is is

00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:46,059
interesting to me our footprints growing

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:51,309
not just in the US but all over the

00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:55,570
world obviously China has been huge

00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:58,480
other asia-pacific countries immediate

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:01,600
Latin so everywhere like nerds hot my

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,210
boss said to me I think there's a like

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,340
an established project now I'm like it's

00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,070
still a growth project and and it's

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:11,580
growing at exponential rates it's just

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,580
amazing

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:20,920
this is sort of a overview of our users

00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:21,940
and their usage profile so mm what

00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,300
versions they have in production

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:28,540
obviously Michael talked about our LTS

00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,940
plans this is a little dated because we

00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,500
just came out with eight but the thing

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,690
that I wanted to point out to you is in

00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,330
the upper right hand corner is the years

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:41,440
using node and those those numbers are

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:45,370
somewhat telling because there is a

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,640
large percentage of 35% with three plus

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:54,100
years and nodes so it is it is mature

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:56,640
but it's still growing and it's it's

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,640
it's grown

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,940
you

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:17,540
a little bit more about our speakers so

00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:21,710
while we are very English centric as

00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:25,540
most of ideas we do see a huge uptick in

00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:29,990
other countries and we see Germans

00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:34,550
obviously Chinese Portuguese is the

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:39,680
interesting one there so as I noted

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:41,570
earlier note is governed by a foundation

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,490
we're there to provide governance and

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,410
resources to make sure that the

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:47,540
ecosystem is healthy and growing and

00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:51,170
supported with all the resources that we

00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:54,080
need so that is my job is to make sure

00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:56,570
that we are creating ecosystem around a

00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,320
node that that you can depend on over

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:03,620
the years and here's just a little slide

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,440
of who supports nodes so IBM Intel join

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,830
it which is now part of my samsung

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,990
Microsoft PayPal and red hat are our

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,790
Platinum's then we have GoDaddy and they

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:20,230
would source and then we have quite a

00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:22,790
few silver platforms but because of that

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:27,560
we do exist

00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:29,150
to actually help bridge the the

00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,720
financial support to our development

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,830
community in our community in general

00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,150
there is an individual member

00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:40,760
opportunity and we are getting together

00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:43,100
for our annual conference in October

00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:48,190
you're all invited hope to see you in

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,190
Vancouver and thanks

00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:54,230
[Applause]

00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,200
questions for mark sticker

00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,900
so I'm not the best

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,880
that but we actually have two companies

00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,090
that join the foundation that specialize

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,730
that and that is snick and lift security

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:26,590
and lift security is donating all of

00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,960
their secure data so that we get a good

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:31,150
footprint on on that so we can make an

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,750
informed decision on that we also have

00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:37,390
an ecosystem of experts from IBM to node

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:40,779
source to others who who part of their

00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:43,690
offering is their expertise and helping

00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:52,860
to provide you know secure deployments

00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:52,860
