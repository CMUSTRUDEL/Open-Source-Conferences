Title: SAP Hybris Smart Driving Showcase
Publication date: 2017-06-22
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Silicon Valley 2017
Description: 
	SAP Hybris Smart Driving Showcase - Featured by Microservices and Cloud Foundry to Empower the Development Ecosystem [B] - Torsten Born, SAP    

Cloud computing demonstrates, how to think beyond the idea of an unscalable infrastructure. Applying this idea to cars, the showcase SAP Hybris Smart Driving demonstrates the possibility to access additional range of functions. Increasing or decreasing horse power can for example impact the insurance costs. It utilizes SAP Hybris Revenue Cloud for subscription and pay-per-use billing. Hands-free is a must-have in cars, therefore voice recognition technology and digital assistant service are used to subscribe for additional range of functions.

Following the micro service architecture and API-first pattern in our applications like SAP Hybris Revenue Cloud, customers, partners and developers can easily integrate but also reinvent their business model. The necessary scalability and flexibility is provided by SAP Cloud Platform and Cloud Foundry. During the presentation we will demonstrate a smart driving adventure in virtual reality and explaining the architecture behind the scene. The architectural concept provides insights, on how integration and extensibility concepts could look like. Discussion on the blueprint are welcome.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
so welcome and thank you for joining my

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,680
talk today I want to give you an

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,380
overview on a proof of concept we have

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,360
worked on and of that I want to

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,170
underline the importance of Cloud

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,670
Foundry and such future scenarios and I

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,350
have a lot of hardware here with me

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,289
today so finger crossed that everything

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,640
will work out as planned but before we

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,240
get started let me introduce myself

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,480
first

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,119
so I'm twisting born I'm part of the SI

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,000
p Hyper's organization and SI p hypo

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,980
stands for customer engagement and

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,460
commerce so to make it short we are

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,870
focusing on front office applications

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:45,360
b2c and then looking on the product

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,570
portfolio of our organization

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,520
omni-channel is key for sure but you

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,250
also have solutions like a content and

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,230
experience management solution we have a

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,420
billing solution you just saw before in

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,910
the talk there's a commerce suite where

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,590
you can build up a commerce door big

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,660
trends are counting on us with that

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,290
there's a marketing solutions we can do

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,560
marketing planning but as well executed

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,189
there's a service in the sales solution

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,380
and so on

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,000
but we also have a technology stack we

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,830
might have thought of in one of the last

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,710
Cloud Foundry summits it's called si P

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,869
Hyper's as a service it's our micro

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,700
service orchestration framework very

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,700
important because we deeply believe in

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,340
the ecosystem around us and it's running

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,630
on si P cloud platform which provides us

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,790
the needed Cloud Foundry instance and my

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,850
team is responsible for research and

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,329
innovation and we have a lot of

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,590
innovation teams spread around the world

00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:45,780
so for example there's an innovation

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,729
team in Munich locator that's called sa

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,189
P hypose labs and they are mainly

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,320
focusing on innovations around Commerce

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,170
but we also have a physical lab a

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,700
physical innovation lab in China it's

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,219
called sa P Hyper's the digital

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,500
innovation space it's located in Chengdu

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,240
China and my colleagues are over there

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,060
are doing a lot of research in the area

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,399
of social media machine learning so for

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,649
example how we better can integrate and

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,700
WeChat and how we can get use of AI

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,590
technologies and something like that

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,340
and because Chengdu is the so-called

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,379
Silicon Valley of China we are working a

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,019
lot with local startups to do Co

00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:26,760
innovation and to get new ideas and

00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:32,260
that's the labs here on the picture and

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:35,410
my team is mainly focusing on the idea

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:39,099
to combine as many ASAP high press

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:42,010
products as we can to build up kind of

00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,910
innovation lighthouse or showcase to

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,830
tell a story

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,170
so to help customers and partners to

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,049
understand how our products can help

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,610
them to transform their business into

00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:53,769
the digital world so we want to tell a

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,450
story we want to be a mind opener okay

00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,250
we really don't want to sell our proof

00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,280
of concepts it's really about telling a

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,239
story and as you can see we have

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,130
showcases and all different kind of

00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,230
industry industries so public

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,150
transportation for example but as well

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,130
as an entertainment and hospitality and

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,680
as well as near automotive industry and

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,530
we as a team we are not an expert in all

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,940
of those industries because remember

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,709
it's not about that we you know go too

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,480
deep it's really about to tell a story

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,639
everyone gets even I can tell my family

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,560
and we can discuss about that and then

00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,120
people and companies out there can

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,700
transform this idea into their own

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,319
business this is we did a goal what we

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,100
are aiming with innovation lighthouses

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,660
and today in this talk I want to talk

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,940
about one of our latest and greatest

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,910
showcase it's called smart driving which

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,560
was released in May on sapphires and sa

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,290
peak conference and I'm really happy to

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,260
show it here on stage as well I mean

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:50,859
talking about smart driving everyone has

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,690
in mind self-driving cars okay

00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:54,790
state-of-the-art technology right now

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,859
and it's not any longer science fiction

00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,569
when I'm coming from Europe and from and

00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:00,730
based in Germany and I'm coming to the

00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:02,829
u.s. here to Silicon Valley at least a

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,480
few weeks back diverse all that kind of

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:07,180
Google cars around me you know the

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,700
self-driving cars so it's it's reality

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,380
already it's just a matter of time we

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,470
can hack at hands-on and have our own

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,660
safe driving car but what's also we

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,970
already have access to is for example

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,010
Tesla and Tesla is doing cars with a lot

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,900
of soft grain and that's something we

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,760
really love to see white as engineers I

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,800
think what they are doing or just a

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,110
regular doing soft

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,190
updates and Tweety taking care so

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,310
there's really something we are looking

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,770
forward but what they are doing is they

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,990
are sometimes releasing new features in

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,990
the car so for example the autopilot in

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,190
a major update so to call and what they

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,560
are doing is from a business model

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,240
perspective they are asking to charge up

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,860
front so that you want to access those

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,710
kind of functionality because it's just

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,750
software you need to pay money for to

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,430
can use those functions and features and

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,720
that is fine don't get me wrong they

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,340
should earn their money because it's a

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,069
lovely car and I would love to own my

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,870
own one by myself and a software is

00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:04,020
great but it's just we want to think

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,909
about how we can we sing that model

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,669
because white I mean we are cloud

00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:10,560
natives so we are used to cloud we are

00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,810
used to transaction based systems we are

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,539
used to paper use as you have just seen

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,639
in the talk before so we want to we

00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,860
think the business model regards why do

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,900
I need to pay upfront phone for that

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,969
kind of functionality it's like on

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,340
premise why it's like sending out in DVD

00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:28,740
and you get me to check for it so we

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:32,699
want to bring paper use scenario into

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,080
the car so as example could be with the

00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,900
by keeping with test love of the

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,759
autopilot something like tomorrow I have

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,099
a business meeting I will be a long

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,659
drive on the highway and yes an

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:44,550
autopilot would definitely make sense

00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:46,289
and I only want to pay for it while I'm

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,180
on the highway and while I'm driving to

00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:49,860
a business meeting but maybe on a

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,930
regular day when I'm just going to the

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,819
office and you know going back home and

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,729
doing shopping the autopilot is not

00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,550
needed so I don't need to pay for it or

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:01,710
another example could be maybe you drive

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,449
a new Porsche with a lot of horsepower

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,310
and you might know in Germany some

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,719
highways are unlimited so you can really

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,120
have some family food you can impress

00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,319
your girlfriend and so on and yes I want

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,449
to have full access to the full

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,219
horsepower during that time but maybe

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,659
again when I'm trust on a regular day

00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:17,550
and going to the office and going back

00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:19,680
home I don't need to full host poor

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,110
horsepower all the time so I can trust

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,960
would use it and by doing so immediately

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,789
my insurance rate will go down because

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,009
it's not so whiskey you know I'm more

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,509
safe driver and something like that so

00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:32,370
this is really new business models

00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:36,690
behind that concept when you think about

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,430
paper use scenarios in a car and that is

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,479
something we want to come up with in the

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,360
showcase much

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,689
so we wanted as explained we we sing the

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,650
business model in this car in this

00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:49,800
example we want to we think about

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,479
functions and features paper use in the

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,240
car okay

00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,069
but for that we definitely to have a

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,080
high flexible and scalable

00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,210
infrastructure that why we are going for

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,729
s AP claw platform with the Cloud

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,460
Foundry edition as a foundation and yes

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:06,930
we want to be totally open that why we

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,069
are going for a micro service

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,560
architecture an API first pattern and I

00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:15,900
would definitely love to show you the

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,779
whole showcase in a real car here on

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,550
state try to have your Tesla or fu port

00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:23,339
but as you can imagine it's not always

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,529
so easy to have access to that car see

00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,479
on stage so that why we as a team

00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:31,620
decided to make it more simple we will

00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:33,509
go for virtual reality okay and I'm now

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,409
he had the lucky guy I can have some fun

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:40,199
here on stage 12 in a car wet so now for

00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:43,889
that for a moment let's go to the demo

00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:46,499
and skip PowerPoint okay and what we

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:50,270
first need to do in order to start the

00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:55,949
demo we need to create a new driver okay

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:58,080
for that we have built and sorry we have

00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:01,289
build in custom UI following the SI p UI

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,270
pattern fury its build with UI v as you

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:05,580
can see you can sign up a new driver and

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,469
there as well as a challenge object and

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,649
let me just explain for a second what we

00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:14,580
win with challenge a challenge for us is

00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:16,800
bringing gamification into driving a car

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,779
think about what Apple is doing with the

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,430
Apple watch or Nike is to it they try to

00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:24,599
motivate you with kind of challenges or

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,060
something like getting more on the

00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,979
street Duma running you know be more

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,479
healthy something like that and that's

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,969
something you want to clean into cars as

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,800
well of challenges something like you

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,719
get in the car in the morning there's a

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,479
challenge coming up telling you hey

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,669
Torsten try to reduce the average speed

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,310
of your car by 2 percent within the next

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,899
two weeks something simple okay and if

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,819
I'm achieving that goal I will earn some

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,500
loyalty points maybe and yet at the end

00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,980
of the week or when I'm achieve to go

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,400
with Zoe

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,230
or maybe I get some discount or May

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,350
again my insurance rate will go down

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,600
because I'm a more secure driver okay so

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,030
it's really about motivation and that's

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,950
behind the function of the challenge I

00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,540
don't want to get into that too much

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,910
today because we want to focus on the

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,120
paper use but it's still a single point

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:15,920
of an T to create a new driver so let's

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,600
do that so I go to sign up let's go

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,990
there

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:24,080
oops selector challenge just take the

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,880
software here for example and create a

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,650
new driver

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,560
you only need now the first name so

00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:33,080
let's take my name of cloud foundry and

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,370
I now can select the vehicle and there

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,710
are two options in there for the moment

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,420
today as game car in show car so I will

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,300
choose game car because remember I want

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,400
to show the virtual reality scenario but

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,440
it is completely working with real cars

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,840
as well so we have done it as long as

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,060
the cars IOT enabled we have access to

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:56,570
the data we can do that so but again

00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:58,880
let's stick to game car so now the

00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,800
driver is created what I can do now I

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,120
will immediately stay a star to

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,270
challenge so that we don't need to go

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,640
back to that you are you okay we can get

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,500
rid of it so here we are now I can start

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,180
it and what I will do now and now it's

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:18,950
the time for some fun now I can go into

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:21,110
the corporate get into my car okay let's

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,300
just turn up so now as you can see and

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,000
you would expect from Rio to reality I

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,370
now can put the classes in my hand over

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,970
here no magic behind that now one more

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,650
clickers missing here we are so what you

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,460
can see you are now in a new Porsche

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:39,050
it's SI p hi prosper inner tube h4p wide

00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,090
you can look around in the car you can

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:44,600
have some fun and what is very important

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:46,700
to understand we are currently on a very

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,010
famous German racing track it's called a

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,510
new book wing I mean what's happening

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,730
when you are getting into the cars you

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,760
can see on the left top side there's

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,440
kind an overview on subscriptions and

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,210
functions for features that are

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,290
available to me okay a

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,750
subscription-based

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,060
think about you get in your today's car

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,230
you know it's like a head-up display or

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,380
might be integrated in

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,600
system or yes in a new near future it

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,880
might be argumentative reality where you

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,400
have those informations and because we

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,770
are in a racing track it wouldn't make

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,570
fun to tune down and tune up the

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,400
horsepower wide I mean we want to have

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,900
the full access to the car so it's more

00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,630
about in this case in this showcase

00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,430
about supportive functions so if you

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,260
could if you are a good driver you don't

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,940
need them but if you need some help like

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,220
I will you will see in a minute they

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,470
definitely make sense so for example you

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:39,740
can turn on here you have the overview

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:42,170
on ABS you can turn on traction control

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,660
or maybe yes or something like a perfect

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,880
line assistant so to helps you know to

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,950
do better timing and yes to make some

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,290
fun every time you horn we will charge

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,450
you as well ok you will see that in a

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,190
second so yeah there you can see all the

00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,650
subscriptions like a starting point like

00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,090
information I can push the classes just

00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,660
to the side for a second because

00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:04,790
otherwise it's too hard for me to drive

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,500
so what we can do now and now I will

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,140
start driving and I will get into the

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,720
road so here I have my controller I'm a

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,100
little bit nervous here on stage right

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,440
so what will happens now as you can see

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,690
in a left top corner again the actual

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,700
driver cost and Claude volunteers trust

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,950
selected the one we created before all

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,350
functions and as a part of functions are

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:27,260
disabled because I am you know I want to

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,120
do my best but as you can see maybe I'm

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,520
not the best driver

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,310
let us least try to get around here

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,830
and what's coming up here is kind like

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:39,680
an environment ation think about and

00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,450
remember we are s AP Hyper's customer

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,120
engagement and commerce so it's all

00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,370
about marketing ho maybe we keep on the

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,230
street and there's a recommendation

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,700
coming up there what is happening and

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,950
why is this coming up because based on

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,770
machine learning we are watching and

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,900
looking how you behave as a driver and

00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,850
if you've been if you know that there is

00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,320
some support needed we can do kind of

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,240
feature recommendation product

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,730
recommendations like you can see here

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,000
and what I can do now definitely abs

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:12,770
seems like it makes sense to me I can

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,020
now just activate them and get use of

00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,300
them so now it's turned on turned on

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,610
that's turn traction control on as well

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,529
and what you can see now I

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,720
try hopefully it will go a little bit

00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:25,910
better now and what's happened as well

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,100
as if you closely look on the bill we

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,550
also charge money for as soon as you

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,320
turn on door supporter functions right

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,120
you know we are twelve dollars and so on

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,430
it's time-based right so its measured

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,350
and what I promised you remember every

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:43,190
time I hon I will also try to get

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,519
charged for so let's do that so you can

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,620
see here I get no charged for as well

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,790
okay let's stop the car I think you got

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,010
the story you're right it's about

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,290
activating deactivating functions in a

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:58,010
carp cleanliness business model and at

00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:00,680
the end you get get charged for so now

00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,660
let's go just back to the UI for a

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,850
second and stop the challenge we created

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,440
before and what happens now is that the

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,910
copy' trust we're driving is getting to

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,240
the starting point so that you can later

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:14,750
on have some fun as well but remember

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,430
because you were driving the car and you

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,519
were charged you money what we are doing

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,890
is we created trust here based on your

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,350
consumption with atomic printer and

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:28,100
invoice telling you okay to us and you

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:30,140
have charged no 27 dollars okay so

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,730
remember if you later come by and want

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,410
to try for car please put in some cash

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,480
with you because I don't accept credit

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,370
cards okay

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,930
okay that's just about some having some

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,890
fun and connecting you know internet or

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:45,470
sync stuff and so on for sure d holy no

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,640
is this available as in PDF as well you

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,120
can print it out you can send it around

00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,329
yes no magic behind it alright what we

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,970
have seen so far is really the consumer

00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:57,649
side I am as a driver in the car I can

00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,079
work with the features I can activate

00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:02,329
them and can benefit of them what we

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,890
also want to do is have a quick look on

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:05,660
how it looks like from an OEM

00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,160
perspective so if you are a car

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,620
manufacturer and you are neighbor in

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,510
those features how it looks and you have

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,640
seen this already in the demo before and

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,589
I talked before we are using as one of

00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,320
the foundations to make that happen

00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:19,940
si P hypose we have a new cloud okay so

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,740
I don't want to repeat everything you

00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,360
already have seen you have already seen

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,029
as if you have a new cloud they are

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,829
experts in the room model and I am in

00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:30,319
this functionality what we only have

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,000
used in this scenario s we have built up

00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:33,290
subscriptions you have seen them at the

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,829
beginning

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:38,959
and the billing information so just we

00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:42,199
have a quick look again on that when I

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,739
go into building they are all the bills

00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:48,230
and users and drivers we created so far

00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:50,389
so let us take one doesn't matter now

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,949
Torsten as ap for example there you can

00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,809
see again they are the subscriptions

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:55,879
there are the functions I assign to that

00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:57,679
subscription and to the driver and you

00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,029
can see what you've used and what we are

00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,920
will charge and by the end of the month

00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:05,299
so pay as I use but that's the backbone

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:08,540
of the solution and of the showcase with

00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:10,610
that back to the slides for a moment so

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,040
what we have seen just to repeat as an

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,749
overview when you get into the car what

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,249
subscriptions are available to you what

00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:18,799
you can access and what's the price tag

00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:20,929
for it you have seen the overview on

00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,929
what functions are activated and what

00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:25,549
you will be charged for and have some

00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:29,149
fun yes we printed out with a thermal

00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:31,790
printer as well as we have a classical

00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:35,059
invoice as in PDF version available and

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,839
you have seen from an OEM perspective

00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:41,029
how they can use ACP hypos revenue cloud

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,879
so what we mainly talked so far it's

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:46,129
really the inner circle what I can do as

00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,079
in car manufacturer by providing the

00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:50,509
state and its functions to a customer

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,970
but remember I already told you at the

00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,699
beginning we are heavily belief in a

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,850
scalable and why a man based on cloud

00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:01,399
foundry as well as an open API micro

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:04,100
service based architecture and just

00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,809
think about we cannot only do this now

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,659
an inner circle we can also have an

00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:10,610
outer circle we can ask our ecosystem

00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:13,669
and as I already mentioned we heavily

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,949
believe in to be part of such setups and

00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:18,199
areas as well because if they have

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,899
access to the data and to the interfaces

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,039
based on an API first driven

00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:24,559
architecture they can access the data

00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:27,079
they can create additional business

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,590
models okay and they can be another

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,630
benefit from us and end-user and so for

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,370
example the insurance case I explained

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,899
before like ok when you have more

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:40,309
horsepower the insurance where it goes

00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:42,260
up and goes down and so on a partner of

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,600
us we try to do so what they have done

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,640
is they build a proof of concept on top

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,730
of our proof of concept

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,500
so it's really about getting access to

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,390
the data we are providing off the car

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,980
and getting use of them and print a new

00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:59,660
business model and let me just show it

00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:01,820
to you as well so the partners ms key

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,160
global they I have a lot of experience

00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,840
in the area of insurance and what I have

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,080
done is they build that kind of

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,910
dashboard and we're in and on top of our

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,190
proof of concept and what you can see is

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,620
you have a list of all drivers that

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:18,110
we're driving so far there should be

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,480
somewhere here Here I am they asked why

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,250
I created before and I was driving and

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,720
what they are just doing it because we

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,060
are now in an open world and we are

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,490
providing our data based on API stay I

00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:31,100
trust connecting to our services and

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,570
fetching all the car data we can provide

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,490
them so on the left hand side on the

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,100
right hand side you can all you can see

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,230
all the data they have access to we can

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,600
provide them to and what I have done is

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,970
this is now a really simple example but

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,560
it can be very complex they trust in

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,810
which the data type of third party data

00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,250
so while I'm was driving in virtual

00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,100
reality on a racing track the

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,390
Nurburgring in Germany they looked up

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,550
what is the wheel better information

00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:58,340
currently and Germany - and which data

00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:00,320
and yes they could be of course a lot of

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,780
more data to in which and what I have

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,090
done is they built up a so called to

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,100
either school or in insurance school

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,200
together if data scientists they had

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,030
kind of a concept don't ask me how it

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,060
works out how the algorithm looks like

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,790
ms key global are more expert in that so

00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,140
that they are bringing up this insurance

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,150
scrolling that based on my driver

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,010
behavior my insurance rate goes up and

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,310
goes down okay and there's really a

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:29,270
market for that so back to the slides

00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:31,850
again what I was just explaining with

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,710
the insurance example is also not any

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,620
longer science fiction this is already a

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,060
reality so for example in Europe and I

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,890
guess in the u.s. it's to say and you

00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,500
can have for everything in insurance

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:45,020
okay and healthcare is a very complex

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,240
part in regards to insurance and what

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,330
you can have is an insurance for your

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,340
T's and but sometimes they are very

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,110
expensive because there is a lot of risk

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,270
you know that it's you might have some

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,580
problems and so on and in some countries

00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,120
for example in Switzerland insurance are

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,640
a danger

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,440
rate is a very high to have kind of an

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,240
insurance for your teeth

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,890
and that's something insurance companies

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,930
are thinking about how they can reduce

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,940
to a it's to have a bigger you know

00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,890
customer base and what's out there

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,220
there's a company they are providing

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,200
toothbrush which are UT enabled so they

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,270
are sharing their data you know how

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,430
often at what time how long you are

00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,140
cleaning your teeth and what I have done

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,390
remember that's the inner circle that is

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,460
the OEM that's the one who provides the

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,470
toothbrush with the data and what I have

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,110
done as they open the AP is and now

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,880
letting insurance participate in and you

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,930
can now have an insurance wait for your

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,670
T's I believe in personalized insurance

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,430
wait based on your behavior how you

00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,350
clean your T's okay so this is really

00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,540
something which happening and which is

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,130
the concept not only of the futures or

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,230
what you reality and that's a why I'm

00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,860
talking about the inner circle IOT as

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:57,350
well as an outer circle but back now for

00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,970
a second from our product portfolio you

00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,070
know that slide I've showed it on the

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,670
beginning so what we have used in the

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:07,940
showcase I trust presenting to you so

00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:10,310
yes its mobile it's cloud for sure we've

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,260
used IOT so we have an IOT enabled car

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,300
maybe it's in Rio to reality or maybe

00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,070
it's in a wheel car or again you can

00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,290
transform that to any other industry as

00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,880
well and yes we are doing notifications

00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:22,130
and recommendations or product

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,320
recommendations based on your behavior

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,180
we are using s AP high post revenue

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,770
cloud as the billing solution you have

00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,100
seen it you have heard about it in the

00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:33,710
talk before and we are using s AP high

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,540
processor servers as the orchestration

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,030
framework for the micro services we've

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,950
built and again s AP cloud platform

00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,260
provides us the needed Cloud Foundry has

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,330
an highly scalable infrastructure and

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:49,490
this is now very important to understand

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:51,140
why we couldn't do that before and the

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,720
inner circle as well as the outer circle

00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,280
based on the interfaces we are providing

00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,850
in the scalability we have a cloud

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,760
foundry

00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:01,460
to be open for an ecosystem and to let

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:04,100
them participate in such scenarios and

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,080
be and can extend our solutions wouldn't

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,030
be possible before we have access to

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,830
that kind of technology and it's very

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,990
important for us and I hope you get it

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,560
from all our cloud for a cloud platform

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,450
talks

00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,400
in regards to Cloud Foundry it's really

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,210
in very empowered important foundation

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,370
to be open and flexible which brings me

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,620
to a quick look on the architecture

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,440
overview not too much details but you

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,640
get an understanding how it looks like

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,640
so on the left hand side you can see

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,590
there as my desktop machine with two-way

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,470
simulation running on with we have you

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,220
know hijacked and added functionality

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:41,600
like enabled the gaming curve of IOT

00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:45,260
information and the Tama printer is

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,940
connected to my local machine what we

00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,490
have an important line isn't founder may

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,260
for a foundation our product so we have

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,420
s AP hyper so every new cloud we already

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,880
talked about what I haven't talked about

00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,190
so far is AP vehicle insights so all the

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,020
IOT data are we getting from the car we

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,420
store an essay P week on insights and s

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,790
AP vehicle insights is a solution based

00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,820
on s AP HANA running in the cloud

00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:10,220
platform very scalable you know you can

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,840
put all the lot of data in what we're

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,880
getting out of the car and again

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,760
hypothesis services one foundation for

00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,230
us we are using it as an persistency

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,590
package where we can store additional

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,970
data as well as a customer object when

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,790
you are creating a new driver for

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,710
example how looks the orchestration of

00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,480
the scenario what we have done us I

00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,600
already explained the heart of the

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,550
scenario and we call it a mashup is to

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,890
challenge object alright that's the

00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:39,350
place where that's now you comes

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:42,740
together we have with just a client

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:45,500
where you can set up and sign off in you

00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,510
a new Trevor we have in route service

00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,040
news engine based on machine learning so

00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,530
that we can do different kind of

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,080
recommendations and yes we have wept a

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,700
few of our services and products as you

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,040
can see the revenue cloud force aid as

00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,720
well as the vehicle inside the state to

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,930
in which the data while we are accessing

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,750
it and based on the open framework and

00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,360
AP is now apart and like ms key clover

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,400
can easily extend resolution and what I

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,590
have done us they have built in Internet

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,200
of Things analyzer that's the the engine

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:17,350
they have built to do together of data

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,480
scientists and building of immortal and

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,670
for demo purpose they also created an

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,770
insurance going dashboard you have seen

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,050
on top of food and everything connects

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,090
to our interfaces and

00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:31,300
API first pattern so it's really easier

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:33,520
and now let's just talk from an SI p

00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,740
hypose perspective now everything which

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,020
was mark Orleans that's really following

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,880
the microservice architecture and the

00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,210
API first pattern again we heavily

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:46,900
believe in that and everything also no

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:49,690
one is running on Cloud Foundry so that

00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,940
we have the scalability and even a very

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,470
important strategic project for us so

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,870
for example s ap hypos we have a new

00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,370
cloud is completely rebuild as explained

00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,290
in the session before and it's

00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,900
completely utilizing cloud foundry

00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:05,620
scalability and using micro services as

00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,510
a foundation so just we're a bit of what

00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,570
you see what have you seen so you have

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:12,430
seen another example of an pepper use so

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,490
now you two get FS ap hypose revenue

00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:18,640
cloud you have seen a digital

00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:22,300
transformation of it scenario powered by

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,690
a needed and scalable environment and

00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,880
architecture provided by cloud foundry

00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:31,840
and you have seen when you follow that

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,150
kind of concept how partners easily can

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,070
in which businesses and business

00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:40,090
solutions out there and you can enable

00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:42,370
with that D ecosystem everything I told

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:45,760
you now in 25 minutes is available in 30

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:47,500
seconds I don't want to roll the video

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,390
there are something on YouTube available

00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,490
I will keep it in the slides if you want

00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:55,590
to have a look at feel free to do so

00:25:51,490 --> 00:26:00,900
it's explains that scenario high level

00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:04,270
both that I will set up the whole

00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,130
showcase on our s AP cloud platform

00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,230
boost for today so if you want to have

00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,780
some fun want to drive a Porsche on our

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,270
famous racing track come by but please

00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:16,870
remember Prince on cash right no credit

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,710
card and we've dad thanks a lot for

00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,960
listening and if there are questions

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:23,500
right now you can ask them now or maybe

00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,520
