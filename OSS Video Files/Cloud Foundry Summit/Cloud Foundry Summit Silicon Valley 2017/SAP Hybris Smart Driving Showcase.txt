Description: 
	SAP Hybris Smart Driving Showcase - Featured by Microservices and Cloud Foundry to Empower the Development Ecosystem [B] - Torsten Born, SAP    

Cloud computing demonstrates, how to think beyond the idea of an unscalable infrastructure. Applying this idea to cars, the showcase SAP Hybris Smart Driving demonstrates the possibility to access additional range of functions. Increasing or decreasing horse power can for example impact the insurance costs. It utilizes SAP Hybris Revenue Cloud for subscription and pay-per-use billing. Hands-free is a must-have in cars, therefore voice recognition technology and digital assistant service are used to subscribe for additional range of functions.

Following the micro service architecture and API-first pattern in our applications like SAP Hybris Revenue Cloud, customers, partners and developers can easily integrate but also reinvent their business model. The necessary scalability and flexibility is provided by SAP Cloud Platform and Cloud Foundry. During the presentation we will demonstrate a smart driving adventure in virtual reality and explaining the architecture behind the scene. The architectural concept provides insights, on how integration and extensibility concepts could look like. Discussion on the blueprint are welcome.
