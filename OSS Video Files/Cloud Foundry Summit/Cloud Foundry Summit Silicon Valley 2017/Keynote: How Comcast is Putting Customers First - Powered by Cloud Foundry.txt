Comcast is the largest cable provider in the United States, meaning it is vital for its services to be available at all times to meet enormous customer demand -- while ensuring its development teams can implement updates continuously, without sacrificing uptime. Join Greg Otto, Uma Tumala and Christopher Tretina from Comcast as they discuss the reasons they chose Cloud Foundry, from three unique perspectives: operations, development and line of business.

Christopher Tretina is Director of Technical Architecture at Comcast and has led the Core Architecture team that’s been driving the migration of the Enterprise Services Platform (ESP) implementation from SOA and WebLogic to the Xfinity Services Platform (XSP) built with microservices and deployed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry across numerous DevOps teams.

Uma Tumala
Comcast
Principal Engineer
Uma Tumala is a Principal Engineer at Comcast who had been working within the confines of a heavy weight back office mediation platform built on monolithic architecture for several years. Comcast explored various opportunities to divide those monolithic services into fine-grained micro services and deploy those on a cloud platform. Ultimately, Comcast opted for the power and simplicity of Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Uma served a focal role in leading significant portions of that transformation initiative, especially as it related to indoctrination of automated testing within the build pipelines, as per her background. Uma has been actively involved in each step of this transformation from day one showcasing her enthusiasm and passion in making the migration successful including seamless migration of 200+ consuming applications to the new platform. She and her team worked through many challenges in this journey and gained a great deal of knowledge in the areas of CI/CD, common frameworks, Spring Boot upgrades, monitoring and alerting set up, GSLB configurations, micro service standards, and more. In so doing, she and her team have been able to successfully migrate 90+ services over to Pivotal Cloud Foundry in a little over two years, serving 250+ million transactions with reduced operational overhead, improved ease of scalability, and heightened resiliency and availability.
