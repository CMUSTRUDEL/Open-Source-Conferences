Description: 
	Ops in the Time of Serverless Containerized Webscale - Bridget Kromhout, Pivotal    

Living #opslife makes us keenly aware of the cavernous gap between lofty ideals and 3am reality. In a perfect world, everyone would be devopsing sans effort. In the real world, sharing operational responsibility is not as easy as giving developers production access, adding them to an oncall rotation, and saying “good luck! have fun!”

When incentives mean a feature team is concerned primarily with shipping and not operability, while site reliability is someone else’s concern, conflict results. We build in graceful degradation for decentralized systems but often neglect the (just-as-essential) human interactions. As the fractal complexity of our distributed systems grows, we need mindful practices that work with our tooling and effective tools that reinforce our desired culture.

hi I'm Bridget Crum ho here from pivotal

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,960
to talk to you about the future and

00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,269
figured also that we were talking about

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,710
as many buzz words as possible so I put

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,230
as many buzz words as possible on this

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,710
slide all right

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,320
but buzz words aside the traditional

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,869
second slide I live in Minneapolis

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,390
Minnesota a state notable for having

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,460
snow every month of the year except July

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,109
which is why we hold devops days in

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,189
Minneapolis in July you should come it's

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,340
gonna be great we have many great

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:35,399
speakers including people from pivotal

00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:39,270
and I work in the tech advocacy team at

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,200
pivotal and on cloud foundry and I

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,690
podcast with arrested DevOps and I

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,160
organized about space so that's all the

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,930
things you need to know about me except

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,030
that I also probably have to cop to

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,120
having some pretty severe on-call PTSD

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,510
so I wasn't called for production from

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,890
1999 until August 2015 then I listened

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,989
to Andrew clay Shaffer when he was like

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,940
come with me if you want to live and it

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,760
turns out you get just as little sleep

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,560
when you're taking ridiculous flights as

00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,530
when you're being paged so I'm not sure

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,890
that that was the you know it didn't

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,869
actually fix the sleep issues but the

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,060
people who are operating Cloud Foundry

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,820
and I see I see Jim Park is he at least

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,729
one of the cloud ops team from pivotal

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,920
web services here do get more sleep than

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,689
your average ops person so we can dive

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,829
into that and also like with the

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:34,740
changing role of ops in a platform world

00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:36,960
I gave a couple of talks earlier this

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,869
year that I kind of whimsically entitled

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,210
computers are easy people are hard and I

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,799
use a title a provocative title like

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,829
that on purpose because it's obviously

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,740
it's a lie but there's a little bit of

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,750
truth in it because the complex systems

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,820
that we're creating you know every

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,320
presentation that you've gone to and by

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,030
the way there is no code on these slides

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,799
and if you were looking for a live demo

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,369
this is not the right room I suggest any

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,350
other room but the there are many

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,120
fantastic you know very technical

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,150
sessions here this is not one of them

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,250
but the systems that we're creating are

00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,900
highly complex and yet work way better

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,350
than a lot of the manual stuff we used

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,990
to do at the same time the human

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,030
interactions that as people are starting

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,560
to you know implement Cloud Foundry I

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,420
mean I was just sitting in a session

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,910
from JPMorgan Chase where they were

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,890
talking about how kind of work like a

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,450
skunk or steam got a lot of stuff off

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,850
the ground then you know there were

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,620
people questioning well what's happening

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,900
over there how is that gonna affect me

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,480
those human elements of how people are

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,910
concerned / confused you know

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,830
/ perhaps even you know resentful about

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,270
what you're changing in the organization

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,550
by bringing in a platform like Cloud

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,520
Foundry are actually pretty important so

00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,650
let's let's talk about them because I

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,990
think that there's problem in our

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,170
industry and I will cop to being guilty

00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,000
of this that a lot of times tech it when

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,890
left to their own devices techies are

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,930
going to pick whatever sounds like the

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,300
most exciting thing and cobble it

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,400
together and get it working and get it

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,400
into production and get their next job

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,380
and at that point the people who are

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,860
left holding the bag go like and we

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:21,430
didn't use co-founder why so getting

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,980
people to help understand that picking

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,900
whatever they can Han assemble from the

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,360
top three hits on town hacker news that

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,040
day is not necessarily going to get

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,810
their organization to where they need to

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,840
be and it's not necessarily going to

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:40,690
help them either if they've created you

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,610
know a Rube Goldberg machine they aren't

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,989
necessarily going to be able to function

00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,170
someplace where they're not allowed to

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:50,440
create more Rube Goldberg machines so I

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,570
think trying to drive - how we get to

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,220
that value I think it's it's I stole

00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,140
this slide from Andrew clay Schafer he's

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,709
used this one a bunch of times and I

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,060
love this idea of the all of the

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,070
initiatives that we have inside our

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,750
organizations because many people who

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,130
work at large enterprises there's some

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,269
place in the organization where people

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,130
are building out continuous delivery

00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,989
pipelines and there's another part of

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,640
the organization where you know maybe

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,650
they're going to cloud and then maybe

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,880
somebody else is doing DevOps because

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,639
you should just have a department for

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,449
collaboration because why not

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,979
I don't know who they collaborate with

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:23,009
but they're def op sings really hard

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:24,990
over there and like if you have a lot of

00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,699
this if this sounds familiar if inside

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,289
your large organization you have a lot

00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,789
of these different initiatives happening

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,830
I think it's something important to

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:33,870
remember is they're all basically trying

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,180
to do the same thing they're trying to

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,039
you know bring value faster they're

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,449
trying to be more stable they're trying

00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:43,740
to do an awful lot of stuff that sounds

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:45,629
suspiciously like a platform and we hear

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,210
all these buzzwords we can throw one up

00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:49,919
there like serverless I think it's it's

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,479
probably important to remember this is

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,150
actually kind of funny when I was I was

00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,770
making some slides a while ago with this

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,659
title of the stops and the time of

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,479
serverless containerize web-scale and i

00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:02,460
got a suggestion from keynote and if you

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,259
can't read it there it keynote is

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,569
suggesting for serverless suggesting

00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,550
servers and I'm like yeah you're not

00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,810
wrong because there are servers like we

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,270
can't ignore the fact that they exist

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:17,219
they you know require power and emit

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,900
heat and when we are coming up with

00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:21,120
abstractions that are super useful is

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,599
super important we shouldn't deny the

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,020
fact that we still have physical reality

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,610
that we're dealing with and there's this

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,520
a lot of this I got this from Simon

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,810
Wardley and I it's it's kind of funny

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,729
because and I'll put these slides on

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,219
later online later if you can't see that

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:40,349
particular you know detail here but it's

00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:42,210
basically just terminology of what we're

00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:45,629
calling up as what we're calling a cloud

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:48,029
you know what we're calling WTF and I

00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:50,189
think that this stuff changes a lot over

00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:52,379
time like if you look at what's happened

00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,180
in the past and you know we're we're

00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,120
probably going in the future stuff

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,800
changes a lot and so the places where we

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,080
get bogged down in those arguments

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,649
inside our organisations end up not

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,750
being maybe as constructive because we

00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:08,430
are in a time I shouldn't make it a

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,740
light of the fact that there has changed

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,560
we are in a time of significant change

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,270
like it's it's probably likely that a

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,399
lot of people you work with in tech

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:22,279
today never watch Babylon 5 I know it's

00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:25,769
tragic but like time passes what and

00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:28,199
looking at lessons from the past I think

00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:30,569
are important like the you know the

00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,969
waves of virtualization and there's or

00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:34,349
that are just now getting them some VMS

00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:37,139
and they're pretty excited about that

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:39,270
and it's like well I mean should they

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,550
jump to you know kernels tomorrow maybe

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,099
not again like the technology isn't the

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,639
point it's the way they get value from

00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:49,949
it that is the point I think if we if we

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,319
look at like you know the historical

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:56,009
context of everything that brought us to

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,599
where we are technology like no matter

00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,099
what you know the beeper King might have

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,189
said on 30 rock technology is not

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:05,789
cyclical but we do have trends that come

00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:07,649
and go and this you know like Bill joy

00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:10,139
saying the network is the computer we

00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:12,569
suddenly now are way less attached to

00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:15,119
like very specific physical machines

00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:17,839
that we keep in our data centers or that

00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:21,089
you know we possibly even have with us

00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,519
fun fact my laptop actually died in the

00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:28,830
Delta lounge at SFO on the way here

00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:30,539
so but because hey cloud and USB keys

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,729
I'm fine

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,740
there's when we're building out these

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:36,959
platforms I think there's a lot of

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,080
things that we need to consider around

00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,209
the architecture and this goes to I mean

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,300
what we were just hearing from Google

00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:47,490
about hey tying in to authentication

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,519
that you already have like stuff like

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:54,599
you a and copy is it's really important

00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:57,449
because we we all have built things in

00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,189
isolation and had them be just like you

00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:00,539
know magical and perfect until we tried

00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:02,999
to plug them into everything the

00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:05,069
business was already using because the

00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:06,509
reality is I mean for many of you know

00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,189
pivotal zenterprise customers out there

00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:10,409
I'm regularly talking to people who

00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,029
still have mainframes probably aren't

00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:15,809
turning it off tomorrow there's still

00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:18,119
business value there and so the idea of

00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:20,699
building things that are modular and can

00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:23,309
interoperate is I think a good way to

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,779
get people who may be resistant to like

00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:26,999
changes or the platform that you're

00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:28,229
introducing to understand that like hey

00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:32,519
they're gonna be able to plug their

00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:34,560
thing into all right um I think we get

00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,149
there's a you know we talked before

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,919
about tech trends and there's a lot of

00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:40,469
pendulum swings with tech trends right

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,599
now and I mean right now people are very

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,250
excited about micro services and that's

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,680
cool I mean you should probably

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,840
have micro-services you will the the

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,820
principle value that microservices may

00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,570
give you is changing what your debugging

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,660
process looks like if you're if you're

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,940
looking at I actually was in a

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,990
conference and in an open space talking

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,670
to somebody last year who said our vp

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,280
says we're going to have micro services

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,990
in fourth quarter help and I was like

00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,790
what problem are you trying to solve

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,130
because if the problem that you're

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,630
trying to solve is you need to be able

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,350
to deploy more consistently and

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,060
correctly

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,520
I mean maybe your VP should be looking

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,260
at platforms or maybe micro services are

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,910
fantastic but you're also going to need

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,280
to re architect a lot of things in order

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,630
to use them so like having those

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,970
conversations inside your organization

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,130
remember we still have humans in the

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,050
picture those humans have motivations

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,940
maybe they just want to own something

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,280
end-to-end that they can deploy without

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,660
arguing with anyone else like maybe

00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,490
that's what they're trying to do in

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,690
which case again like talking to them

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,630
about what they can do at the platform

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,160
is a little bit more useful again Micra

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,420
services excellent they just might not

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,620
solve the problem that they're actually

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:55,380
trying to solve in cloud way we're I'm

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,750
here in a Google track so I think I have

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,450
to say like obviously Google has a cloud

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,760
it's delightful clouds are a great

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:06,300
abstraction that prevent you principally

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:09,870
from having to worry about provisioning

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,700
the actual hardware however just because

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,300
something is in the cloud does not mean

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,580
that it is limitless or perfect and

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,830
having these discussions in terms of

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,260
like putting what kind of abstractions

00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,390
you're going to put in front of what

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,950
your end-users are using I'm guessing

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,540
because I put the word ops in the title

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,100
that some people with ops interests are

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,680
showing up for this and so like

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,020
strategically when people say just give

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,400
me my VMs it's like just push back with

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,830
what is it that you're trying to

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,290
accomplish oh you just want to be able

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:45,060
to scale up without talking to me we can

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:47,010
do that because this having to talk to

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,890
people thing is real like Conway's law

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,890
no I mean not really a law right more of

00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:55,920
a you know an axiom a maxima guideline

00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,329
whatever but commies law is basically

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,029
telling you that

00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:02,429
your org chart may say that you escalate

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,559
request through the VP of whatever but

00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:06,689
you're probably just gonna talk to Sarah

00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,040
because you know Sarah will help you and

00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:10,199
Sarah works in that department

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,499
like that's how communication actually

00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:15,269
works you know between people and the

00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,980
larger organizations get the more

00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:19,619
important it is that we're building

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,929
tooling you know including say platforms

00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:23,730
that allow proper delegation and all

00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:26,610
those taxes control and all the things

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,269
that make it possible to not trip over

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:33,749
communication hurdles you know between

00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:37,920
people because I do I want to believe

00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:39,689
that everybody is going to only deploy

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,809
thing you know code that actually works

00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:43,860
and you know nobody is gonna be paging

00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:44,939
me in the middle of the night like that

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,519
would be delightful

00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:49,170
no one pages me in the night now but

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,220
people page Jim in the middle of the

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:56,999
night and if and systems page more

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,579
importantly and the reason that we try

00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:02,249
to set you know guardrails of whatever

00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:04,019
sort whether it's let's not let somebody

00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:06,149
accidentally spend all the money or

00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,799
let's not let somebody accidentally blow

00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:09,959
up the world we try to set these

00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,910
guardrails because we're worried about

00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,399
resource constraints we're worried about

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,689
you know accidental probably not

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,279
malicious you would just take away their

00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:19,110
access if it was malicious but we're

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,379
worried about accidental you know

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,360
toppling over the world and I feel like

00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:27,179
this is again like when you're when

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,519
you're setting up your your constraints

00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:32,309
that do empower people because they

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,049
prevent people from needing to work

00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:36,569
every single detail out themselves

00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:40,350
I think that like the the cynical

00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:42,480
realities of ops life is the better the

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,399
well signed happy path that you can give

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,119
people works the more they're going to

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,889
use it you know this this is a you know

00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:53,040
classic like make the right thing the

00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:54,929
easy thing because you're otherwise

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,179
you're just gonna end up yak shaving and

00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:58,499
it'll be DNS problems and sadness and

00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:03,290
it's like is that what you really want

00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:05,970
probably not so I have to have to quote

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,649
uniquely Schaefer again here I like to

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,970
use this quote of his because he said

00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:09,640
this on the Cloud Foundry after-dark

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,580
podcast

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,070
a while back and this is a Gartner hype

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,870
cycle and it could you know this could

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,900
be a half a hype cycle for absolutely

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:22,090
anything that we want to talk about you

00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,340
know container orchestration why not but

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,830
I think that the important thing to

00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,530
consider here is that most of Tec is

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:31,930
tribal of tribalism in fashion mostly

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,790
people you know we go to talk to

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,490
customers and they always want to hear

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,140
about a story from their vertical it's

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,840
like you know the other verticals are

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,040
using computers to but but they want to

00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,830
hear the story from their vertical

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,570
because they want to know if people who

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,340
they perceive as being like them who

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,950
have their problems who are in their

00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,540
tribe are able to solve their problems

00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,500
with Cloud Foundry that's that's what

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,240
they want to know they don't want to

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,490
hear about people who they perceive as

00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,550
being not their tribe not like them and

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,840
so I think it's it's really that's one

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,250
of the really useful and important

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,690
things I think about coming to Cloud

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,640
Foundry summit just because you can meet

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,290
more people from your tribe and maybe

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,740
also expand just a little bit the

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:14,740
definition of what your tribe is and

00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,990
this is a I don't know if any of you

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,390
recall the the left pad incident but

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,270
this is I think one of those examples of

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,070
it's very easy to throw blame around

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,530
when you're operating things in

00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,260
production and someone else probably

00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:31,300
those NPM people or whatever somebody

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,130
else those front-end developers made a

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,680
terrible choice and now you have outages

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,840
and sadness but like the reality is if

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,950
you're tasked with operating something

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,170
in production and you might be a

00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:46,270
balanced team that also is developing

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,790
the application as you go there might be

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,500
handoffs inside your organization like I

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,700
mean I can't I can't dictate what your

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,640
charts gonna look like or your

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,470
responsibilities matrix or whatever your

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,110
racy chart may say that this is someone

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,210
else's problem but someone is going to

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,270
have to care about how stuff is

00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,530
operating in production and chances are

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,600
good that if you're coming to a talk

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,910
with this title it's probably you so

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,800
like this is owning your own

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:17,620
availability and figuring out what your

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,630
you know allowances are and where the

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,280
platform is going to allow you to give

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,440
people a lot of latitude

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,220
and where nothing will allow you to give

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,890
them a latitude super important this is

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,190
this is where the observability that you

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:35,530
can get by using any one of the many

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,990
choices from PCF metrics on you know on

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:42,910
out what any of these choices in the

00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:45,130
platform to have better visibility into

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,630
what's going on with your infrastructure

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,660
and into what's going on with the

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,580
applications is super useful so this is

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,620
again like technically tactically from

00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:56,370
the point of view of somebody who maybe

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,780
once they operated a bunch of you know

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,910
VMware and now they still operate some

00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,650
VMware but there's also like public

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,830
cloud stuff that things are bursting too

00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:07,630
and they're not exactly sure what their

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,790
job is and maybe it's gonna be very

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:14,050
different soon I would challenge you to

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,480
think that like scaling and telemetry

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,880
and observability of the overall

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,220
platform is probably your job at that

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,080
point so that's the stuff to focus on

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,910
you know asking they're answering those

00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,490
questions that you didn't even know how

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:30,280
to ask well I'll put a plug in there for

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,830
a honeycomb dot IO has a beta PCF tile

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:37,000
is worth looking at for this sort of

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:39,160
thing and this again it comes back to

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,870
the way you're going to handle the

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,960
handoffs and the communication between

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,730
teams like at pivotal for you know the

00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,130
escalations for the on-call process

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,589
there many teams are in the on-call

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,360
rotation for different services and like

00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:54,610
that's a model that many people find

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,710
valuable so that they're not sending all

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,660
alerts through people who maybe are just

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,460
going to act as a really angry named

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,589
pipe to send it to the developer who

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,470
they want to blame and be angry at like

00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:08,290
instead of that you know I'm not saying

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,480
make every single developer who

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,480
basically just knows how to write some

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,069
Java be on call for you know you're open

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,930
sack that's not what I'm saying but I'm

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,910
saying for things people are going to be

00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:23,290
the best one to answer have them be the

00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:26,199
first one to be asked and this is also I

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,270
think really important to and this is

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,900
that that human factor of communication

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:33,940
between teams to hang a sign on those

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,780
things that you know you probably want

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,240
to change

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,860
it's a known limitation maybe a few

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,200
people have even bumped up against it

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,750
and opened a ticket about it and you

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,880
still can't really change it yet but

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,440
also it's politically bad for you to

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,570
talk about this problem that you can't

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,890
change and it's like okay that's just

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,120
gonna waste a lot of people's time and

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,950
we've all had something in our

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,659
infrastructure like that that wastes a

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,370
lot of people's time just put out

00:17:55,659 --> 00:18:00,010
whatever kind of announcement you do and

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,539
say like this is our mediation plan but

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,909
for now these are things you need to

00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:07,240
know this was actually a glacier in

00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:11,049
Iceland I went hiking with my spouse and

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,580
and it said the attention natural hazard

00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,080
do not pass this point and that's

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,669
exactly where the guide was taking us

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,190
and I was like well at least they had a

00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:20,159
disclaimer we didn't die the glacier was

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,049
melting into our boots but we didn't die

00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:25,840
and this this kind of also like that

00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:28,450
idea of what to alert people to and what

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,760
to monitor on there's a lot of the old

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,590
style of monitoring that focused and you

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,600
know the the host check and the disk

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,640
check because those were things that

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,590
were easy to check and therefore easy to

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,270
tell you how they were doing but it's

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,770
like what does that actually tell you

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:45,970
about capacity or capabilities like what

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,580
does that tell you about what your

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,280
organization is suddenly not going to be

00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:55,210
able to do and the way that monitoring

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,760
is going these days is again like with a

00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:02,799
modern platform you can actually say hey

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:06,340
yes you can you can deploy yes we can

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,409
handle this amount of load depending on

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,059
whether you have auto scaling or you're

00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,620
doing manual scaling of the platform

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:13,900
like there's going to be differences

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,750
with how you handle you know any kind of

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:19,210
capacity issue but this is the sort of

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,010
thing where you can imagine and maybe

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,960
some of you remember like I do that

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,700
there used to be a whole thing with you

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,110
know procurement processes and purchase

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,350
orders before you could scale anything

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:31,510
up it's like okay we're past that but

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,280
are we to the point where people don't

00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,789
have to do quite so many handoffs

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,100
between teams like if you're trying to

00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:40,419
get something and there's getting things

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,130
from the infrastructure team and then

00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:44,890
getting firewall rules from the security

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,919
team and all of that like that is gonna

00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,600
make for a really difficult monitoring

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,950
troubleshooting and debugging process if

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,450
you're trying to figure out exactly

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,960
where the problem is so this is a I

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:01,360
think I also want to point out that

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:05,200
there's a lot of focus in developer

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,330
centric communications about day one

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,640
it's gonna be developer ready it's gonna

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:12,370
be easy to use we're gonna get this out

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,399
there and that is all great but day one

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:17,740
is really short and day two is probably

00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:20,409
forever and you're going to have stuff

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,030
in production a lot longer than that

00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:28,179
initial exciting rollout that you had a

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:30,909
party about so having the the focus

00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:35,169
inside your organization to allow you to

00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:37,090
configure and you know maintain your

00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:39,460
Cloud Foundry installations such that

00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,260
you aren't going to put undue burden on

00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:45,340
the humans who are still part of this

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:48,549
equation super important I also want to

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,200
put a reality check about like attack

00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:52,570
kitten got bigger by the way that's what

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,080
happens when you feed them but reality

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,659
check about it's very easy for me to

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,159
stand on a stage and say you should and

00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:01,090
it's very easy for you to go to a

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,480
meeting and give somebody

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:07,030
recommendations and it's not easy at all

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,710
to make sure everyone who needs to

00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,570
follow through and to make sure that all

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,710
the stakeholders actually can be brought

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,169
to some sort of agreement

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,330
ah this is that human stuff this is

00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:18,220
really sticky is sticky widgets and

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,840
they're it's hard and I don't know about

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,130
you but I had a computer science degree

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,440
because I didn't want to talk to people

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,880
and apparently I made terrible life

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,789
choices at some point and so here I am

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,440
but like it turns out we all have to

00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:33,250
talk to and interact with other people

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,799
and have some degree of empathy and

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,159
understanding for why they want the

00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:41,500
clearly wrong things that they want and

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,179
how we can convince them that they want

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,640
the clearly right things that we want

00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:48,429
like this is actually you know

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,260
protip life hacks that we all need in

00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:51,820
order to get the things that we need and

00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,950
we want you know inside our

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,149
organizations just can take a look at

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,830
how I'm doing on time I'm doing

00:21:55,149 --> 00:22:00,520
delightfully on time this is great

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,420
okay so alright so you're here you're

00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,370
like okay

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,320
really cute pictures to your cats but

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:07,150
we're here at a tech conference why are

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,920
we not talking about specific tools I

00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:12,490
did warn you there was no code or live

00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:14,890
demos here but I also think tools are a

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,550
little bit beyond beside the point like

00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:20,410
they are really important you're you can

00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:22,600
hold hands and sing Kumbaya and not

00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:25,300
really be developing at all if you don't

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,540
have tools that actually work so they do

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,610
matter they're just not going to solve

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,080
the problem by themselves I mean even

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,210
Cloud Foundry as delightful as it is

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,760
isn't going to solve all of the problems

00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,490
inside your organization where people

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,910
are resisting change or where people

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:46,150
would prefer to build something that is

00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,590
their you know their baby and they do

00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,810
not want you to tell them their baby is

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,220
ugly and you're like your baby is

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,910
beautiful I just don't want to maintain

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:57,670
it it's like yeah exactly

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:59,710
so I think this is where like the the

00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:02,860
classic and it doesn't just have to be

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,690
developers and operations I mean this is

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,510
the Android Schafer's classic wall of

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,160
confusion but I like to think of it a

00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,370
little bit I remix this one a little bit

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:15,640
I think of it more as like team Yolo and

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,140
team nope and this has to do with how

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,500
the incentives are set up inside the

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:23,590
organization right so if there is a team

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,410
that is celebrated when they ship things

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,760
that are exciting and then they wash

00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,980
their hands of it and they go and they

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,680
do something else exciting that's really

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,630
super for them and the people who get

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,600
paged on that exciting stuff when it

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:39,460
hits corner cases hate them and would

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,890
like to say no to their new exciting

00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,330
ideas and if there's I see a couple

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,640
people nodding and if this happens

00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,990
inside your organization think about how

00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,720
the incentives look inside your

00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,220
organization like if your again this is

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,630
this is not something you can solve with

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,770
Cloud Foundry but this is something you

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,850
can solve by thinking about what

00:23:53,770 --> 00:24:00,220
motivates people if people are you know

00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:02,320
having the release party while someone

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,910
else is dealing with the data center

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,830
burning down like that's not going to

00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,720
lead to happy inner team communication

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,000
and it's also not going to lead to

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,860
everyone being excited about the next

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,190
release I mean some people might be but

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:17,650
probably not everyone so like some

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:22,540
specific actionable things and again

00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:24,130
this is this is very very simplistic I'm

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,840
just breaking it down to like people who

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,370
are primarily tasked with operating

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,960
things and people who are primarily

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,720
tasked with feature you know new feature

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,160
development that doesn't mean that no

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,700
one bleeds over between the two

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:39,370
obviously most people do by I would say

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,470
it's really important not to just say

00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,090
drop some devs into your on-call

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,160
rotation and be like good luck have fun

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,960
and then they get paged um they're

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,460
really sad and they hate you and since

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,820
that doesn't actually make it easier

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:56,860
better but if you have good automation

00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:00,160
everywhere that you've you know made

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,730
some Vash choices you checked all of

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,390
that into version control right maybe

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,310
everything has to go through a version

00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:09,820
control even to get released hopefully

00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:13,620
you don't have like I think a lot of

00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:16,450
people do have those few things that are

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:19,330
really only known to the people who do

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:21,250
it the most frequently and that's that

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:25,000
does not democratize the observer

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:27,790
ability it also doesn't lead to better

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,430
sharing and this doesn't mean like you

00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:32,350
have to sit there and write write

00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,330
documentation whatever that means no one

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,980
wants to write documentation but you

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,370
probably could write a reason on the

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:42,760
commit message like Minimum Viable

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:44,890
documentation and then for for people

00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,870
who are developing those features that

00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,830
are essential and necessary and really

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,540
important and are making the

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:52,570
organization money or helping it reaches

00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:54,550
a non-financial goals I would say it's

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:58,390
really important to think about the

00:25:54,550 --> 00:26:01,840
operability of your software because

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:04,030
your software is going to do exactly

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,380
what you wrote it to do probably some

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,480
other things that you didn't expect it

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,100
to do and you're gonna have an awful lot

00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,190
of inputs that don't look like your

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,590
ideal test cases and so like I think

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,600
that seems so basic but they're how many

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,250
bugs do we wrote we all run into where

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,430
it's like oh I didn't think this would

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,380
happen well I mean again that's what

00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:25,630
your automated and then manual testing

00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,310
is for but you know your exploratory

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,820
testing is really valuable for finding

00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:33,110
the things that know

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:34,550
surely no one will yes they will but

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,510
having good tooling around your

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:40,880
observability and your debug ability

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,290
again like this you're when you're when

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,730
you're implementing your platform think

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,380
about where you're gonna send your

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,360
locker Gator like you're probably going

00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,580
to send it to one or more places what

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,730
kind of problems can people solve with

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,250
the data there and then I also just have

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,690
reality in here because I don't know

00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,850
about you but I've definitely worked

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,190
with really optimistic developers and

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,960
I'm a cynical realist because I'm an ops

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,900
person at heart but I've worked with

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,000
optimistic developers who everything was

00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,490
the happy case it's like well I mean the

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,410
happy path the ideal case where nothing

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,050
goes wrong is mostly what they focus on

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,850
and it's like well you know if you have

00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,710
an endpoint that returns 200 ok

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,840
literally that's what it does like it

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,180
just returns 200 ok all the time no

00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,800
matter what else is going on you're

00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,540
right that instance is never going to

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,610
get thrown over the edge of the AWS load

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,980
balancer like you did solve that problem

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:34,100
you may not have solved any other

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,140
problems but real like real life I have

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,950
actually run into that and I was like oh

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:43,150
that's you know that endpoint is not

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:45,590
it's not operating in reality so and

00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,850
something else too and we I know we've

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,740
heard in some of the keynotes and

00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:53,150
whatnot a little bit about this but like

00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:55,490
the the human factors of it's easy to

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:57,920
say that you're distributed systems

00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,480
problems are basically just like cache

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,100
invalidation and naming things and

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,350
off-by-one errors you know there's a lot

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,360
of great jokes about that but I would

00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:09,250
actually say the the main one that I

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,740
think is a real problem in computers is

00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:14,420
the fact that humans we get really

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:17,360
attached to our ideas I mean I know I

00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:21,050
get really attached to my ideas and we

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,900
get really upset when someone else

00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:26,000
doesn't see things our way and I think

00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,970
it's it's really important to remember

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,800
that the other people who are clearly

00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,930
wrong and are making choices that are

00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,360
making us very frustrated are still

00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:38,120
people and they have motivations just

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,750
like us and so we have to work with them

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,330
like we we

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,460
can't use the abstractions that make our

00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,140
lives a lot easier to shut them out of

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,110
our lives entirely because as it turns

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:53,460
out those abstractions are kind of leaky

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:55,950
so I mean like for example at pivotal we

00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,620
are you know a worldwide company and we

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:01,590
do a lot of collaboration over you know

00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,000
internet-based tools and this was

00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,430
actually envisioned it's kind of funny

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,760
this is a French some French magazine

00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:11,730
art from 1890 where they have an artist

00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,980
rendition of like you know video call

00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,900
where the audio is clearly having

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,750
problems and the people are you know

00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:22,790
dropping off of the the call I feel like

00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:25,710
we we have a lot of places where we've

00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:28,200
imagined or envisioned what the future

00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,510
is going to be like what how people are

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,310
gonna use the tools we're creating how

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,420
people are going to use how end-users

00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,580
are going to use things how our

00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,720
collaborators and co-workers on

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,090
open-source projects are gonna use

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,250
things we have a lot of these visions of

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,960
the future that you know that's the near

00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,790
future the next week future not the

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,460
hundred years in the future we have a

00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:50,340
lot of those visions that turn out to be

00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:53,100
sort of right I mean in retrospect like

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,260
this is this is sort of right and it's

00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,060
completely wrong this is not actually

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,770
what the year 2000 was like from my

00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:02,030
recollection at least I mean maybe I

00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:06,390
don't know but yeah I was on call for

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:08,760
for y2k and December 31st 1999 so

00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:11,610
perhaps in my recollection of 2000s a

00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,360
little little hazy but but this idea

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:17,430
that we can't always know what the

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,030
future is going to be like but we can

00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:23,580
try to set up structures and processes

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,410
and tools that will help us with what we

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:29,040
know is going we know there's going to

00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:30,750
be change because I think and this is

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,760
this is another quote from Schaffer I

00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,040
just I could just do an entire talk

00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,840
that's all Schaefer tweets hmm this is a

00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,330
challenge for the future

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,310
but what he's saying here is the

00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,560
software industry is stuck on deployment

00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,990
but we desperately need to be looking at

00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,750
architecture and telemetry which is

00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:51,480
another way of putting that is day one

00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,500
is short day two goes on for a really

00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,480
long time we need to run this stuff

00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:00,280
production a lot longer than we need to

00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:02,740
see it working because this is I think

00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,330
there's a lot of and again I have

00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,690
nothing against developers some of my

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:09,850
best friends are developers but and I

00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,880
know I'm running a tiny bit long but in

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,950
a world that is saying go out there and

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,880
ship your app it's like that's awesome

00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:21,460
is that app going to like write data

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,860
somewhere maybe you need to collect user

00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:27,760
information provide value in some sort

00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:29,590
of way that matters so this is that's

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,050
basically what I see is like the whole

00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,550
thing behind DevOps is we're all going

00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:37,180
to collaborate to make this sort of

00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:39,190
thing possible and that's it I'm a with

00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,810
pivotal where we've got spring one

00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,040
platform in December you can come to

00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,670
that if you want to talk more about this

00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:49,359
stuff otherwise thank you so much

00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:49,359
