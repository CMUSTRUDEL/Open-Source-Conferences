Google Microsoft feels like there's

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,089
something missing

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,610
all right should I should I believe the

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,340
chair for the other provider this is

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,750
other cloud right yeah what's the deal

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,980
with that why is well I'm saving him a

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:20,850
seat somebody from a running light here

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:26,310
who wants to come up and welcome you up

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:29,010
here anybody with an AWS account Devin

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:33,390
you got Prime membership right you

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,250
qualify your call thanks for being your

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,960
guys why don't you just briefly

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,180
introduce yourself and tell us what you

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,550
do in the context of Cloud Foundry right

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,350
my name is KY Shana Madison

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,680
I run the enterprise open source group

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,690
at Microsoft or we do a bunch of stream

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,510
projects one of which obviously is Cloud

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,520
Foundry my team is also responsible for

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,120
making sure that to the next runs well

00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,480
on various Microsoft platforms including

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,210
geysers given that a lot of the open

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,070
source projects are born on Linux the

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,880
work that we do in making Linux run well

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,229
on hyper-v is the foundational piece for

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,460
projects such as Cloud Foundry to run

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,470
well on our platforms I'm Eric Johnson I

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,850
lead an engineering team working on open

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,740
source integrations for Google cloud

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,110
platform and we've been working in the

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,470
cloud foundry community for over a year

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,770
now I'm chip Childers my job is to run

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,340
over in Mike you know any drives uber or

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,250
doing a spirit yeah so we're here to

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,259
talk about multi cloud and I'm really

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,189
interested in what you are doing to help

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:46,020
your customers make that make that

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,280
progression to multi-class right multi

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,500
cloud means different things to

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,290
different people right one is the

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,840
ability to deploy workloads on different

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,689
clouds different public clouds and Cloud

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,500
Foundry the wonderful mechanism to make

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,780
that happen

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,100
we support cloud foundry and the goal

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,860
there is to make sure that we don't

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,390
deviate in our implementation of Cloud

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,489
Foundry so that workloads that are

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,229
deployed and Azure

00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:11,519
could just go over and run elsewhere as

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,829
well

00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:15,959
and for somebody like Microsoft that

00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:19,590
actually has had a long history with

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,500
enterprise customers multi-cloud also

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,219
means hybrid cloud meaning we want to

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,930
bridge the gap between on-prem cloud

00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,519
infrastructures to public cloud

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,709
infrastructures so we do have offerings

00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,549
on the on print side like the azure

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:42,150
stack so we have Cloud Foundry enabled

00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:46,650
on Azure stack as well so the entire

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:48,389
spectrum of both private clouds as well

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,700
as public clouds is addressed in our

00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:52,409
multi cloud strategy once the azure

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,560
stack is actually available to everybody

00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:58,129
well we've had previous effort going out

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,389
sometime to see a little being available

00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:00,840
Eric what's your definition of multi

00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,939
cloud

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,000
yeah I think it's a you know obviously

00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:08,250
it's about customer choice right I think

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,079
that Cloud Foundry is a great way to

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,689
abstract a lot of the differences from

00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,950
cloud providers what I think is also

00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:15,510
very important in a Cloud Foundry

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,970
ecosystem is that you still have the

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,459
capability to utilize platform

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,220
differentiators through the open service

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,260
broker API and service broker model but

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,639
you're still abstracting away a lot of

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,010
the complexities that you probably don't

00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,900
necessarily care about right so you

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,959
could have Foundation's running on Azure

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,049
or Amazon or Google and still take

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,430
advantage of platform differentiators

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:42,959
yeah yeah I think it's an interesting

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:46,259
buzzword but putting in all honesty I

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,109
think it represents what's a hard

00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,209
reality of Tranter price right but we

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:52,530
can we can use whatever word we want to

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,879
use because it used to be hybrid cloud

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,560
and then there was you know then we had

00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,180
this cloud bursting thing which turns

00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,979
out isn't really a thing and now we're

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,500
talking about multi cloud but what it

00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,819
actually means is that those two dudes

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,979
enterprise environments are complicated

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,650
right you're going to want to place your

00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,669
applications in in public clouds if that

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,220
makes the most sense you're going to

00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:12,479
want to do it in hopefully agile local

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,189
infrastructure when that makes sense

00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,859
right and I think it's just more of a

00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:19,709
way to step back and accept complexity

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,659
in in particular Geographic and location

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,530
complexity and then and then service

00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:24,300
variants

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,010
between these environments is that

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,420
something you're actually seeing your

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:33,150
customers do yes the cloud journey has

00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,520
started and we need to make sure that

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,790
we're bringing along everybody that had

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,460
a significant investment in their legacy

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,370
applications tax and infrastructure so

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:48,030
that's the the the intention to bring

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:50,130
our existing customers over to the cloud

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,850
and I just as I mentioned earlier we

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,990
field is a bridge to that journey and

00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,780
then you know born in the cloud

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:02,130
customers they want choice they want

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:05,720
choice and Microsoft is all about choice

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:08,070
these days and Microsoft also

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,860
traditionally has made the complex

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:14,060
simple now my grandmother could would

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:19,020
read email because Microsoft or Frank

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,380
right so that simplicity is what Cloud

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,090
Foundry offers being able to deploy

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,430
workloads complex workloads on different

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,400
infrastructures yeah we definitely

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:32,220
worked on architectures with customers

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,960
that have an on-premise Cloud Foundry

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,560
and they're looking at expanding out

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,400
into the cloud right so as they start to

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,590
you know feel much more comfortable

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,020
moving to public cloud they don't want

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,450
to continue to make investments in data

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,070
center capacity they're looking at how

00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,690
do they continue to use Cloud Foundry

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,690
where they're already using that on Prem

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,490
and then start using cloud right so

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,130
Cloud Foundry again allows them to

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,919
bridge that gap and we've you know been

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,060
working on architectures that

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,190
take advantage of a lot of like Google's

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,630
infrastructure how we service you know

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,340
Gmail and YouTube and stuff like that

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,990
making that available to Cloud Foundry

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,430
users I think there's going to be some

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,070
interesting use cases coming up in

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,600
keynotes later in the conference talking

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,160
about you know the use of different

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,370
public cloud providers

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,470
I mean frequently we talk about you know

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,010
your first thought is this you start

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,450
private then you kind of go public

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,950
but public cloud adoption has already

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,870
reached the stage where now we're

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:34,260
starting to say I'm using more than one

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,030
right I'm gonna use Microsoft or some

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,560
I'm gonna use Google for others and

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,480
still gonna possibly have an on-prem

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,280
OpenStack deployment or vSphere or

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,420
VMware photon deployment and I think

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,090
that's you know that we're gonna

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,320
increasingly see that the other thing we

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,270
seem to be seeing more as people

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,880
starting out in the cloud and then going

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,920
rocket because it's sometimes cheaper

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,330
for them to do that - yeah I mean the

00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,150
biggest lie you can tell yourself is the

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,110
public cloud is a cost reduction right I

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:03,030
mean it's just not true

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,260
oh you are I don't know I don't know if

00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,730
you ever search use it the proofs about

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:11,520
Laura's I think I've got them all I mean

00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,960
it's about agility it's not about you

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,400
know operational excited I mean total

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,440
cost of ownership is gonna be lower yes

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,120
but you're gonna spend you're gonna

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,010
spend money for each thing that you're

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,660
using and you are all are gonna fight it

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,800
out on price and quality and you know

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,320
there's a there's a way to kind of

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,480
measure that but but it is in many ways

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,490
more expensive than going to buy one

00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,160
server and then advertising that over

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,510
however many years right right but you

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,610
have to buy that server and wait for the

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,410
truck to show up with it so I think the

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,970
the other advantage I think you know

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,590
standardizing on Cloud Foundry it's not

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,570
just about technology or abstracting

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,180
away the infrastructure it's also the

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,650
expertise of the team you know you've

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,930
got the new developer program out there

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,400
that just launched recently right so you

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,920
have developers that are learning how to

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,700
use effectively many different clouds

00:07:52,920 --> 00:08:00,180
with a single abstraction yeah we hope

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:02,640
that that's powerful when when they're

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:06,390
making their choice though which clouds

00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,520
to use there is something that it's call

00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,830
it service gravity right if I'm using

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,250
already a bunch of Microsoft or Google

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,740
or AWS services I probably want to be

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,960
close to those right do you see that as

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,630
an advantage is a disadvantage for you

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,560
right so we talked about how Cloud

00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:28,610
Foundry and what strikes the platforms

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,320
and gives a uniform runtime for

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,980
applications what applications don't run

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:38,220
in isolation right they need to consume

00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:40,920
services and Microsoft has a rich set of

00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,600
service offerings that have been used by

00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,710
enterprise customers for quite some time

00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:51,930
so we believe now the cloud choice often

00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:54,590
is made not just on surprise and other

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,660
tangible differentiates as well also

00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:00,570
what is the ecosystem right and how

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:04,290
close the dqo system match with what

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:07,290
they're already used to in their on-prem

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,590
world yes I do believe that the

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,640
ecosystem has a great bearing on the

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:16,250
choice

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,250
most people don't run Google on premise

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,200
that would be cool though

00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,350
do you have a product announcement you

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:27,390
wanna make know okay GCP stack is coming

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:38,820
yeah in a docker image the container

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:41,910
yeah you can tell we rehearse great

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,340
disadvantage for you no I don't think so

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,540
I think you know again with the cloud

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,790
foundry right you can run that anywhere

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,890
so yes service gravity right would is

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,450
probably something that you know you

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,340
would want to take advantage of so if

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,980
you're using an azure service or GCP

00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,560
service you definitely have a foundation

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,230
nearby right but it doesn't it doesn't

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,170
still require that you're just locked in

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,880
on a single key rider right it just may

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,410
be for the sets of applications you

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,120
would do your application deployments in

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,460
that particular foundation that utilizes

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,290
those services but you could just as

00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,150
easily use spanner where you've got some

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,280
maybe vendor lock-in with GCP and you've

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,440
got a foundation there again your

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,360
developers are being able to do CF push

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,000
to applications depending on where they

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,340
need access to those services if service

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,380
gravity is important to them I've

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,140
actually got a question for both both of

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,670
you and both of your organization's have

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:37,200
had a pretty interesting relationship

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:39,180
with open-source and in the past but but

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,190
you're you're increasing the engagement

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,630
in in these communities I mean at a

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,060
really high velocity right both of you

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,260
it's an amazing work so can you just

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,340
tell us a little bit more about what

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,930
that means to know what that means to

00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,660
Google what that means to Microsoft and

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:54,210
you know and your customers right I

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,450
think I'll jump in first on us and I

00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,370
think for Google right I mean all of

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,410
Google is built

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,320
top of open source right every server

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,390
that we have runs Linux every developer

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,040
workstation runs some form of Unix

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,080
whether that's even Mac right and it's

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,670
basically UNIX under the hood every

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,110
engineer at Google knows how to use set

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,000
and grab and all of these things right

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,880
it's all open source has been since day

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,350
one and we care a lot about making sure

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,450
that we're giving back to that community

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,880
right so you know obviously some of the

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,890
contributions that we've made you know

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,260
see groups back to enable containers in

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,089
the first place from Android operating

00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,820
system right all of this stuff is links

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,339
based you know participating into

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,779
standards bodies all of those things are

00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:42,410
incredibly important to Google's

00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:45,740
business oh the Microsoft journey into

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,529
open source has been more recent and

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:52,480
again it's really based on choice and

00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:55,070
with these customers asking us to

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,460
support them in the choices they're made

00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,290
right if somebody wants to run an open

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:04,100
source stack as part of their

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,600
application as part of their workload we

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,480
want to make sure that our platform can

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,640
support it as best as we can right and

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,950
we also see value in the open source

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,290
development model tooling that's there

00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:18,770
for instance just about a couple of

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,839
months ago all of the Windows kernel

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:25,190
development moved from our own

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,830
proprietary repos to use gate ok we saw

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:31,430
that you know gate was a better tool for

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:33,740
managing source and so we moved 2530

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:38,529
years of history back from our repos to

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:40,459
to get so we participate in open source

00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:43,550
projects in one of three different ways

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:46,160
but one is we participate in a large

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,470
project we continue to that platform for

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,550
each one of that Linux kernel is another

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:54,680
example of that we also are the owners

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,870
of some open source projects dotnet for

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,850
instance we open source that and we are

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,880
the main maintainer of that project and

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,680
lastly we use open source tools

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,170
internally to make our own development

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,270
more agile so forints

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,890
open source has been

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:15,200
you know has brought it back to our core

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,640
developer focused company that the world

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,650
to begin with right so this is a

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,130
different way of doing things and

00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:25,490
certainly is something that you know how

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:28,130
people are very happy about fact within

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:31,120
Microsoft there are about 15,000 victim

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:35,090
becomes you know people are just

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,700
developing software and using open

00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:40,640
source software to build products within

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,820
Microsoft I particularly like the the

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,320
point you made there about the the focus

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,660
on the really the developer experience

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,640
and taking some of you know the open

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:53,150
source approach to software engineering

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,280
like in that honestly it's it's not

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,020
freezing free software right it's I mean

00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,480
we're all doing this to to affect

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,130
outcomes but and in the case of you know

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,570
the end user organizations here is to

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,800
affect outcomes for their business that

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,260
might have nothing to do with technology

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,550
but it's enabling it and in you know the

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,810
kid some technology vendors it's of

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,000
course it's to service your customers

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,700
and make sure the babe what they need

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,200
that's great well all chip goes totally

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,890
off topic here right now let's bring it

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,240
back to boundary for a moment what is it

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,040
you actually doing between you talk

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,780
about the developer experience is it

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,400
what are you actually doing to enhance

00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,820
the developer experience for Cloud

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:31,190
Foundry developers well the support of

00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,260
Cloud Foundry on Azure we expect it to

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,720
be second to none meaning you know it's

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,770
it's going to be a first-rate experience

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,710
for people that want to develop Cloud

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:44,810
Foundry based workload for Ashes and

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:48,470
that says it all really yeah nothing

00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:51,500
specific but we make sure that all of

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:56,060
the the most up-to-date Cloud Foundry

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:58,040
bits are supported on items I think I

00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,330
guess I would say same thing right

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,910
saying all right we want to be sort of

00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,780
the best public cloud provider right

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,520
some of the things that we're done to

00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,690
try and differentiate ourselves is you

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,030
know utilizing a lot of Google's

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,250
infrastructure innovations you know our

00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,660
global load balancers right single IP

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,040
address all over the planet right you

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,360
did the closest foundation you don't

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,530
have to do any setup other things like

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,150
wiring in your logging and monitoring

00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,010
right so you're you're taking all of

00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,690
your application

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,240
and operator logs and putting that into

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:28,089
our stack driver logging tool you can

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,949
tie into electric debugger so that's in

00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,170
we're putting agents into the build

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,850
packs for that so you can actually live

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,940
debug your applications that are running

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,440
on top of Cloud Foundry on GC P so just

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,779
trying to make those innovations

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,779
available to cloud foundry users on GTV

00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:45,430
did those once I do that though once

00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,519
I've built all those monitoring tools

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,579
into my processes I'm not that likely to

00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:55,660
move away from from your cloud am I you

00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:57,570
could okay a lot more work I think that

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,610
goes back to your topic about you know

00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,810
Service sort of gravity right but

00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,060
there's nothing that would preclude you

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,740
from being able to do that and even you

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,510
know we have customers that are using

00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,060
that today on Prem they're still

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,440
ingesting their logs in the stack driver

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,480
and they're doing that from on-prem

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,459
Cloud Foundry funding but that's also an

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,690
area where we have tried to add value to

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,910
the cloud for you know Cloud Foundry

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,730
infrastructure we do have a fairly

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,519
extensive log analytics that's backed by

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:27,310
machine learning India and all that so

00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,750
we have plugged that infrastructure with

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,389
Cloud Foundry so that we can actually

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,790
reason about the logs and give some

00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:39,130
recommendations to Cloud Foundry users

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:40,990
on our platforms what about if when

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:43,930
you're seeing people move to to

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,790
multi-cloud setups what are some of the

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,310
mistakes they make that maybe the people

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,949
in the audience here can avoid and learn

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:53,680
from you not using clone fold with

00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:58,690
patterns perhaps it may not give you the

00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:02,410
dollar that's it well you know as long

00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:06,309
as they restrict themselves to the best

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,169
practices as laid out in the cloud form

00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:12,040
tree patterns I think they'll be in a

00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:13,809
good shape yeah I think it's it's really

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,309
I think that the best thing that you

00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:16,720
could do to take advantage of multi

00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:20,110
cloud is to use something like cloud

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,429
foundry right go after the things that

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,809
you care about on the platform but

00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:24,520
otherwise the rest of the stuff you just

00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,510
kind of abstract away so that you don't

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,690
really have to learn all of those

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,220
idiosyncrasies you know every every you

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,600
know major cloud provider has a virtual

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,159
machine as a service but they're all a

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,140
little bit different and why would you

00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:36,210
want to have to go through

00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,860
remember like these parameters for this

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,500
or these parameters for that you just

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,760
let Bosch take care of that for you and

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,980
then just focus on developing your

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,010
applications that's the best multi-cloud

00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,410
strategy I think yeah I'm sure chip will

00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,120
agree with that absolutely I have

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,780
nothing that in a great job I will be

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,970
paying later Oh later that's right you

00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,510
end up seeing any anybody just screwing

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:05,550
up though I'm not gonna talk about it

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:07,680
very nuff no well I mean the Frederick

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,190
let's be honest it is hard to make the

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,950
dark attentional choices right but but

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,570
it's not any different really you you've

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,680
got the same set of criteria and your

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,110
thought process around you know

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,760
availability resiliency you know we're

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,250
how are you gonna store your data how

00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,020
you gonna insure it all of those same

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,450
things that we used to think about when

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,970
we were racking and stack and yeah you

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,910
know the the hardware in our own closets

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,320
and calling it a data center right all

00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,990
of those same problems that you have to

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,170
think about when when you start spanning

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:43,830
across multiple clouds the the

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:46,890
complexity doesn't go away but you have

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,870
more tools available to you to to solve

00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,910
those problems right and you can rely

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,320
more on the service providers so for

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,480
example you know you need to back up

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,340
your data and yeah we you should

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,260
probably just use the native service for

00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,310
backing it up for the various clouds you

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,860
know that you're the urban structures

00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,520
aren't right because that's it's not a

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,780
value-added thing that even your

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:10,140
platform Operations Group should be

00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:13,230
focused on what what's looking ahead a

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,750
little bit what but it's still needed

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:19,140
what what do you still want to to build

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:21,750
into the platform to enable easier multi

00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:27,030
cloud deployments for example that

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:28,590
something you're thinking about what I'm

00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:33,270
seeing is the platform's

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:35,220
are evolving and raising the bar a lot

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,410
of things that washed it for instance

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,440
are going to be part of the underlying

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,220
platform moving forward and that journey

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,780
is going to continue

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,360
you know the platform is going to do

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,730
more and more things

00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,059
with regards to availability and scaling

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:52,519
and load balancing and all that and so

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:55,730
why they quite have made sense in the

00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,320
past to have that the value add on top

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,279
of the platform we need to figure out a

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,630
way where we can have a flexible way of

00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:05,929
leveraging what the platform has to

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:09,080
offer in building this higher level

00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:10,100
orchestration engines ya know if if all

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,559
the cloud providers could just

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,820
synchronize your release schedules there

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,460
be really helpful because then the

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:20,029
abstractions would evolve together but

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,340
but I think that the points where you

00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:26,000
interface in the platform have to allow

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:28,130
yes for that journey to occur at our

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,539
pace right we all are not going to do

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,820
the same thing at the same time right

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,370
but we should be able to say ok this

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,409
platform provides that let's use it it's

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,870
not we'll build up something that the

00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:40,490
desert I think I had an interesting

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:44,269
conversation last night with dimitri

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,980
about this talking about how Basch the

00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:47,179
way that i look at it today like if

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,559
you're setting up cloud foundry on top

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,750
of a provider there's a certain set of

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,820
infrastructure you need to create wash

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,250
takes care of disks and VMs for you but

00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,789
they're at least other things left as

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,289
out-of-band you know I could see a kind

00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,929
of a future where Bosch is starting to

00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:04,850
do a lot of that extra stuff for you and

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,380
then making that even easier to abstract

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:10,279
away some of the platform differences

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,779
where Bosch is handling a lot more not

00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:13,070
that he signed up for any of that I

00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:15,980
should say right it was just a

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:18,139
conversation but that's why we're here

00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,269
to have great conversations about great

00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:22,820
conversations yes and that wraps up that

00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:24,889
great conversation thank you very much

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:29,980
thank you for it in Japan thank you all

00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:29,980
