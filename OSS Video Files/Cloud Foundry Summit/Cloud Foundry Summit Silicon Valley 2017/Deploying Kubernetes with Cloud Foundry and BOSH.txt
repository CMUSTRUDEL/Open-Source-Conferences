Description: 
	Deploying Kubernetes with Cloud Foundry and BOSH [I] - Jeff Johnson and Meaghan Kjelland, Google    

In this talk, Meaghan and Jeff will show you how to run and manage Kubernetes with Cloud Foundry and BOSH. This is made possible by a joint collaboration between Pivotal and Google on an open source BOSH release of Kubernetes. Weâ€™ll go over the architecture, deployment, and value of the platforms alongside one another.

Meaghan Kjelland
Meaghan is a Software Engineer at Google taking the steam out of proprietary software by building the future in open source. She is currently working with Pivotal to make Kubernetes' container orchestration strengths complement Cloud Foundry applications.

Jeff Johnson
Jeff is a Software Engineer at Google who is giving developers super powers by integrating the tools that run Google with open source Cloud Foundry. He has worked closely with the excellent engineers at Pivotal on the stackdriver-tools BOSH release to integrate Google's Logging, Monitoring, Tracing, and Debugging with Cloud Foundry. Today he is working with Pivotal on bringing Kubernetes' container orchestration strengths to complement Cloud Foundry applications. Check out the Pivotal Cloud Foundry on Google Cloud Platform web series for a hint of what's to come.
