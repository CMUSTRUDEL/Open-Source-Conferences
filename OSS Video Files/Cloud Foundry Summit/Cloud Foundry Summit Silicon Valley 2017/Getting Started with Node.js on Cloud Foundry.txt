Description: 
	Getting Started with Node.js on Cloud Foundry [B] - Joe Doyle & Patrick Mueller, NodeSource    

Node.js is the fastest growing runtime used in Cloud Foundry. If youâ€™re just getting started with building Node.js applications for Cloud Foundry, you may have a lot of questions about best practices for this runtime environment. How can you test an application locally? Should you push your package dependencies, or let the staging machine download them? Should you be pushing your Node.js applications as Docker containers? How do you deal with private packages? How do you debug your application?

This presentation will cover these questions and more, by building a new Node.js application designed to be run in Cloud Foundry. Existing Node.js developers will probably learn a trick or two as well!
