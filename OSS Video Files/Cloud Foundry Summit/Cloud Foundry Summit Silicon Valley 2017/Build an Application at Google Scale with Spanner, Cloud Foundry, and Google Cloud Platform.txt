Description: 
	Build an Application at Google Scale with Spanner, Cloud Foundry, and Google Cloud Platform [I] - Jeff Johnson, Google    

Google runs on Spanner, the global scale database that allows our product teams to focus on building incredible products and our infrastructure teams to focus on delivering database that's consistent, highly-available (5 9's), and tolerant to network partitions. This innovation is now in your Cloud Foundry marketplace as Google Cloud Spanner through the GCP Service Broker. Join Google Engineers as they build a ticketing application on Cloud Foundry and see how simple it is push to data centers across the world and achieve Google scale without handling replication, sharding, network splits, or the rest of long tail of problems that comes with managing state across the planet.

Jeff is a Software Engineer at Google who is giving developers super powers by integrating the tools that run Google with open source Cloud Foundry. He has worked closely with the excellent engineers at Pivotal on the stackdriver-tools BOSH release to integrate Google's Logging, Monitoring, Tracing, and Debugging with Cloud Foundry. Today he is working with Pivotal on bringing Kubernetes' container orchestration strengths to complement Cloud Foundry applications.
