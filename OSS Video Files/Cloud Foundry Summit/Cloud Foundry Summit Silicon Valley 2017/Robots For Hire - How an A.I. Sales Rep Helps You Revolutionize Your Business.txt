In this session we'll show you how we've built a company delivering turnkey chat services that integrates seamlessly into your website. It even uses your industry lingo to answer common customer questions, sell your product, and convert visitors into leads. As a startup, easy to use cloud services and unlimited scalability matters, which is why we've built our application on Cloud Foundry with Node.js. We’re using socket.io to enable real-time live chat that is integrated with Watson’s cognitive system. With a firebase database, an angular front end app, and express.js for distribution, we'll take you through our thought process, from development, to results, and success.
