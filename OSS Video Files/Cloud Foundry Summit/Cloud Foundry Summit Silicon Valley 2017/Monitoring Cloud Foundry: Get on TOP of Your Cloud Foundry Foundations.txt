	Monitoring Cloud Foundry: Get on TOP of Your Cloud Foundry Foundations - Kurt Kellner, ECS Team    

Have you ever had to answer the question “what is happening on my foundation right now?” As a foundation operator, this is a common question. The open-source “top” plugin for the cf CLI can be a valuable tool in helping track down issues.

The “top” plugin is unlike most cf plugins which typically run using various command-line arguments, output information to the terminal and then exit. Instead, when you run “cf top” on the command-line, it will initialize a text-based interface that will allow user interaction with the screen. It works much like
the UNIX top command.

This talk will demonstrate the “top” plugin, walk through many of its features describing various use-cases where top saved valuable time in diagnosing problems. In addition to the functionality of top, a discussion of how this plugin was written and how it works under the covers.
