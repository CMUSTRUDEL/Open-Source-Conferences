	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,370
all right we'll get started here in a

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,280
minute I'm very pleased by the way to

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,110
see that the front row which is what I

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,200
always affectionately refer to as the

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,450
splash zone is well occupied because

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,060
that's usually where if you know I'm

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,400
doing a booth presentation at a trade

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,400
show yeah is that a waterproof hoodie

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,500
you know you're you're always trying to

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,510
get people to come into the to the front

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,890
row and you know you're offering like

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,480
you're not gonna have to take the test

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,480
at the end if you're in the front row

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,920
and all this like incentivizing people

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,719
but here I'm gonna have to say like

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,340
you're gonna have to just sit somewhere

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,350
outside the splash zone because the

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,420
splash zone is fully pretty well fully

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:47,850
occupied it's pleasure to say that my

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,390
name is doorman drea whit's I am on the

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,329
product marketing team at pivotal and I

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,960
also work on our customer marketing

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,960
efforts which is where we get to work on

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,670
case studies and and telling the stories

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,360
of what our customers are doing with

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,390
Cloud Foundry and so needless to say I

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,310
think that customer stories are super

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,930
important and one of the most exciting

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:19,409
parts of my job so everyone here is in

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,700
the right room as in all the other rooms

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,270
are the wrong room and this is the right

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,700
one so I'm very passionate about

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,430
customer stories and and hearing them

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,110
and learning the about what customers

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,780
are doing using the product and anger if

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,729
you will because I think that's where so

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:42,899
much knowledge actually lies and so

00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:44,850
really excited to be on the track chair

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,060
committee or whatever it was for

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,149
organizing the track for today and

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,640
tomorrow I think we have you know 13

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,560
different customer presentations over

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,780
the course of the next two days so a

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,380
tremendous amount of knowledge transfer

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,899
is gonna happen in this room it's it's

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,490
electric which don't ask me what happens

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,759
when you have that kind of electricity

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,190
in a splash zone and then you know what

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,650
happens if anyone took like physics in

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,390
high school I think you know the answer

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:19,879
that so as folks are still trickling in

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,670
I'm gonna hand it over to Savita

00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:26,060
Reina from sa P whose was another member

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,549
of the attract chair committee and she's

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:33,409
got a another couple of words to share

00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:37,159
about putting this the set of customer

00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:40,069
talks together Thank You doorman

00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:43,069
hi everyone I am Savita Rina and I am

00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,560
from sa p I work as a Senior Product

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:48,230
Marketing Manager for SP cloud platform

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,040
and I was given this amazing opportunity

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:56,090
to be a co-chair for this particular

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,930
track and to my surprise I was actually

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,420
amazed really excited to see the amazing

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,189
response we received in terms of the

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,480
number of submissions that we received

00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:11,569
for this particular use case track to my

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,579
realization as a co-chair when I was

00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:15,799
taking I just I was just telling doorman

00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:19,840
that I had taken this role that very

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:23,389
moment like you know in March and April

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,440
starting April and I was amazed at the

00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:29,120
response we got and I really felt given

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,449
that I was going to be responsible for

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,209
card foundry from a CPS perspective that

00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:37,549
cloud foundry has really arrived for

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,180
enterprises in the sense that it has

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:44,510
become a de facto platform open source

00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:48,069
platform for enterprises to build their

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,599
innovative applications so given that

00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,709
for this particular track I think like

00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,379
you know you're going to hear very

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,030
unique stories from many of the

00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:58,280
enterprises who are sharing their

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,430
presentations today you're going to hear

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,269
from JP Morgan Chase one of the oldest

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:08,299
financial services Bank about how they

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:10,459
are taking the cloud first initiative

00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:13,099
with cloud foundry you're going to hear

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:16,880
from him Anna in terms of like you know

00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:18,859
how they are making the this initiative

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,200
as part from one team and scaling it out

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,120
to the entire enterprise you're going to

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,100
hear from sa p

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,320
in terms of like you know how they have

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,449
as an enterprise software company they

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,300
have opened up their arms to the

00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:35,630
open-source community and not only are

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,750
they have they moved from being one

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,960
which they just use Cloud Foundry but

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,120
now they are actively participating in

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,270
the open-source communities and

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,729
contributing and there as well and one

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,570
thing I definitely wanted to kind of

00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:56,060
talk about was about innovation and or

00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:00,410
keynote keynote speaker yesterday from

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,500
sa p or CTO kind of alluded to this idea

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,979
about innovation not happening in

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,710
isolation and as a technologist myself

00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:12,380
as a marketer working for enterprise

00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,600
software company like sa P I believe

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,419
that it is very important for

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,940
enterprises whatever technology we are

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,789
building for enterprises it has to be

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:26,240
tied in back to their business processes

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:28,789
for enterprises really to leverage or

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,669
get the business value from whatever

00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:33,860
solutions they are building so the

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:36,139
reason I brought it up today was because

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,479
the tracks are the sessions we have

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:41,180
planned for this particular track will

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,700
allude to this idea in terms of how

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,840
these enterprises are using Cloud

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:51,860
Foundry to build innovations but at the

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,349
same time deliver those business values

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,380
back to their companies back to their

00:05:54,349 --> 00:06:00,590
customers and stakeholders given that I

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,050
won't take any more time I hope that you

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,289
will find the sessions presented during

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:10,849
this track enlightening and fulfilling

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:13,190
and and this is my hope and that it is a

00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:15,410
perfect opportunity for us all to learn

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,630
from one of the best in the industry so

00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:21,080
without any further ado let's get it

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:24,889
rolling we've got a couple more minutes

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:29,060
before the program officially begins so

00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:31,729
given the navigational challenges of the

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,460
Santa Clara Convention Center in terms

00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:38,930
of finding this room or any other room

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:41,360
or bathrooms or water fountains just

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,470
I'll just keep talking for a couple of

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,790
minutes and let people come in but I can

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,890
see a lot of people are finding their

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:52,940
way to the right room which is

00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:56,510
satisfying Kelly it's okay find a seat

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,520
you can sit next to me maybe just like a

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,220
quick poll of the room how many folks

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,670
here are using cloud foundry in their

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,500
enterprise today okay and keep your hand

00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:10,040
up if you have apps in production on

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,300
Cloud Foundry nary a hand goes down

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,390
that's wonderful

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,790
okay how many folks are looking at

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,830
evaluating Cloud Foundry today and and

00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,050
trying to learn and understand more

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:24,410
before they pull the trigger on on that

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:27,110
okay a couple folks great I think

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,810
there's going to be plenty for both of

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,750
those parties to learn in terms of how

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:35,300
to just learn from your peers also using

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,000
the platform as well as learn from those

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,360
who have already taken steps further

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,510
than you folks coming in we've got

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,940
definitely plenty of seats over here

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:49,130
splash zone is mostly occupied although

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,770
you could get extra friendly and sit

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:57,230
right next to another person I know that

00:07:51,770 --> 00:08:00,020
sometimes awkward and let's see okay

00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:03,890
three more minutes I don't want to jump

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:07,910
the gun too much but yeah I think today

00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:09,500
tomorrow you'll laugh you'll cry you'll

00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:13,490
learn and we're all gonna do it together

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,860
I hope to be in this room for as much of

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,000
the time as I possibly can I have a

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,930
couple of other obligations

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,570
unfortunately but otherwise I'm planning

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,310
to just kind of Park myself in here and

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:29,210
probably just find water in the back

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:32,000
when that's necessary so fortunately I

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:36,980
think most of our our human needs are

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:42,130
going to be provided for so anyways

00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,130
we've got a couple more minutes

00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:50,660
I would love to give an introduction of

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,330
where the restrooms are unfortunately I

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,820
don't know where they are so that was

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,610
gonna be just like a wild goose chase

00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,710
for me whenever that comes but as a

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,480
parent of small children I've trained

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,120
myself to be able to go like eight hours

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,340
without using the bathroom so hopefully

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,140
everyone else here has experience with

00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,660
that it's basically like Navy SEALs

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,660
training from what I understand I can go

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,750
without sleep I can go without water and

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,760
so this is all gonna come in handy here

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,300
today for everyone we're gonna lock the

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,450
doors

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,170
as soon as everyone's in their seat I'm

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:29,030
gonna talk in my best Valley Girl accent

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:32,750
which is another form of torture it's

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:37,220
not used in like most prisons but it's

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:38,780
an experimental thing um and from there

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,160
I think that's really gonna bring out

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:45,140
the best in everyone okay all right

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,640
so I think we're close enough it's like

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:54,080
1109 so I think we've got Bryn and

00:09:49,640 --> 00:10:00,250
Matthew from JPMorgan Chase and they're

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,250
