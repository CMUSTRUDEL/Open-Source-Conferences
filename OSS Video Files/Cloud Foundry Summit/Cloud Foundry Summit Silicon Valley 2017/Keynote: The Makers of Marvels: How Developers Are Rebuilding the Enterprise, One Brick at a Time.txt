Description: 
	Keynote: The Makers of Marvels: How Developers Are Rebuilding the Enterprise, One Brick at a Time - Abby Kearns, Executive Director, Cloud Foundry Foundation    

History teaches us that astonishing feats occur not when a singular leader envisions them, but when a mass of skilled workers collaborates to transform that vision into something material. The Pyramids of Giza, for example, were not built overnight by a Pharaoh, but constructed by tens of thousands of workers over a period of years. Today’s “pyramid” is quite a bit smaller, but a wonder of the world in its own right: The iPhone has transformed the world as we know it -- but most of its power comes from the app store, which offers thousands of apps created from the imaginations of thousands of developers. These developers are the makers of marvels in our time. They instantiate the very concept of digital transformation -- that notion of infrastructure disruption and re-assembly on the mind of every CIO. Business development is driven by software development, and software development is shaped by developers in the open source community.

In her talk, Abby Kearns empowers developers to think of themselves as the doers and makers who hold the key to unlocking digital transformation. She will cover the importance of diversity among developers for the technology industry to evolve and to reflect its user base, and will highlight the key open source concepts and technologies powering this trans-industrial transformation.

afternoon it means a lot to me welcome

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:19,320
to 2017 Cloud Foundry summit Silicon

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,789
Valley edition we are grateful that

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,560
every one of you were able to make it

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:28,380
here and for those of you tuning in via

livestream thank you I've been blessed

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,020
to be part of this community for several

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:40,550
years and each and every day you inspire

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:47,309

let me try and inspire you every one of

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:58,680
you has the potential to change our

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:59,760
industry the world and your company in

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,570
the 1800's

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,960
when rich barons had the idea of

00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:09,060
changing the face of Transportation it

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,729
wasn't them that made that happen it was

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,900
that thousands of creators the

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,670
architects the engineers that made that

00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,530
transformation that changed that and

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,170
turned the Transcontinental Railroad and

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:28,159
do a fundamental shift and what became a

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:30,570
modern marvel or in the early 1900's

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,280
when they were trying to figure out how

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,030
to connect Marin County and San

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,600
Francisco while some architects had the

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,409
idea to put in a new bridge it was the

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,270
thousands of people the creators that

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:50,640
made that a reality and turned it into

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:53,060
one of the icons of the Bay Area fast

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,829
forward a little farther into the future

00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:01,170
the smart phone how many of you here

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:04,960
have a smart phone how many of to

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:08,100
exactly today I would rather lose my

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,179
wallet than lose Mike Marco its how I

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,940
check in for my flight

00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:16,060
it's how I order groceries it's how I

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,710
get a car I pay bills I send friends

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,910
money I do everything on my phone today

00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:26,260
and is that because in 2007 Steve Jobs

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:29,650
decided to create a new phone no it was

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,350
fun but a year later when the App Store

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,360
came online and the thousands of

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,610
developers too created the thousands and

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,660
thousands of apps have made it into the

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:43,570
invaluable tool that it is today so

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,750
today I want to say that developers are

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,180
the heroes of this story each and every

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,860
one of you that are leading the change

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:56,140
in your organization we talk a lot about

00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,810
digital transformation in this community

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,870
and I know many of you are sick of the

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,940
term but it doesn't change the fact that

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:08,620
every day more and more organizations

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,510
are asking their their teens their

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,920
people to be more responsive to

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:20,140
customers innovate more and fail faster

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:23,920
a great example of that is the financial

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,870
services industry me that is the best

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,590
representation of how fast this is

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,180
changing how fast this is evolving five

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,980
years ago if you told me I would be

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,250
doing all of my banking on my mobile

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,290
phone I would have laughed but yet here

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,500
today do a hundred percent of my banking

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,830
on my phone and it's not because of the

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,380
phone no it's the application that my

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,299
bank created that runs on that phone and

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,810
that application represents more than

00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:55,540
just a small icon on my phone it

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,790
represents a new way of working for my

00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,650
bank my bank has fundamentally changed

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,930
the way they thought about technology

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,880
but more importantly how they can use

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,280
that technology

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,280
to connect with me and how I can connect

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,430
with my bank to me that's the best

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,020
representation of digital transformation

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,160
but that's also the best representation

00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,600
of why developers leading that charge

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,850
each of these organizations are

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,870
fundamentally rethinking how code is

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:27,770
written how it's deployed but also how

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,330
it's changed and iterated over time

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:34,980
they're rethinking how systems are

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:37,410
managed secured and then even scaled is

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:45,060
these applications become more powerful

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:47,010
and wider use so a goal of any platform

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,750
is to give these developers give each

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,230
and every one of you the freedom to

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,810
create the freedom to take an idea and

00:04:52,230 --> 00:05:03,600
get it into production as quickly as

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:06,300
possible that's the value of a cloud

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,550
application platform that is the value

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,770
of Cloud Foundry Cloud Foundry gives

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,650
developers the ability to take an idea

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,810
and get it into production as quickly as

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,420
possible

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,580
enabling creativity but also making it

00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,870
easier to take those ideas and get them

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,700
into the hands of users I'd like to

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:31,290
start with one of my favorite examples

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,670
Comcast last year dr. Nick made a great

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,310
joke about Comcast and I don't know that

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,320
I can top that one but I will say that

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,910
Comcast was on the stage here last year

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,420
talking about the work they were just

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:45,210
starting to do and not to steal their

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,760
thunder from their talk tomorrow but the

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,210
progress they've made is just so

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,460
significant I could not talk about it

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:56,700
since then they now have over 1500

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,010
developers working on the platform with

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,830
nearly 12,000 applications in production

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,830
and over 180 million transactions a day

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,110
crossing that platform to me that's the

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,670
power of the development but it's also

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,950
the power of how they

00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,820
can change how Comcast thinks about

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:17,580
technology to quote one of the Comcast

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,440
developers for the first time ever we

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,170
fully upgraded clappin infrastructure

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,490
with zero impact in production during

00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:29,280
business hours peak business hours so I

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,010
know each and every one of you realize

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,600
the impact that has but think about how

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:38,130
it really propagates through an

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:42,060
organization another one of my favorite

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:44,160
examples is Express Scripts one of the

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,680
largest pharmacy benefits manager in the

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,750
world

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,330
Express Scripts wanted to give their

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,310
developers that freedom they wanted to

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,550
give that self provisioning capacity to

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:59,250
their developers and by doing so they

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,790
took the legacy process that took 45

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:07,260
days to go from idea to getting

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:11,880
something into QA down to four hours 45

00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,320
days to four hours that is a monumental

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,510
shift in the way that you think about

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,680
technology and to quote Brian Gregory

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,620
boundary is our abstraction layer to

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:27,240
allow developers to focus on where they

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,860
deliver value and that's writing code at

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,840
the end of the day that's what Cloud

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,390
Foundry is here to talk about is how do

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,240
we allow each and every one of you to

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:41,580
write more code and get those ideas out

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:44,880
into production faster that's the value

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,760
of a cloud application platform that's

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,520
the value of Cloud Foundry enabling that

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:55,530
creativity and getting those eyes and

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:57,510
ideas into production faster but I'd be

00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,100
remiss a cloud foundry summit to not

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:03,950
talk about the best thing about cloud

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:06,690
foundry it's open source that's right

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,810
open source each and every one of you

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:12,020
can participate in this open source

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,140
means so many things to me but

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,850
succinctly

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:19,730
it's the opportunity to bring together

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:22,080
in diverse minds to do real innovation

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:27,270
bringing diverse people together to

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,400
solve hard problems diversity is

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:39,780
something that is immensely important to

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:41,820
me it means a lot to me it means a lot

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:45,000
to the foundation and I know it means a

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,730
lot to the community not just diversity

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,900
but inclusivity in making everyone feel

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:55,680
welcome but more than that I feel like

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,750
no company can say that they are truly

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,630
innovating yes there's diverse

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,430
participation around the table unless

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,300
there's diverse people with diverse

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,260
backgrounds from diverse organizations

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:12,630
that are sitting around the table

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:16,920
helping solve hard problems and that's

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:21,450
the value of open source open source

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:27,960
brings together diverse minds to solve

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:32,280
hard problems it's as light as has to be

00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:34,320
a great example of that though is a

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,880
project many of you here participated in

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,240
and is something that meant a lot to me

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:42,290
last year the open service broker API

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,850
project that's right

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,650
you should be excited this to me

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:51,030
represented all that is amazing about

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:54,300
open source together with Google and IBM

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,980
and pivotal and STP in Fujitsu and Red

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,410
Hat

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,810
we took the cloud foundry service broker

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,250
API which you know I might be biased but

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,860
is one of the coolest things about cloud

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,210
foundry and allowed other platforms to

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,550
take advantage of that amazing

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:11,010
technology but more than that allowed

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:14,550
them to participate to continue to drive

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,650
innovation on that technology making it

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:21,900
the best possible way to connect

00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:24,120
services to a platform any platform and

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:28,530
that to me really represents how

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,150
powerful open source can be and while

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,740
I'm up on stage talking about open

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,190
source and collaboration

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:38,760
I get to announce another collaborative

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,670
project Kubo many of you are probably

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,160
already familiar with it but it's

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,850
allowing Bosch the package up and manage

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,260
kubernetes alongside Cloud Foundry

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,570
extending that day to capability that

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,040
Bosch brings to the table across

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,670
kubernetes and cloud foundry

00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,090
environments this project started by

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,920
Google and pivotal as as of this morning

00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,440
been officially donated to the Cloud

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:13,800
Foundry foundation so that we can

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:15,510
continue or yes allowing us to continue

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,060
work on what I think is going to be an

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:23,220
amazing project within the broader

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:25,680
open-source community so as I think

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,500
about those two projects and the many

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,700
more that are under dr. max's purview in

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,410
the extensions project group that to me

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,200
really represents the value of open

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,660
source but also the value of all of you

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:45,300
participating in that and being part of

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:47,630
that so today I want to marry these two

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,120
concepts cloud application platform

00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:53,160
which drives creativity it makes it

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,130
easier for developers to get ideas to

00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:03,390
market faster with open source diversity

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:08,640
driving innovation and we get Cloud

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:11,100
Foundry so I want to talk a little bit

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,790
about community velocity since we're all

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,520
here at Summit we have some exciting

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:23,340
numbers to share we recently crossed

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:25,140
with 2400 person contributor mark but

00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:30,330
better than that the last 12 months

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:33,000
we've passed 51,000 commits that isn't

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:36,450
impressive in a year that's impressive

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,470
for an open source project any open

00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,670
source project we've surpassed 70,000

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,610
people

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,740
in our user organizations around the

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,470
world

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,540
the self-organized meetups over 70,000

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:58,260
people participate in those every single

00:12:51,540 --> 00:13:01,440
day we're up to 64 members 64 amazing

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,870
companies participate in Cloud Foundry

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,750
every single day giving up your time

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,440
your energy to be part of this community

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:13,350
and that means a lot to us

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,180
in fact it means so much I'm excited to

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,270
announce the newest member of Cloud

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:21,120
Foundry foundation the small little

00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:33,240
startup out of Redmond has decided to

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:35,460
join and become a gold member so tuck to

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,500
talk about Microsoft I want to bring up

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,030
Corrie Sanders from the Microsoft Azure

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,340
compute team to tell us a little bit

00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,620
more about what Cloud Foundry means to

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,540
Microsoft yeah thanks Abby we're

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,590
supposed to shake it we got I think

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,620
stuff no selfie

00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:52,470
this is did anyone get a picture okay

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,730
sorry just got awkward anyway thank you

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,020
so much right now we walk really far

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,910
away from each other thank you so much

00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,100
for having me on stage it's really

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,780
exciting I think if you look at sort of

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,940
the timeline of our involvement with

00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,040
Cloud Foundry it's this is not the first

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,450
step for us we've actually been involved

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,120
in working with Todd Kranti for quite

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,250
some time actually all the way back 2015

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,650
and joining the foundation is kind of a

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:17,160
natural progression for us it's a

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:19,530
natural step forward for us you know and

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,840
as part of offering the solution and as

00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:24,090
part of working we see so many customers

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,240
excited about deploying Cloud Foundry on

00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:28,290
Azure and its really fantastic and one

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,460
of the biggest things that we hear from

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,110
these customers are looking for an

00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,810
enterprise platform that can run on

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:36,090
enterprise cloud but really the key

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,950
point is portability right and Abbie

00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:40,230
talks a lot about the open source focus

00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,320
the ability to take this path and deploy

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,150
across multiple clouds deploy on Prem in

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,520
a hybrid way all this is really

00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,960
fantastic it's a beautiful thing and so

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,120
to enable that we've continued to do a

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,490
lot of work in Azure to

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,650
make cloud money were great we recently

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,480
announced bicycle and Postgres managed

00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,420
services those are now supported in our

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,820
service brokers we've also recently

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,140
announced a new cloud shell the Azure

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,510
cloud shell if you haven't played with

00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,660
this you should it's basically a bash

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,550
shell no matter where you go build right

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,339
into the azure portal we've now added

00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,600
the cloud foundry CLI right into that so

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:16,730
you don't have to do any app get you

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,430
just launch it and go it's just really

00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,020
really fantastic yeah that is so

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:25,000
exciting in fact I think you've got

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,240
quote one of our favorite shared users

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,720
yes

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,770
so Merrill is and actually I will read

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,660
this quote and then I'll talk a little

00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,960
bit more so Merrill's quote here from

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,000
Thomas Vidal is we need to iterate our

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,220
way to gridded products to get solutions

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,320
into customers hands quickly see what

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,510
they like make changes and keep

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,970
improving the fail-fast concept with

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,250
Azure and cloud foundry we can do that

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,500
and what we've seen from Merrill is it's

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,120
an old company 50 years old they've got

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,770
a lot of legacy applications and

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,779
infrastructure to deal with they're

00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,600
really a great cloud transformation

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,760
story they've taken their solution and

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,760
they're moving to a much more agile

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,830
micro service based solution with cloud

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,089
foundry and spring and they wanted them

00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,459
to play this on a trusted in global

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:13,010
cloud and actually the they're one of

00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:15,410
our largest users on our German region

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,060
which is uniquely supporting a lot of

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,250
the trust requirements of the German

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,380
government so it's been fantastic to see

00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,029
that that support through customers but

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,410
you know one important point to call out

00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:26,690
where would we be without our partners

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,830
and so one a couple partners who are at

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,910
sort of mentioning obviously we've

00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,830
worked with pivotal from the very

00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,000
beginning they've been fantastic but a

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,190
couple of new partners that we're

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,320
working with sa P cloud application

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,140
platform we recently announced plans to

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,730
support that on Azure and GE predicts we

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,959
work with pretty closely to so a lot of

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,400
folks in the community we've been

00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,170
engaging with and of course the

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,990
foundation as well so now it comes

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,000
closer exactly coming back so thank you

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,400
so much for having thank you so much for

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,080
