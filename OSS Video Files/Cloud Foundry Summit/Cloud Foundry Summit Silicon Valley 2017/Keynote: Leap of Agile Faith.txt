Thank You Kim good morning love the

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:14,400
energy up here alright so my name is

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,460
mojo and Lefevre and as Kim said I'm the

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,369
CIO of Liberty Mutual's global specialty

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,010
unit when I'm gonna spend the next 15 to

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,939
20 minutes talking about is really the

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,560
story of how Liberty Mutual a

00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:32,250
hundred-year-old insurance company is

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,000
jumping into the cloud leveraging cloud

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,590
foundry and agile methodologies to truly

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,100
transform the way that we deliver

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:45,059
software and technology to our end users

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,260
both our customers and our employees but

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,079
I want to start with just telling you a

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,059
little bit about my background so I left

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,460
my hometown and home country of Iran

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,230
right after high school to come to the

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,079
u.s. to study computer science at

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,300
Georgia Tech while at Tech I actually

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,370
worked as a developer at Georgia Tech

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,220
Research Institute I need programming

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,070
for unmanned missiles and pattern

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,689
recognition for tanks in the military

00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,000
from there after school I actually

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,670
joined as a developer at BellSouth I

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,790
really loved programming but it was

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,009
fascinated by the impact that it had on

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:23,310
technology and on the business and so I

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,070
went back to school did my MBA then

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,750
joined Bain as a strategy consultant but

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,600
then with all that was happening with

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,090
the Internet in the 2000s I decided to

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,799
go back to the world of technology

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,290
joined a start-up called Ihram and then

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,950
from there went on to some larger

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,840
organizations eventually in 2010 joining

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,220
Liberty Mutual as the CIO of the

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,740
commercial business and then four years

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,009
ago took over a cio for our global

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,430
specialty business Liberty Mutual is a

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,560
large globally diversified property and

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,290
casualty insurance company were a

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,729
fortune seventy-three company and we

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:05,579
have 37 plus billion in revenues every

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:09,599
year we spend over a billion and a half

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:12,330
dollars on technology building solutions

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,100
both again for internal use and external

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,350
use

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,080
just think about that number and we've

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,820
been around for over a hundred years so

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,770
as you can imagine the way that we've

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,880
usually developed our solutions is

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:27,170
spending months gathering requirements

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,690
many times not necessarily directly

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,660
talking to the end users but having lots

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,000
of bas and analysts and project managers

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,280
in between and then the development

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,220
teams would go off and sometimes spend a

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,510
year or even more developing a solution

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,400
and then bringing it back so you can

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,370
imagine that by the time the end users

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,920
saw the solution it was usually not what

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,620
they expected most of the time it would

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,110
have taken longer was more expensive and

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,240
didn't really do but they thought they

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,490
were getting and so we of course

00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,890
realized that this has to change

00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,170
and I'd say this change is probably even

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:06,140
more critical right now in a world where

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,780
our consumers and our employees are the

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:13,570
same consumers of companies like Amazon

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:16,610
Netflix Airbnb and others and so really

00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:19,970
we have competition coming at us from

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,820
every site and the pace of change that's

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,770
happening in the world around us is

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,200
accelerating I take Marc Andreessen

00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,060
probably put it best when he said

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,890
software is eating the world and that's

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,320
absolutely true in the world of

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,360
insurance as well whether it's companies

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,750
like Metro Mile that do pay per mile

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,570
insurance or illuminate that does

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,950
insurance for renters and homeowners

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,720
where they've taken out all of the red

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,950
tape and paperwork that's involved in

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,530
buying insurance and you can actually

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:51,800
buy insurance on your phone with just a

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:55,580
few clicks and swipes we know that we to

00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:59,090
have to become a software company that

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:02,930
sells insurance so with such a large

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:06,050
transformation ahead of us we went ahead

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,930
and put some very aggressive objectives

00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:12,350
for ourselves knowing that going to the

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:15,170
cloud having an automated pipeline that

00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,549
enables us to release code much faster

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,820
and much more frequently than we do

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:21,049
today

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,030
and having the right makeup for our IT

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:25,580
organization were really critical to

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,570
this transformation and I can tell you

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,370
that these are

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,460
very very aggressive goals for us

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:34,940
because today we probably only have 5 to

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,890
10% max of our workload in the cloud we

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:41,960
definitely don't release code on a daily

00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:45,470
basis and probably at most 50% of our IT

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,240
staff actually write code the others are

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,610
doing documentation requirements

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,340
gathering project management and a lot

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,790
of operational roles especially as it

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,560
relates to infrastructure we also know

00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,360
that this transformation isn't really

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,670
something that the IT organization can

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,880
do on its own and that business buy-in

00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:07,550
and involvement from all of the company

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,750
and the entire business is absolutely

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,690
critical to the transformation we've

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,790
also recognized that we absolutely need

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,950
partnership from some key partners and

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,580
on the slide you see just a couple of

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:26,240
those with Cloud Foundry and pivot holes

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:30,650
pivotal lab arm and Amazon Web Services

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,810
just being some of those so what I want

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,150
to share with you is how in my business

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,150
unit at global specialty we're actually

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,390
making our transformation real by

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,830
putting some of these methodologies

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,770
frameworks and technologies into

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:49,250
practice recognizing that it's really

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,900
only by doing by experimenting perhaps

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,380
sometimes failing a little bit but

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,990
picking back up learning from it and

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,210
really leveraging all of these new

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,210
methodologies and technologies that we

00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,920
can work towards the objectives the very

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,380
aggressive objectives that we have set

00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,970
and so one of the things that I told my

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,950
team a couple of years ago and together

00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,480
we came to the conclusion was that with

00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,000
every opportunity that would come our

00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,490
way we would build it on the cloud

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,530
unless we proved that for some reason we

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:22,670
couldn't do that and we have yet to

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:24,950
encounter such an instance and so and

00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,990
the opportunity came our way last year

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,480
in August of 2016

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,610
where our Australian business was

00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,920
looking to enter the accident and health

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:37,880
insurance market which is a quarter

00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,860
billion market they wanted to be able to

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,310
do that within six months because really

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,870
the Ring

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,540
you'll season was gonna start in March

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,070
of 2017 so they came to us and they said

00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,810
we want to get into this opportunity

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,310
because it's really one of the first

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,590
times in a few years that we have an

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,690
opportunity for growth but all of the

00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,040
competition and the pricing pressures

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,290
that have been out there they hadn't

00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,540
been able to grow and so this was very

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,370
important to them

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,320
so what they wanted the technology team

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,230
to do was to build an end-to-end

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,170
underwriting portal for the brokers so

00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:12,530
that they could go live by March of 2017

00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,150
and so that meant we only had six months

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,470
to really to do everything understand

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,130
exactly what it was that they were

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:21,080
looking for and build it for them and so

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,870
we started to evaluate our options we

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,240
had three we went out and looked at the

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,860
vendor solutions that were available

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,750
very quickly learned that the brokers

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,310
actually pretty much hated what was out

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,740
there but they were using it because

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,960
that's all the other companies were

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,910
offering them plus it would have taken

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,690
definitely more than six months and

00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,010
several million to put that in place

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,170
using the word that chip said he hated

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,270
legacy platforms but we said let's look

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,640
at what we already had and what would it

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,010
take to invest and bring that up to what

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,710
it needed to be but we realized that

00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,660
investing hundreds of thousands in older

00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,760
technology would really not get us there

00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,130
especially that's all of those solutions

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,100
were hosted in our data centers in the

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:06,290
US and so we recognized very quickly

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,830
that really the best choice that we had

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,930
was to build the solution to be exactly

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,570
what they needed but to build it on new

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:17,750
technology and to build it with an agile

00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,850
mindset so that would be laser focus on

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,370
delivering a Minimum Viable Product that

00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:26,240
could be ready in a matter of months and

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:29,180
to build it with cloud foundry and to

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,160
leverage pivotal labs to really teach

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,840
our teams how to do this with

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,390
test-driven development and parrot

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:40,970
programming and truly a true agile model

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,560
so what we did was in September of 2016

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,810
we actually sent a couple of our

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,910
developers to Sydney where our chief

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,860
underwriter was and worked with pivotal

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,360
labs in Sydney to do the framing and

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,270
they also went out and started

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,120
interviewing the brokers believe it or

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,529
not this was the

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,690
first time that our developers were

00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,550
actually directly talking to the end

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,460
customer I can tell you the energy they

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:05,010
got from that was phenomenal

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,370
then they went back to Dublin where our

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,200
agile team was based and at pivotal labs

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,630
in Dublin they started building and

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,050
within only four weeks they actually had

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,370
a workable MBP not something that could

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,500
be put in front of the brokers

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,330
necessarily but something that we could

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,520
start having the internal underwriters

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,140
start giving feedback on and the product

00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,210
owner of course was quite engaged as

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,100
well working with us on a daily basis

00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,960
and so they continued to iterate and

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,830
build integrated with the back-end

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,660
systems of claims on finance making sure

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,370
that underwriting capabilities coding

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,950
and rating capabilities were also

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,690
available and then they put a second

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,430
product on so first they started with

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,020
corporate travel and then a second

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,140
insurance product was on and then within

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,060
six months the portal was ready and in a

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,400
state that it could actually be given to

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,520
our brokers first throughout the process

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,720
we had a few of the friendly brokers

00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,070
also involved making sure that we were

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,050
getting feedback from them and

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,890
incorporating that into the build of the

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,450
solution so he was I want to just

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,900
introduce you to three of the folks that

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:12,270
were very critical to the success with

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,150
our chief underwriter the product owner

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,709
and a couple of the technical guys who

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,029
were involved in this and so I'm going

00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:20,029
to pass the mic on to them

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:59,610
[Music]

00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:02,730
so really the team learning experience

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,040
was fantastic they hit all the deadlines

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,130
and delivered a product that was getting

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,840
rave reviews from the brokers but I want

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,090
to share a little bit more about the

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,710
experience and really how were measuring

00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,650
the success and some of the drivers of

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:19,500
that success in talking to the team one

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,690
of the main things that they tell us is

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,910
that it was really the culture that they

00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,070
established within the team that was

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,990
critical to their success the fact that

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,570
they were laser focused on delivering

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,040
value measuring it by the user stories

00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,780
that were directly defined by the

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,400
product owner and the number of user

00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,620
stories that they could actually put

00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,870
into production at the speed that they

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,510
were doing it they were also very

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,830
autonomous so every single person who

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,140
needed to be part of the decision-making

00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,300
process and approvals was actually part

00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,430
of the project team so this was an

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,160
autonomous agile team that didn't need

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,960
to wait for others for approvals that

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,480
could sometimes take days or weeks in

00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,250
the world that we work in and then

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,350
finally it was really the technical

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,930
excellence of the tools and everything

00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,120
that they had in their hands and the

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,100
ability to really do the test-driven

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,080
development and parrot programming that

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,800
helped them become better and better

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:16,680
even throughout the project and then

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,300
additionally the speak to market that

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,220
was delivered in this case was very

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,870
different from what we could have done

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,730
in the past where it would have taken at

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,880
least a year for us to put the first

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:32,370
release in the hands of the users and

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,290
also the release cycle time was

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,750
extremely different what with what we

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,680
were used to so again in the past if it

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,910
would have taken a year

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,370
to put something in the hands of the

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:44,040
users in this case in a matter of weeks

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,080
first MVP was developed and then it

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,730
continued to get better and better and

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,240
have more capabilities and

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:53,370
functionalities so in five months we had

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,649
16 releases that were put in the hands

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,730
of our users and so that was very

00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:01,950
different from what they were used to

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:05,520
all of this really resulting in a

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:08,610
superior product so the strike rate

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,540
which is the number of quotes becoming

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:15,959
policies in this instance was 40%

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:18,029
compared to 20% for the industry while

00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,399
on other competitors systems it took ten

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:22,290
minutes to do referrals with our system

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,940
it took only three minutes now it's not

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,310
because it was magic it was because in

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,290
the interviews it had been made very

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,760
obvious that referral time was one of

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,399
the biggest pain points with some of the

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,170
other systems so the team made sure that

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,600
they focused on that and that they

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,760
delivered what the brokers were looking

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,900
for and so within the first month of

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:48,150
operation we had almost 200 coats and 60

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:50,700
policies bound in the system and so now

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:53,640
I just want to leave you with some of

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:57,330
what testimonials our developers have

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,130
told us they talked about how with the

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:03,630
framework their work was able to be

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:06,450
really accelerated the fact that because

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,610
they could focus on actually coding they

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,830
were able to improve their technical

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,570
capabilities over the six months that

00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,490
they were on this project and they're

00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,140
continuing to do that and the fact that

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,020
they were doing this in parrot

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,800
programming also contributed a lot to

00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,910
them learning every day

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,860
with all of the tools and frameworks

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,079
that they had at their hands their

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,150
productivity was much higher than they

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,490
were used to and the fact that every

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,380
developer got to work on every tier of

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,550
the application was very important to

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,709
them it just made it much more

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:41,010
interesting and their learning was much

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:44,339
larger and of course all of it resulting

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,930
in a much higher quality product than

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,170
many of the other software solutions

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,640
that would take much longer to develop

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,980
they were working in a technology stack

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,740
that

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,540
actually wanted to be working in and I

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,329
say finally the fact that they were

00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:02,339
spending most of their time doing what

00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:05,610
they loved was very important to them so

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:08,170
really by taking a little bit of risk

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,480
deciding to jump into the cloud and

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,630
leverage cloud foundry and other

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,269
frameworks we were able to deliver a

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:19,290
speech to market building the right

00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:22,029
product and building it the right way

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,709
but I'd say more importantly or most

00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:28,120
importantly we had a very engaged

00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:30,699
environment and our talent was very

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,079
engaged and they felt great because they

00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:37,150
felt like they were developing and

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:41,730
learning every day thank you

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,730
