There are many pieces that must fall into place for an enterprise transformation to succeed: a strong vision, support from a leadership coalition, leveraging new technology and business models and most of all the engagement and drive of the individuals who power the corporation.

take just a moment and remember your

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:10,759
first job in software what was it like

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,679
and who were the people you worked with

00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,940
and would you say that the successes you

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:21,660
achieved or because of or in spite of

00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,890
the environment you work done I have to

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,869
admit as I look back on my own

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,000
experience I was really lucky to work

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,970
with some great people but the rest is a

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,149
bit of a mixed bag I came out of

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,880
training and some great lab experience

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,610
having learned a bunch of languages and

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,200
written operating systems and done some

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,690
interesting things with natural language

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,360
processing and so I was so excited to

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,230
get a position working on a defense

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,270
project inside a big enterprise and

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,520
inside a big government contractor

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,350
enterprise on satellite and missile

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,420
systems and I was ready to put all this

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,329
knowledge and to solve big chewy

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,010
problems and I didn't know that right

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,489
away I'd run smack into the wall the

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,890
cubicle farm right I had so much more to

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,890
learn but all that technical education

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,500
and experience didn't prepare me for I

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,119
spent months in that cube reading

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,830
through big stacks of standard operating

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,939
procedures technical specifications

00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,479
learning about super specialization

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,920
within this type of software development

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:27,750
like I said there was a great team so

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,850
the people were wonderful but boy did I

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,070
find myself spending a lot of time that

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,710
I wasn't in my cube in dark conference

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,350
rooms with them at the dreaded change

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,540
advisory board learning how he had to

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,790
carefully review every single proposal

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,100
for a change because of all the risk it

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,500
might bring now don't get me wrong I

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,930
appreciate that that system came up for

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,030
very good reason over a number of years

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,140
by very well many well-intentioned

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,060
people and since then during that and

00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,310
since I've made it really part of my

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,880
mission in life to think how can we

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,340
improve things I am always in awe and so

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,429
respectful of how amazing teams of

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,250
people accomplish unbelievable

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,500
achievement despite the barriers put in

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,690
their way but at the same time

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,030
I'm always very mindful that if we

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,820
create an environment that's effective

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,620
easy and really most of all fun to work

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,410
in that's when the real greatness

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,040
happens right let's make it easy says a

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,260
leader in a CIO that's a huge part of my

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,000
job and I'm really excited to be able to

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,520
be here today and talk to you a little

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,410
bit about the work we've done over the

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,020
last few years to really create that

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,330
environment and ecosystem for not only

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,660
our developers but for the whole product

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,550
team to achieve and succeed and really

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,150
give the best for our customers and our

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:54,440
business units here's a photo of one of

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,630
our great product teams in our labs I

00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,600
think Abby's theme yesterday was spot-on

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,489
the developer is a hero and I kind of

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,860
think of the whole product team like the

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:07,020
Justice League right each product teams

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,060
like their own Justice League of heroes

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,040
of different roles really out there

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,640
getting the right thing done for our

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,489
business and for the customer we went we

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,980
went in really big on change starting in

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,540
early 2015

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,600
really systemic change that I want to

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,880
talk to you about change again that is

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,910
designed at unleashing the power of

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,950
these heroes to really perform for all

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,170
today so I'm going to tell you a little

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,810
bit more about Allstate and the great

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,610
opportunity we've got at hand but really

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,500
spent some time talking about this

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,049
ecosystem that we fostered that we

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,660
continue to foster as we scale and

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,400
perform and I'm really excited to be

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,049
able to share with you direct from the

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,549
voice of some of our customers who've

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,650
been delighted by the changes we're

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,769
making and the impact it has on their

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,570
experienced in life so if you've been

00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,530
here the past few years you might have

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,160
already heard a little bit about

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,380
Allstate two years ago our then CTO and

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,570
ease it knee talked about how we were

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,120
creating the freedom to disrupt he

00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,390
really gave us no excuse to say no to

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,820
making big bold change and last year my

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,310
colleague Doug Stafford came back and he

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,690
talked about no reason to slow down how

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,940
to blow through the walls and keep

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,400
accelerating change and scale of this

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,250
transformation putting the power in the

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,080
hands of all of our product teams

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,580
so I'm really excited to be able to give

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,680
you this update if you don't know about

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,290
Allstate I'll just give you the quick

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,540
rundown so we were born in 1931 we're

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,940
just an 86 year old company not quite

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,370
the century you were hearing about in

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,860
the last talk but we were born in a

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,870
period when the use of the automobile

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,060
was really scaling so think about that

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,520
what a past period of huge societal

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,930
disruption and then think now what we're

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,540
living through the wave of digital

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,120
disruption and the continuing change in

00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,520
automotive and transport and what that

00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,870
brings to our society but particularly

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,040
to our industry and property and

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,920
casualty insurance

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,560
we're the largest publicly held property

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,600
and casualty insurer in the US and we

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,750
have this tremendous responsibility of

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,930
taking care of over 16 million customer

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,850
households that's a tremendous thing

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,830
that we hold in high regard our purpose

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,840
as a company is to protect those

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,790
customers from life's uncertainties and

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,010
to restore them when something bad

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,110
happens and for me as chief information

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,450
officer of the claims division that

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,820
restoration aspect is really close to

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,160
the heartbeat of what my team and I do

00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,410
every day but we work together it's an

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,150
enterprise we're also very committed to

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,060
giving back in all the communities that

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,790
we're in and across many many different

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,560
dimensions for the last several years

00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,460
we've really been thinking and dreaming

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,050
together as a whole company about

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,750
creating what we call the 22nd century

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,780
corporation when we think about all the

00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,270
dynamics changing in society and many of

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,040
those that are so digitally enabled we

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,140
really think that the companies that

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,350
continue to thrive in the future will do

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,870
this by building strategic platforms

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:11,120
those platforms to allow our customers

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,300
to interact other stakeholders and with

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,380
us in more and more meaningful ways

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,260
transcending from just a product by

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:21,380
product basis to a way to really fulfill

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,090
our purpose for for our customers and

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,220
their families throughout the different

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,729
stages of their life and we'll do that

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:31,010
again by strengthening our relationships

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:32,690
how do we show that commitment in many

00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,910
different arms there's so much that we

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,400
can do to really connect all of the

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,840
great assets we have all the power that

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,880
our customers have

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,980
and bring it to the fore and we believe

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,100
in doing that as a company well we also

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,389
create positive societal change I love

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,400
that aspect it was a huge thing that

00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,780
attracted me to the company and it's

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,000
also something that you'll hear we've

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,560
really worked to live into as we want to

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,810
improve the lives for every employee

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,150
every developer every product manager

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,370
every designer every one that interacts

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,020
in our ecosystem positive change

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,900
together we're all shaping the future

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,780
and it's really exciting and I do think

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,850
it's a huge exciting time sometimes we

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,160
can kind of dwell on the dark clouds of

00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,020
the threat of industry disruption you

00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,870
heard about it a little bit already this

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,150
morning it's amazing to watch and see

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,919
what competitors are doing what's some

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,680
of the new upstarts as digital breaks

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,970
down the barriers to entry perhaps using

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,460
some of the same technology we're

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,510
talking about today right one one

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,880
company has gotten a lot of attention

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:34,460
recently is lemonade offering insurance

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,010
wholly digitally and in some cases

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,750
resolving claims in three minutes it's

00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,430
an interesting case to look at it's too

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,500
early to know how that particular

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,930
business model will play out but

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,180
directionally no doubt right there is

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,479
huge change in the industry there's

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,760
changed from competitors and new

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,580
entrants into the market there's changes

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,289
from coming from autonomous driving from

00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,750
the sharing economy from all different

00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:02,570
aspects we're intent on embracing this

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,360
opportunity and like I said that's why

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:08,570
we really went in big starting in 2015

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,610
to change the way we do development if

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,320
you stop by our booth when you get a

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,539
chance and you're out in the foundry

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,280
you'll kind of see our tagline about

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:19,280
we're really changing everything it's

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,620
how we do we think we act from the start

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,539
to the end changing what we do so let me

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,090
break it down for a little bit and tell

00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:28,639
you about that ecosystem and I'm going

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,650
to use a metaphor today of this tree

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,380
growing out right in the open air

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,680
because I think it's really apt to talk

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,719
about you can think about developers the

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,669
tree or a product team as the tree but

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,190
it's all about how to a healthy growth

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,800
as an individual and what we give there

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,050
but it's also about all the surrounding

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,570
bits it takes in the environment to make

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,010
that really flourish I like using the

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,710
tree for a couple reasons again I think

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,170
it's an app to

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,950
for it also reminds me it's the exact

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,050
opposite

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,060
back when I had that first job and I was

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,570
sitting in my dank little cubicle farm I

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,160
can remember some of my more I'll say

00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,830
seasoned colleagues used to walk by

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,080
sometimes and they say like yep

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,060
we're just mushrooms they keep us in the

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,760
dark and feed us full of crap

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,430
so not growing mushrooms here we're

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,860
going some trees or you know other great

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,930
produce on our farm but again it's

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,510
really important because it's at the

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,310
core of recognizing our company has

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,110
always been one that valued every

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,750
individual and what we have to give but

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,090
that can get lost in this super super

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,070
system of enterprise level risk and

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,200
control and how we really put the team's

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,560
back at the forefront of what we're

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,380
doing it starts with being customer

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,540
centric customer and user driven

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:49,230
development and that sounds pretty

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,940
obvious but some of you may know it's a

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,010
bit more of a change than it seems on

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,260
the surface level if you've been layered

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,750
into a traditional IT organization that

00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,690
maybe had a lot of intermediaries in the

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,490
past era it was it was pretty credible

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,990
to say that someone that had been in the

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,940
business for thirty years had enough

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,040
expertise that they could prescribe and

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,290
specify what we were to build and if we

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,030
built it it would be successful that's

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,680
no longer the case right with changing

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,080
consumer preferences with changing

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,330
competition we need to get direct to the

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,770
heart of the customer and direct to the

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,650
heart of our fellow employees that serve

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,690
the customer in so many ways that's

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:28,020
really the central that focal point for

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:31,260
us how do we focus on that and then it

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,060
came down to creating the environment we

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,760
started with some very bold physical

00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,060
moves in our lab space creating pairing

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,220
stations making screens very visible to

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,650
be able to track the pipeline giving

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,810
lots of collaborative area moving people

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,450
from separate functional teams into

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,430
cross-functional co-located lab settings

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,250
and giving them plenty of space to work

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,500
things out partnering to do design

00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,140
thinking sessions moving through to

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,870
learning a Lean Startup approach getting

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,610
into experimentation of course our

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,250
decision to adopt Cloud Foundry it was

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,690
huge we worked with pivotal very closely

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,310
in the early stages

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,990
and we're very excited since we joined

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,990
the foundation to benefit from whole

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,850
community all of these pieces are very

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,269
necessary but they're not sufficient

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:20,100
right they all have to work in tandem we

00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:22,500
hired an awesome platform leader and

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,199
Matt curry who came in and he's led his

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,790
team and they have tremendous empathy so

00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:29,459
they were a key part of not just getting

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,230
the platform up and able to run but in

00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,930
helping teach everybody else within the

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,930
system what we need to learn and that's

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,550
been fantastic developer leaders like

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,500
myself started realizing wow we really

00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:43,050
need to get the devs up tempo and on

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,029
scale we've hired great engineers for

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,730
years but they performed exactly in this

00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:49,410
system as we prescribed it right how do

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,660
we make sure people come current with

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,240
cloud native how do you do that with a

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,069
large incumbent developer workforce and

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,350
most of all how do you do that without

00:11:56,069 --> 00:12:00,569
slowing down this tremendous engine of

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,850
business change that you're only seeking

00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:04,079
to accelerate at the end of the day so

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,110
we developed a partnership with

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,899
galvanize and brought a 12-week bespoke

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,630
bootcamp type of approach in-house where

00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,509
we train developers we train them on XP

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,550
methods on new tools on cloud foundry on

00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:18,870
other technologies we've adapted the

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,670
curricula as we went forward

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,230
we've put hundreds of people globally

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,870
now at different sites through this

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,329
training we just graduated a class in

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,220
Charlotte North Carolina this week and

00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,439
we'll be starting a class in Dallas in

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,899
just a few weeks from now so that's been

00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:36,149
very effective because what we didn't do

00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,860
take people out of work and put them

00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:39,959
into training and then drop them back

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,660
into work we brought real product

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:45,089
backlog small to medium sized candidate

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,370
products we trained product managers

00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,439
parallel to the developer program and

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,930
starting in week five of a 12-week

00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:53,880
program they start co-developing so at

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,809
the end of 12 weeks we finish a Dornier

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,850
MVP answering some hypotheses validating

00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:02,399
or honestly sometimes invalidating and

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,350
shutting down threads of inquiry it's

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,730
tremendous in the time that we used to

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,009
spend just discussing and debating

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,600
whether we could write a check to have

00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:11,129
some people spend a few hours in a

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,199
conference room to get together and

00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:14,790
maybe outline an estimate of what it

00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,709
would take over the next nine months to

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,899
conceivably get things done if we didn't

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:20,610
hit big road roadblocks and if the

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,379
infrastructure got provision

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,600
we've got people spinning up and working

00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,129
from there we've only like lift the

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,429
switch to just fire it up even more

00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:32,160
again the platform enables it the

00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:34,860
training enables it there are many other

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,569
aspects other tools we brought in DevOps

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,299
different approaches it all comes

00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:41,519
together it's a holistic environment of

00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:43,470
really creating this a big part of it to

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,069
you has been the role changes it's

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,779
shifting people from the traditional way

00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:51,689
of development again very segmented

00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,749
Waterfall practice to more dynamic

00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:58,259
everyone exercising critical thinking

00:13:53,749 --> 00:14:00,029
product managers designers engineers all

00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:01,980
working together a lot less

00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:03,899
specialization moving closer to a

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,339
full-stack approach we still have

00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,350
specialists that are that are near to

00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,209
help the teams but it's amazing right I

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,160
think many of you have seen this what we

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:13,319
can accomplish with a few talented pairs

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,540
and the right product management and

00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,970
design team to prove things out for the

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,499
enterprise in a short period of time so

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,389
that to me is like the soil right

00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:23,459
everyone needs to take root that's the

00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:25,889
the real core of what's feeding you as

00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,949
an individual and enterprise to be able

00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:30,540
to exercise your expertise and do that

00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:33,749
in benefit of the business and the

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,360
customer and of course all that is to

00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:38,279
apply our best talents to these business

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,709
opportunities the winds of change are

00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,329
blowing through they're accelerating all

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,269
the time that's like the air that we're

00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:47,220
breathing off of I love the business

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,470
leaders we're working with who are

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,139
coming with excited ideas and

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,269
challenging us and also understanding as

00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:57,029
they themselves learn more about lean

00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:58,290
and agile thinking the concept of MVP

00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,910
they don't need to ask for it all

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,069
upfront anymore but if we can agree

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:05,369
what's really useful to prove a

00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:07,410
hypothesis we can move out together so

00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:09,899
it is a cross-functional effort it does

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,119
cross the bounds of Technology but it's

00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,189
been very exciting to see where with the

00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:17,939
technology we can able exploring these

00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:19,199
business opportunities at speed and then

00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:21,860
I want to take a few minutes to talk

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,119
about the support that has to happen

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,699
because I think that's easy to gloss

00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:28,259
over sometimes people understand it

00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:31,889
takes an enormity of investment and

00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:33,629
support but also I hear people sometimes

00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,259
jump right to the fact well if you do

00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:37,199
that if you did

00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,970
all that right if you invest it in the

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,649
labs and you changed all of your real

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,589
estate if you invested in the

00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:45,359
partnerships and the training and Cloud

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,369
Foundry and you brought all this in you

00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:50,519
obviously have top-down support and you

00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:53,089
are just there and going and it is true

00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,100
it takes that support but once again

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,649
necessary not sufficient it's not a

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,139
one-time willing to write a check from

00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:03,449
those of us of the most senior levels on

00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,220
down through it really takes continuing

00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:08,309
support and from the technology

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,279
leadership across to the business just

00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:13,379
spent a lot a lot of time all of us on

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,470
the ground exploring our own behaviors

00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:18,509
our own rules how do we act how do we

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,309
show up how do we really support and

00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:22,079
enable the team those are some great

00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:24,239
themes I think in in leadership in

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,799
general one book that I read over the

00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:28,019
past years I got a lot of meaning out of

00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,239
was team of teams by retired Army

00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,369
General Stan McChrystal and he talks

00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:35,339
about this thing right we need the teams

00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:36,959
to me are the various product teams but

00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,879
getting them to work together and that

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,179
in the past a command-and-control

00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,069
mindset we thought we could just say use

00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:45,600
cloud foundry pair together

00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,669
why aren't you building great software

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,279
and instead there are all the things

00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:51,779
day-to-day that can creep in it's

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,329
ongoing funding it's makes making sure

00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:56,489
there aren't contradictory messages it's

00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:58,049
really walking the talk I've realized

00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:00,359
more and more consciously in the last

00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:01,980
six months with my teams as I sat down

00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:02,970
at the end of last year and I reflect

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,799
and I thought we've made so much

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:08,129
tremendous progress and people have

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,199
really bent into that and I've been

00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:12,419
willing to be courageous in the change

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,949
but where else can we go and I thought

00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,589
we're still often sitting and having

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,760
dialogue about theoretical things or

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,769
people are coming to me and they're

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,929
letting me know and we're having great

00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:23,669
progress we're still green on developing

00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,829
the product and here's the date it'll go

00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,449
in and I started the year saying you

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,570
know what I want to do when I spend time

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:33,570
with my teams now is I want more touch

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,970
and feel more show and tell and less

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,620
kind of opining over the abstract

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,350
structures that make us all comfortable

00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,269
so let's put away the PowerPoint decks

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,399
and let me just come into the lab and

00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,950
see your latest demo and look at what's

00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:49,200
going on or grab me if you need my

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,269
support for when I'm going into meetings

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,669
or it can advocate or bring the team

00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:55,590
that's also just collapsing the speed we

00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:57,389
have all these tools to collapse the

00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,789
speed of development if we can collapse

00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:02,730
the speed at which management support

00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:05,010
and decisions are made it is so vital to

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,740
our progress there I'm really really

00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,389
excited about the progress we've made

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,190
again my team's been amazing seeing

00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:13,889
individuals that have been in the

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,750
enterprise from brand new hires to

00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:17,929
people that have been with us 25 or more

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,090
years embracing this way of working

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,889
excited thrilled stepping up to the next

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,139
challenge and it's not just us it is

00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:27,269
across the whole enterprise and to me

00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:29,039
this is where when we pull back we see

00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:31,200
the force that's being created by all

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,539
this good health of the individual

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,090
product teams and all that benefit that

00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,919
we get from being part of the ecosystem

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,470
the future's so bright when I can better

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,080
connect what I'm doing in claims with my

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,460
partners in connected car and they can

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,740
connect to what we're doing in roadside

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,539
services and we can connect all of that

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,460
back to the insurance policies we offer

00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:52,500
there's just more and more of our cue

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,049
there to be tapped as the new business

00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,179
opportunities and challenges come it's

00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:59,940
really really exciting we've still got a

00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,980
lot of scaling to do it's far from over

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,419
but it's a really tremendous time I

00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,149
think to be part of this digital

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,789
revolution and like I said it's not just

00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:10,769
how I feel about it it's seen what our

00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:12,690
customers share particularly on social

00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:14,820
media right we get a lot of good stories

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,529
that come through we get some two that

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,480
are concerning that's great feed into

00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:20,639
the product process that helps us adapt

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,250
but I love this first one on the top

00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:25,139
left that someone shared I'm not tech

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,519
savvy at all and I was hesitant when I

00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:28,320
was instructed I mean that already

00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,539
sounds bad right I was instructed to

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,750
work my claim through the app but then

00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:36,059
like oh my god there convert so many

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,980
pieces of people saying with something

00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,269
when you have a claim to begin with

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,669
right that's never the best day of your

00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:44,100
life so when somebody can leave feeling

00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:46,110
happy about the experience then we know

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,600
we've really done done something right

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,250
to turn that around it is like I said

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,470
it's all about the customers at the end

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,070
of the day but it's also really about

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,629
the people at every role at every level

00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,639
it's about really taking care of the

00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,360
developers and the mandate of leadership

00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:02,280
to do that

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,170
to get out of the way and make sure

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,110
we're not in the way and to help hurdle

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,000
other barriers and get there I'm so

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,370
excited to be here I'm excited for the

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,260
program the next day and a half I really

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,059
want to thank all of you members of the

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,190
community and all the folks at the

00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,750
foundry we get so much from being

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,549
members and from having these

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,650
experiences I know we've got people in

00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:24,660
our labs today that are watching the

00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,830
livestream and we'll take so much away

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,120
from this gathering that are going to

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,790
help us on the next stage of our journey

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,190
so I will be back to share in the future

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,529
thank you so much

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,529
