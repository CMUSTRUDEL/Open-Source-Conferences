who says the theme is Beyonc

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:10,740
how about a little bit of Beastie Boys

00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:13,230
whoa now I have an association to that

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,880
song and yeah we need to take a time now

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,070
because I have to I'm a science freaking

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,830
fan you know and there's an association

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:27,449
going back to that song to 1964 1966

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,990
does it ring a bell already 1966 Gene

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,750
Roddenberry Star Trek that was when the

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,380
screen show was first screened on NBC

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:41,610
and it came out as a show which had the

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,530
first diverse cast on TV which was

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,969
revolutionary back then as we were

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,750
talking about diversity and inclusion

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,860
and since then it has been promoting

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:56,610
things of diversity of inclusion of

00:00:51,860 --> 00:01:00,300
humanity it has been promoting the idea

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:03,449
of pushing mankind beyond the known

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,240
limits of what we know it has been

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:11,010
promoting the idea of an ideal the

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,020
United Nations the the Federation of the

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,720
planets basically they try to solve

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,509
problems not by war but actually by

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,650
working collaboratively to solve big

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:25,290
problems and looking at current times

00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,259
and where we are and what's happening

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,320
around the globe of national

00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:33,180
small-mindedness I think it's time that

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,360
we need more Trekkies don't you think so

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,710
as well and following my my association

00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,600
Star Trek I think we started with Star

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:51,750
Trek Star Trek james t kirk spock o'hara

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:55,439
new who are bones Scotty you know these

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,689
were the the heroes of my childhood I

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,070
was really amazed how they were rushing

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:04,469
through these adventure adventures

00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:06,540
racing through space meeting new unknown

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,190
species and artifacts and they had all

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,679
this cool technology and all this stuff

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,450
that was really outrageous and I really

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,800
loved the show back then so it's

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,890
particularly excited

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,670
when in 2009 the new Star Trek movie

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,080
came out

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,370
Star Trek it was kind of using time warp

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,460
storytelling to get us all back to the

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,390
young original Star Trek crew you've all

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,860
seen the movie have you and and it was

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,850
really cool because this was this young

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,620
Kirk I mean this kind of revolting guy

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,930
Wilde and he was with his crew they were

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,270
kicking ass of some space Hellenes and

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,150
and they were kind of breaking some

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,080
rules and breaking federal prime

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:52,140
directive and and kind of disrupting

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,970
some tools or spaceships to get cool

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,930
things done there was really outrageous

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,670
and this song actually it relates to

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,220
these movies there was the Star Trek

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,340
movie in 2009 and there was Star Trek

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,160
beyond this year where they played this

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,110
song as well you remember where they

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,480
played it there's two scenes in the

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,060
movie one is in the Star Trek movie from

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,110
through 2009 and there's the 10 year old

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,660
james t kirk who drives in a Mustang a

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,220
vintage car in a science fiction movie

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,130
of course that he stole from his

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,920
stepfather and he wrecks the car in

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:32,700
Grand Canyon very disruptive to his

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,010
father's budget and the other one was

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,880
when the Star Trek crew in Star Trek

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:42,600
beyond finally tries to protect the

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,120
federal base station or star base out

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,290
there in space from this swarm attack of

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:53,310
robots and they use this song to inject

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:56,250
it as a virus into the into the grid of

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,500
those swarm robots so these were two

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,890
disruptive things so that was just the

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,180
connection I wanted to make to that song

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,190
you have to forgive me I'm German

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,590
sometimes it's complicated coming back

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,810
so now

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:19,150
now okay now we have to hurry up but I

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:21,410
have 15 minutes left i disruption

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,990
disruption I'll make that short you know

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:26,960
all the story is digital economy real is

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,240
it yes or no I think we all agree yes

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,520
it's real digital economy is real it's

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,760
happening is changing the world if you

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,250
compare the five most valued at stock

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,850
market valued companies in 2000 and

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,500
let's say 2011 compared to today in 2011

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:47,419
there were three companies that were

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:49,610
kind of typical non IT companies and

00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,860
there were kind of there's of course at

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,860
the top that was Apple was there but

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,979
then there's ExxonMobil there's a bhp

00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:03,110
billiton there's PetroChina

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:05,810
and who was the first one I believe

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,669
Amazon was already showing up there last

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,100
year different different you those

00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:13,240
classical companies are gone it's Apple

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,010
its Microsoft its Amazon its Facebook

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,260
these are the companies who show up now

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:23,419
as the most valued companies startups

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:25,550
uber Airbnb Facebook you've heard it all

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,470
these companies weren't existing on the

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,380
roadmap 10 years ago to a large extent

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,640
right meanwhile they are valued in the

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,650
billions Airbnb uber more than twenty to

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,380
thirty billion Facebook hundred thirty

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,419
billion these companies are going into

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,880
industries all over the place and they

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:46,460
disrupt companies who have established

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,410
businesses companies 50 years old 100

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,479
years old and these companies start

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,800
wondering what should we do about it we

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,360
need to do something about it you can't

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,160
just sit and wait until you get wiped

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,979
out so you need to get going you need to

00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,419
do something and that's why they are

00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,070
thinking how they can change their

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,560
business can they change business models

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,270
is for example you move from B to B into

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,220
a business to consumer business can they

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,680
change from selling products to selling

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:15,700
services instead of selling drilling

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,840
machines cell holes drilled into a wall

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,220
so they're starting to think how to

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,150
change their business and that's what

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,250
sometimes is referred

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,570
didja transformation right the term we

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,080
can't stand anymore

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,700
now we FTP have gone through that as

00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,500
well sometimes we think of ourselves hey

00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,390
we're an IT company we're doing software

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,100
we're doing all that crazy stuff but but

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,770
frankly we ourselves have gone through

00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,050
the transformation as well this is sa P

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,630
as you do it probably sa P what is this

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,640
a P it's an ERP company right it ends up

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:47,330
here P company that's how we know ASAP

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,340
now we had delivery cycles 10 years ago

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,680
where we had a release every two years

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,910
you know a big release coming out and

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,950
then customers it took them like

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,450
sometimes five years to get it implement

00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,920
or to have its kind of deployed and

00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,040
implemented and active and used by

00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,470
everybody and the time a developer saw

00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,530
between releasing code here and having

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,300
it deployed there two decades I mean it

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,020
take really really really long we were

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,910
selling software up front big upfront

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,770
license revenue big deals where the

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,360
sales folks going out for for big deals

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,910
now we've changed

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,200
we've massively changed that's our own

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,980
transformation that we went through

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,620
because now this is the SA P you need to

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,410
know now we're down to being a cloud

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,570
company and delivering in quarterly

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,100
release cycles we're releasing updates

00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,410
to the software we have in the cloud

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,790
function improvements every two weeks on

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,030
a global scale

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:43,150
we've moved from upfront license to

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,680
subscription and paper use models and

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,260
while it sounds very simple for an

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,630
80,000 people company it's a major

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,670
undertaking to make that change and it's

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,650
not necessarily technology as we've

00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,800
heard but it's people who make it

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,420
different and difficult to change and to

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,120
change in that way and go through that

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:05,120
change and it has gone through all of

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,480
the organization from marketing to sales

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,040
to development to support legal

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,680
convention so the whole company had to

00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,090
basically paint but we went through that

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,160
successfully and we're still on that

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,110
journey and it means we need to stay

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,030
agile and move on so it's not just

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,470
sometimes the brick-and-mortar companies

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,450
you might be thinking of but also in the

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,990
IT industry it's a topic that keeps us

00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:29,720
awake at night so we have our experience

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,990
with them and it's also what we hear and

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,610
what I hear whenever I talk to customers

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,769
if you talk and reach out to their IT

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,589
departments and their CIO is or you talk

00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:42,529
to the line of business heads in n HR or

00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:44,329
finance they basically all go through

00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,850
these kind of considerations how can we

00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:48,920
change our company and how we operate we

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,500
need to be faster we need to change the

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,720
way we do business and Gardner has

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,930
coined the term around that which is

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,970
bimodal IT or two-speed IT and Kinsey

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,649
has a term for that and IDC has a term

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,360
for that and you've all heard that but

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,100
it basically goes back to the problem

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,889
that IT departments are seeing today

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,170
which is somewhat a split brain that

00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:11,810
they need to have on the one hand they

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,430
need to protect the core investments

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,019
that they have they need to protect the

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,449
system they have up and running and that

00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:21,019
keep their poor applications and

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:24,290
processes up and running day and night

00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:26,029
and running the whole core business and

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,420
that's typically where sa P is known

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,740
that's where our ERP system is used by

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,889
300,000 customers around the globe where

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,459
we're in more than 14 industries from

00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:41,360
insurance to retail to gas and oil and

00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:43,279
insurance and public sector but that's

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,990
only what part of what they need to do

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,910
this is whether it to be very predictive

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,410
where governance is necessary where

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,290
compliant is important because you want

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,630
to keep your CFO out of jail ring but

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,490
then they need to change they need to

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,860
change they know they now reached me to

00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,959
reach out to consumers for example they

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,139
need to digitize their business model

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,699
they need to be more visible out there

00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,620
on the street selling products directly

00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:09,019
trains consumers rather than being in a

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,339
b2b business Nestle is a nice example I

00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,870
mean we're all were using nestle

00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:15,259
products and buying them off the shelf

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,819
in a supermarket but ceremony you turn

00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:19,490
it around and try to figure out is this

00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:21,980
a nestle product or not but now you buy

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,560
Nespresso coffee capsules somewhere in

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,259
downtown in the city centers and all of

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,630
a sudden Nestle moved from being a b2b

00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,389
company into moving a b2c company and

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,589
all of a sudden customer experience

00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:35,720
becomes of utmost importance

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,009
right it's a different way that you

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,589
expect that you can engage with a

00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,990
customer with with a company in this

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,240
mode where customer experience and an

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,160
innovation culture is super important

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,660
requires a different working

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,100
in IT departments it's not about

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,050
preserving what you have and not

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,029
exposing it to any risk but this is

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,610
about agility this is about moving fast

00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:58,190
this is about changing things quickly

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,220
testing it out validating it with your

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,560
end-users your consumers fixing it

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,540
adapting it until it works exactly the

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,550
right way and then boom you want to

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,500
scale it as quickly as possible around

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,709
the globe this is this mode to world

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,050
this is where experimentation is much

00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:17,509
more important and this is where

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,860
companies differentiate typically it's

00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,360
where you don't want the standard

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,370
process you don't want to have just the

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,810
standard customer experience that your

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,399
competitor might have but this is where

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,470
you differentiate where you try to be

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,769
special this is where you build as a

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,569
company your own solution because that

00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,439
makes you different and that makes you

00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,170
more competitive

00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:38,120
that's this more two world but

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,790
interestingly this mode two world where

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,699
you reach out into social networks for

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,439
consumer sentiment where you do

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:47,870
front-office things like marketing and

00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:52,069
sales your shop front ends where you

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:54,139
start injecting IOT data into your

00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:55,670
platform to be more telogen about what's

00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:59,389
happening to the machines that you have

00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,980
delivered to your end customers this is

00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:03,880
a world that does not live as an island

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,170
it's not living in isolation right it's

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,850
just collecting sensor data is

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,500
interesting and you can monitor and you

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,959
can start trying to predict what's

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,060
happening based on time series data of

00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,069
your of your Center data but for frankly

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,170
what do you do then what if it goes out

00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,750
of bound what if it hits certain

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,269
thresholds that should ring an alarm

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,040
bell how do you feed that back into your

00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:28,399
core system where you understand that

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,470
this needs a this machine needs service

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,699
and you want to trigger a service

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,649
transaction where you want to engage

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:36,290
with a business partner who provides

00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:37,730
those services to the end customer how

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,470
do you figure out who that customer

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,540
actually is that bought the machine that

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,519
is now kind of creating an issue are

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,519
there upsell opportunities can you

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,500
provide better support contracts for the

00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,540
customer can somebody call that customer

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,059
please so there's always a link between

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,370
the new scenarios the elation scenarios

00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:56,930
on one hand side and the core processes

00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,910
of those companies and you need to

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:02,730
create that link in a secure and control

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,520
so that's the problem to solve now for

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,290
the agility part where you start

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,150
ideation early on and time to market is

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:11,340
of essence and where you then want to

00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:15,030
quickly innovate to come up with a

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,340
Minimum Viable Product and move on we

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,260
figured that Cloud Foundry is actually

00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,140
the ideal base is to realize that

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,050
environment this is a platform which

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,300
allows you to bring in your own

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,630
programming languages of your preference

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,400
where you have open source as providing

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,020
a necessary speed and innovation that's

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,330
driving the platform and your

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,090
capabilities on top fold this is a

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,610
platform where DevOps was considered

00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,110
right from the start which allows you to

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,350
get away from classical IT

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,030
implementation cycles long kind of back

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,270
and forth between development and our IT

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,340
operation operating this solution is not

00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,750
neutral so you can choose where to run

00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,610
the solution whether it's with one of

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,250
the hyper cloud providers or on your own

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,350
data centers and your own IT a solution

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,450
built from ground up with microservices

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,460
in mind that allow you to build those

00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,700
agile micro services to plug together

00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,010
and change individually without bringing

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,320
the whole system down and slowing you

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,150
down so this is where actually we

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,120
thought that Cloud Foundry is absolutely

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:21,540
essential for our customers to get into

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,330
that agile mode so we've started

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,450
engaging with Cloud Foundry early on it

00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:30,890
was a well it wasn't first love at first

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:34,590
sight actually we started early in 2011

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:38,730
looking at Cloud Foundry early on

00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:41,040
due to some IP and and license related

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:45,570
issues we didn't engage with it fully so

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,700
that initial love faded away for a short

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:51,240
moment it was a little one of these

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:55,260
on-off on things like with Uhura and

00:14:51,240 --> 00:15:00,780
Spock in the star trek into darkness

00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:04,770
movie or or han Solo different universe

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:08,070
and Solo and Princess Leia we've seen

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:10,400
what can come out of this but then when

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,320
the foundation idea was actually created

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,380
we were coming back together

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,270
sa P when we were approached immediately

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,190
jumped on this because we thought this

00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,070
is a great thing that's happening in the

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:27,680
community we became a platinum sponsor

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:31,740
or on the Cloud Foundry board of cause

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,780
we have quickly become sa P cloud Cloud

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,900
Foundry is certified with the sa p cloud

00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:42,150
platform in 2015 and the last story

00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:45,210
continues we opened a dojo lab in

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,940
Germany I'm so a part of spreading the

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:50,880
news and making sure we get additional

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:55,230
black belts on board quickly we just

00:15:50,880 --> 00:16:02,400
recently released Zeman's mind sphere

00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:04,290
that's the IOT cloud of demons on top of

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,070
the sa p cloud platform cloud foundry as

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:10,740
the first product and now we have a TA

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,360
release of Cloud Foundry out there and

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,630
the market I have more about this now

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,880
we're expecting let's see what comes out

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,800
of this we were still trying to figure

00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,990
out who is who who is Cloud Foundry who

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,810
is sa P and maybe we get some hints

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,940
afterwards so now what are we doing we

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,490
were contributing a lot so most of the

00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,050
improvements we've made in the platform

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,270
itself in Cloud Foundry itself we

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,250
contributed back as good open-source

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,290
members so we're very very active here

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,390
we're currently doubling the number of

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,920
full-time committers we have as I

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,540
mentioned already we believe it's

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,140
important to spread the news and get

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:50,010
more experts into Cloud Foundry so we

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:52,380
opened the dojo in Germany where a big

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,910
contributor to a number of projects here

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,010
we're leading some of them so we're

00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:00,090
together with Sousa we're running the

00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,950
Bosch OpenStack CPI our latest

00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,260
contribution now is the service fabric

00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:07,410
to also make it easier to run

00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,880
instantiation of backing services in

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,709
this environment because of course it's

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,000
in the end you need to get something up

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,640
and running which is bigger than what's

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,290
out found recovers working together on

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,329
topics like the app autoscaler very

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,310
important of course in large-scale

00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:25,650
environments and the app auto sleep

00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,350
quite frankly is also equally important

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,939
because

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,649
everything that's up and running and

00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,350
deployed creates cost because you need

00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:33,759
infrastructure underneath and for a

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,230
service provider this is of course

00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,960
something you want to minimize so we

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,779
need to also be able to hibernate

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,610
certain services again so we're working

00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:46,179
here in contributing to a large extent

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:48,370
now agility as we talked about it

00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:50,710
earlier is only part of the of the

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,480
equation so what we need to look into is

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,210
what's happening at those customers and

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,740
that's where it becomes interesting

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,649
digitalization means every company

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,259
becomes a software driven company by

00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:05,169
intelligently connecting people things

00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:06,820
and businesses and now you need three

00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,590
minutes to read that sentence and think

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,210
about it again I hated it in the

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,590
beginning because I thought it's so unta

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,240
key but it's a great sentence to

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,179
describe what digitalization is about

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,980
and what it takes because what it takes

00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:20,230
is all these things that are underneath

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,730
you can't beat elegent if they're if

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,330
there is no real-time data in your

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,789
platform

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,529
if there is no real-time analytics on

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:27,730
top of it and it takes you two weeks to

00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:30,850
come up with an answer to a question

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,559
that's not very intelligent with more

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,210
and more machine data you need machine

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,860
learning on the platform otherwise who

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,950
is making up what's going on in those

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,750
data time sequences right connecting

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,519
means security in the end you need to

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,500
see how all of that doesn't live in

00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,690
isolation but links left and right into

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,429
existing legacy systems into your other

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,320
clouds are solutions that you're living

00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,629
with how do you integrate that it's

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,000
about people user experience customer

00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:56,860
experience collaboration mobile all

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,830
these services need to be part of what

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,740
needs to be solved in digitalization

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,169
projects IOT you have new business

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,230
models models right if you go to paper

00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:09,669
use paper use for a drilling machine

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,320
it's a different model that you need to

00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:13,570
support in your environment than selling

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,690
the machines somewhere through a home

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:19,450
depot right you work with new ecosystems

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,460
like Cloud Foundry itself creates an

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,009
ecosystem of application developers you

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,870
meet api's and micro services so it's a

00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:28,629
broad set of capabilities that you need

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,669
and that's what we're after that's what

00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:31,090
I say P is actually bringing to the

00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,970
table

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:37,330
we take Cloud Foundry as the core of our

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:39,220
cloud offering as an open platform with

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,180
all its benefit of a huge community

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,460
that's driving it

00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,170
of other commercial offerings that help

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,150
drive an ecosystem and create more

00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,190
knowledgeable people about it that

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:51,010
created demand for solutions in that

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,710
space flexible runtimes because us

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:55,630
developers have preferences have choices

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,360
there are trends coming up languages

00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,890
coming and going so you can't be static

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,530
you don't want to be too limited on that

00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,350
and micro services as a basis of all of

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,510
them then we put business services and

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,280
capabilities on top of this things like

00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,950
machine learning services things like

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,220
IOT services to connect devices manage

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,470
devices the whole topic of analytics on

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,640
top of the data big data itself that

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,280
needs to be managed in such an

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,940
environment think in-memory databases

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,230
think Hadoop big spark think all the

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,150
databases out of the open-source

00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:32,380
community that in the end are managed

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:34,690
and used together to bring a solution to

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,310
life so that is much much more than

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,770
actually just your running application

00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:41,290
that you need to consider this is the SA

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,940
P cloud platform and since our customers

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:45,250
tell us it's important to them where

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,370
that solution in the end runs it was

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,620
important to us to also support various

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,600
infrastructure providers underneath to

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,910
run those solutions so what we're

00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,800
providing is s ap cloud platform that

00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:02,500
only in SA P data centers around the

00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:04,660
globe but also on AWS so we release that

00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,490
four weeks ago as a general available

00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,310
release so you can run sa P cloud

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:12,880
platform Cloud Foundry on top of Amazon

00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:15,040
so we provide that out of the box we

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,870
announced a beta and we heard Microsoft

00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,490
talk about it earlier as well we

00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,950
announced that same solution on

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,750
Microsoft Azure as a beta and we

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,180
announced the intent to do the same

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,730
thing with Google cloud platform for the

00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,340
near future we're already working on

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,310
that one so we'll be confident to give

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,230
that to you pretty soon as well now what

00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,990
we're doing here is not just multi-cloud

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,630
in the sense of this is enabled to run

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:43,630
everywhere we run it as a managed

00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,610
service for you in those environments so

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,110
you can get rid of worrying about how to

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,090
run the underlying Cloud Foundry

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,800
infrastructure how to run all those

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,290
services that were providing but you get

00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,660
this basically as a service so this is

00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,540
an

00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:59,420
to prize platform as a service offering

00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,450
that we're bringing to the table here on

00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:06,400
top we have development tools that bring

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:09,050
this across for for all the services a

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,000
it's called sa P built and web by EE

00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,700
which is our cloud-based development

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,160
environment to is an API so everything

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,800
is available and accessible via standard

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,660
based ap is a central cockpit where all

00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,550
those services the operations for

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,430
service providers and developers alike

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:27,350
is provided and a commerce and

00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:29,840
marketplace which is super important

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:32,600
because it allows an ecosystem of

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,880
solution providers to also bring their

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,100
solutions into our customer base so if

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,710
you are an ISP or you are a partner who

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,630
wants to deliver solutions into these 14

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,460
industries or one of the 14 industries

00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,710
to one of those 300,000 customers

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,080
there's a marketplace there is an app

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,740
store it's called App Center available

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,390
where you can bring in your solution

00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,980
there's a commercial model behind it so

00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,990
charging billing all of that is

00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,960
available an automatic deployment of

00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,450
your solution into the platform for our

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,620
customers market play is super important

00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,980
and we believe that this is also

00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:09,490
something which is important for the

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,960
Cloud Foundry community at large and

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:15,220
will help us create an ecosystem around

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:18,740
it so this is what we're doing here

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,450
now we use that to build new solutions

00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,710
our customers use that to build new

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:26,780
solutions to extend the S ap application

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,850
portfolios or ERP solutions are extended

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,190
on this platform in micro services and

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,990
we use that to integrate new solutions

00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,780
on the platform with our core

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,850
applications so as I said before it's

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,530
never that any of those new innovative

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,960
solutions you're building in that space

00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:44,180
are isolated or wouldn't link back into

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,120
your core applications your solutions

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:49,130
your on-premise ERP or s4 HANA system

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,260
from sa P this is what the platform

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,510
provides to you and then it's very easy

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,040
to extend one of those solutions so if

00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,990
you happen to have an ERP back-end

00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,910
somewhere within your company and I

00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,400
think there's a number there's a good

00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:04,940
probability that that many of you have

00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,290
that it's an easy way to connect out of

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,910
our cloud and you

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,340
the hyper cloud provider infrastructures

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,560
underneath into your course systems via

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,410
this platform this is the value we bring

00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,350
in now this picture I will now explain

00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,960
in detail no I will not

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:23,840
the this was just put in to give me some

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,880
technical credibility I couldn't explain

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,530
it it should just tell you one story

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,840
first is you can print it out and you

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,540
can use the backside to take notes but

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,280
it also tells you it's complicated there

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,680
is a lot of I mean what looks nice on an

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,870
architecture picture as you all know if

00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,580
you've ever tried to build something on

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,530
top of the platform or within the

00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,530
platform there's many many moving parts

00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,870
can you see this this is great here and

00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,430
you should see our team sitting here in

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,340
the audience those are the guys with

00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:54,410
really gray hair it's hard to get all of

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,960
that integrated and Enterprise graded

00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,760
and get that ready and up and running on

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,920
all those infrastructures so we know

00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,500
it's a lot of effort so there's value in

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:06,290
providing this as a service as a managed

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,230
service to you in a public cloud

00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,810
environment that's just a caveat to not

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:15,500
try to do these things probably on your

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:18,560
own now I wanted to take the opportunity

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,000
here maybe I go back to show you what we

00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,530
are actually doing with that what are we

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,440
doing those services maybe we can

00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:26,750
quickly play that movie we have prepared

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,700
this is a product called SAT brand

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,260
impact and this shows how machine

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,900
learning is actually applied in an

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,580
enterprise context as you can see with

00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,930
these rectangles what we're doing is

00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,960
we're using machine learning and

00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:42,280
training of algorithms to detect company

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,690
logo brand logos in sports events and

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,300
these brands are paying a lot of money

00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:50,570
to actually figure out for how many

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:54,020
minutes or seconds was my logo visible

00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:55,760
because they pay per second that a logo

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,890
is visible during some of those events

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,080
and there's interns actually in the past

00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,270
who were kind of sitting there with

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,090
stopwatches

00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:06,680
taking note of when is the logo of s AP

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,110
or when is the logo of Cloud Foundry

00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:12,470
showing up in some of those sports

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:14,390
events on some side banners and we can

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,940
detect that automatically and feed it

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:18,590
back into our marketing solution

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,880
automatically and that's how we think

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,559
about building you

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,230
various solutions on top of the platform

00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:27,020
leveraging machine learning algorithms

00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,580
big data linking that back into the

00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:32,030
solution so that it was not just one

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,590
example now what I want to conclude with

00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,220
and I'm already seven minutes over time

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:40,520
only attributed to my explanation of the

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:42,500
of the Beastie Boys on what I want to

00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,330
conclude with what I want you to take

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,880
with you is it's basically following si

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:49,460
P we're totally committed to the cloud

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,890
family community this is super according

00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:55,190
to us because it's super important to

00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:57,350
our customers it's part of the strategy

00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,179
that we support them in their digital

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,530
transformation in all the innovation

00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:02,870
projects that they are currently doing

00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:05,510
and they are happening in all the

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,270
industries in some of them it's a

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:10,520
hurricane that's currently going through

00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:13,940
take think retail think banking in

00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:16,360
others it's a storm or a very strong

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:19,429
wind maybe if you go down the b2b

00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,850
direction and go deeper into whatever

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,500
gas and oil or public sector but it's

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,289
coming in all those industries and it's

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,330
super important and we believe that the

00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:31,309
challenges in those industries can only

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:33,470
be overcome if we have a different way

00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:37,220
of thinking a different culture a more

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:39,409
agile way of doing things and a platform

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,390
as a service offering like si P cloud

00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:45,289
platform and cloud foundry as the

00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:47,929
underlying path operating system as I

00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:49,429
would say this is key this is absolutely

00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:51,590
important to getting these problems

00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:54,710
solved and then it takes you it takes

00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:56,740
developers to get the magic term because

00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,640
we talked about differentiating any

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,799
innovative solution it's not about

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,480
running the boring old stuff it's about

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,549
getting these fancy new things going

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,289
coming up with great ideas and what you

00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:09,169
build you want to do that in a quick

00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:10,820
fashion and in the end we all don't do

00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:12,530
this probably because we're altruistic

00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,250
and we think it's great technology let's

00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,720
keep going

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,299
but in the end there's business behind

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,980
these things so there's the need for a

00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:21,890
commercial model there's need for a

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,210
partner ecosystem we need support in the

00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,950
end it's not about building everything

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,049
individual but building a huge

00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,150
application portfolio that you can

00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:31,929
deploy into many providers cloud

00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:33,650
environments that is why the diverse

00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:35,750
provider because

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,150
of Cloud Foundry is also of utmost

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,130
importance and if we all collaborate

00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,470
together and work jointly together we

00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:44,900
can create actually more for the

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,430
industry than just the sum of the

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,160
individual pieces that we bring to the

00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:51,410
table super important now if you are now

00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,990
interested what SI p is doing in that

00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,910
space I can recommend you to go to one

00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,470
of our 17 sessions we have scheduled

00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,210
here so our experts are here on the

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,030
ground a great opportunity to network

00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,180
around machine learning IOT blockchain

00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,370
Big Data the platform itself of course

00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,050
how it fits together and there's a fancy

00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,510
name which could only be coming from a

00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:13,640
German company which is polyglot

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,770
in-memory application so if you've been

00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,260
wondering what's in there this is where

00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:22,940
these things are actually happening I

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:25,550
wish you a great summit here a network

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,500
as Abby has said take the opportunity to

00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,270
talk to other expert left and wide

00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,670
exchange experiences it's a great

00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,650
opportunity I love to be here at this

00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:39,130
event and then we can hopefully

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:42,860
hopefully all boldly CF push push what

00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,850
no one has ever CF pushed before thank

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,330
you for listening

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,330
