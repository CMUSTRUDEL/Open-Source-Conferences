Description: 
	Comcast Cloud Foundry Journey - Part 2 - Greg Otto, Comcast   

It is hard to believe that Comcast is on the third year of our Cloud Foundry Journey! Our platform has scaled 490% in 2016 and has enabled development teams to improve productivity and time-to-market by as much as 75%! However, this is yesterday's news and our developers want more. Our focus has shifted to engaging closer with the developer community, expanding the platform by creating new capabilities and contributing back to the open source community, all with less than a handful of resources! Come talk to us about our lessons learned, how weâ€™ve tapped into the passions of our developer community, our strategy for changing our focus to expand the platform to deliver even more services and business value! All of this while still keeping the lights on.

all right so good afternoon I'm Greg

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:09,690
Otto and I lead the cloud platform

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,940
engineering team at Comcast and I have

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,880
responsibilities for our pivotal Cloud

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,640
Foundry environment it's really an honor

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,199
to be here any of the folks roaming

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,199
around outside if you want to come on in

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,820
so I'm really excited to be able to

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:32,910
share with you an update on our journey

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:35,040
since last year and again you know we

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,890
have the whole team here all four of

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,600
them so we're really excited to talk to

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,989
folks and you know we're going to be

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,030
here

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,590
for the rest of the conference so I'm

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,420
going to leave plenty of time at the end

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,590
for Q&A so please make sure that you if

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,989
you're not going to ask questions during

00:00:49,590 --> 00:01:00,420
the session feel free to stop us when

00:00:51,989 --> 00:01:06,630
we're walking around the conference so

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:09,380
for those that don't know love it when

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,380
the clicker doesn't work

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:26,990
so Comcast is a global and NBCUniversal

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,320
is a global median technology company

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:32,420
and a lesser known fact is that we

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,360
actually have the world's largest IP

00:01:32,420 --> 00:02:07,910
network it will be really awesome if my

00:01:38,360 --> 00:02:10,790
slides were working Rob sure yes so you

00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:13,190
know we were here last year so this is

00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,410
you know part 2 I am definitely not in

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,950
marketing because the title my session

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,930
kinda stinks but yeah last year when we

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,120
were here we were talking about our

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,489
journey so I spent you know quite a bit

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,790
of time talking about how do we get

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,620
involved with Cloud Foundry and how do

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,200
we just start what were some of the

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,850
challenges and then today when I want to

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,790
share is I'm gonna briefly cover that

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,880
and then I want to focus more on kind of

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,790
where we've been since last year and

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,920
then what we're you know some of the

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,840
things that we're working on now some of

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,750
the changes in scope and scale for those

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,400
that may have seen us in the in the

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,580
keynote with the panel we gave some

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,430
facts and figures but this allows us an

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,380
opportunity to provide more detail more

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,380
granular detail and again an opportunity

00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,180
to have an interactive discussion which

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:13,370
you know we really can't have on the

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:15,380
main stage so again Comcast we have a

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,090
lot of different products and services

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,330
across you know all the different

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,030
entities that we have so we have a lot

00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:27,160
of great stories to share and with

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:29,790
respect to our adoption of cloud foundry

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:33,310
so for us it started again briefly in

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,980
2013 we had some real challenges around

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,470
our legacy applications we had some

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,650
brittle applications that were causing

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,440
impacts to both the business and then

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,760
also for our end customers so the

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,130
challenge from the business was hey you

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,110
know we need better stability we need

00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,300
more resiliency around the applications

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,010
that are being delivered to our

00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,510
customers and supporting our care

00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:00,010
organization so that was a huge focus

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,720
but we also knew that this was a

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,970
transformation and I say this all the

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,670
time not just of the technology but

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:09,280
people as well so we were very committed

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,860
to investing in our development

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,360
organization creating a safe environment

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,430
to change mindset and work in a new way

00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,380
with these newer methodologies around

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,600
agile development and all the modern

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,490
best practices for depaul factor apps

00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,490
test-driven development and so forth

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,180
so I'm going to share some of the things

00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,440
that worked well and then we're also

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,750
going to share some of the things that

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,180
maybe they can go so well some lessons

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,720
learned and hopefully that will help you

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,780
in your journey so as we go through from

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,400
the part one up to up till now we'll

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,210
highlight some of those some of those

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,610
things so in 2014 we got the foundation

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,530
laid and that wasn't just with the

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,140
technology in the infrastructure it was

00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,170
with getting agreement from our business

00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,850
partners at the executive level on what

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,260
were the things what were the metrics

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,030
that they wanted to measure our success

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,820
by right so we heard about the

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,790
resiliency time-to-market was certainly

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,220
a key element there and then of course

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:18,100
with Comcast we have challenges around

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:19,570
scale so we one of the things that went

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,180
really really well was that we started

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,690
this journey together so this is hard

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,490
stuff there's no magic pixie dust so you

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:32,710
definitely want to bring lots of friends

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:35,290
and you know going at this in a better

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,970
together type of approach is you know

00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:41,270
really the best way to go that's my best

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:43,880
advice and then again what we learned

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,370
you know starting small getting some of

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,250
the DevOps teams you know early adopters

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:54,979
was really key build success with them

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:57,560
first in 2015 and we started to move

00:05:54,979 --> 00:06:01,669
some of the first services over and

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,590
again what worked well was we tackled

00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:07,490
not just the easy things we didn't want

00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,289
to just you know get some easy wins we

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,560
wanted to focus on some real high value

00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:14,990
targets and I think Chris shared during

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,500
our keynote that we picked three

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,419
services to move and those were the

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,210
services that were very very active it

00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:25,460
represented about 40% or about a hundred

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,199
million transactions on one of our

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,289
critical platforms that process around

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,949
250 million transactions a day so those

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:36,470
3 services are part of over a hundred

00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:38,449
services in a monolithic application

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,849
that we decided to move so it was pretty

00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:43,370
ambitious definitely want to pick

00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:45,889
high-value targets your ambition level

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,360
might not be as high but you definitely

00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,820
want to pick things that are meaningful

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,060
that you can demonstrate that business

00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:56,270
value one of the things that we learned

00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:00,320
really quickly was don't try to boil the

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:02,060
ocean don't take on things that are even

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,940
more complicated so for us what that

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,949
meant was deferring the data persistence

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,250
issues until after the initial

00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:12,979
migrations so that allowed us to realize

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:17,060
value more quickly and be able to start

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:20,120
to see what success and the the expected

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,620
outcomes would be as we started to move

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,620
some of the first services over

00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:30,399
20:16 for us was a huge breakout year

00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:33,219
you're going to see that in our

00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,139
operational metrics that we really

00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:38,679
stepped on the gas we moved a ton of

00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,749
services a ton of traffic over our most

00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:43,360
business critical and customer critical

00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:47,019
services that I'm also going to show are

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,059
all running on this platform activation

00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:51,099
systems order entry systems any of the

00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:52,959
customer kind of transactions that flow

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,599
through our back-office

00:07:52,959 --> 00:08:00,099
our services that we've moved onto this

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:02,139
platform some of the things that we

00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:05,409
learned and went well really well was

00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:08,110
around embracing and accelerating the

00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:09,969
DevOps culture so realizing the benefits

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,779
of shifting things left with test-driven

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:15,939
development pair programming and then of

00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:18,429
course the CI CD pipelines getting those

00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:23,079
established realizing the benefits of

00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:25,779
having an effective CI CD process one of

00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:29,409
the things that we learned was to

00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:31,119
include the BAU teams up front so again

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:33,360
bringing things in you know bringing

00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:35,889
teams in earlier it's really a big help

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,719
definitely want to make sure that again

00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,659
the more folks that you include and the

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,829
earlier that you do that the better that

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,829
your journey will be as well

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,190
so here are some of our operational

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,820
metrics I will get to the business

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,260
outcomes that's kind of the big reveal

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,050
we shared some of these metrics last

00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,000
year and they're significantly different

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,720
so we had about four hundred and ninety

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,290
percent growth last year and then you

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,029
can see from the top that we started our

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,770
journey on our internal private cloud

00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:13,110
there's some other folks that have

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,779
actually started their journey on public

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,899
cloud and are moving things internal so

00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:21,899
our journey is kind of the reverse

00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:23,580
most of our foundry environment and the

00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,130
transactions that are flowing through it

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:29,010
are still running predominantly on our

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,740
private cloud but over the last couple

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,630
of years again based on feedback from

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,940
the development teams we've enabled

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:39,540
multi cloud delivery to include cloud

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,339
and multiple cloud providers so that's a

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,010
trend that we expect to continue and

00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,740
again it's really all about choice so

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,660
cloud foundry for us enables that choice

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,510
so the developers can still focus on

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,130
their code and their applications and

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,010
building awesome products that deliver

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,089
new experiences for our customers and

00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,500
they don't have to worry about what

00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,779
cloud provider that they're running on

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,270
so that was really powerful for us and

00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:06,000
we're starting to see some of the

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:11,640
application teams actually move it to a

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,350
multi cloud delivery model so again you

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,270
know the application growth total hockey

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:20,430
stick right insane level of growth there

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,140
the number of developers the number of

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,029
developers has grown significantly I

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,980
think when I gave this talk last year I

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,240
probably should have remembered with the

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,970
with the number one I think it was

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,490
somewhere around 400 developers now we

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,870
have over 1500 developers that are

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:40,260
innovating on our platform every day and

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,000
one of the really proud pieces for me is

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,279
calling out our slackers they're

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,720
actually not slackers we use slack for

00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,990
real-time communication and

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,560
collaboration and we created a slack

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:55,140
channel for cloud foundry we have over

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,360
we have almost 800 people I don't know

00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,279
it may have gone over 800 since

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,980
you know beginning of the conference but

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,079
having first of all having over half of

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,060
your customer base actively

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,399
communicating and collaborating in real

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,459
time on a daily basis is pretty

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,320
incredible but what's really rewarding

00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:14,910
for me and this was not a planned

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,760
outcome it just was something that

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,550
happened it was a residual benefit but

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,649
it's really a another transformational

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,060
moment for us because it's changing the

00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,540
way that we're communicating and

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,180
collaborating so we have development

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,560
teams that are otherwise never talking

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,959
to each other because they're working on

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,700
separate products and not only are they

00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,200
helping each other with respect to Cloud

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,540
Foundry but they're helping each other

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,209
with what are some of the best practices

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,700
around application design what are some

00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:46,500
of the techniques that they're using

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,750
they're sharing across these different

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,649
product teams so that's really pretty

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,959
awesome and then some of the application

00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:59,040
teams like uma and Chris that were on

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:01,440
stage with me on Tuesday they've taken

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,329
it a step further and they've created

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,940
their own product channels for their

00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,519
individual products that literally

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,620
hundreds of developers are working

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,399
aligning to this product so instead of

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,420
just a scrum of scrums type of format

00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,519
these development teams are

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,470
communicating collaborating in real time

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,839
they're seeing issues they're able to

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,300
know what's going on and be able to jump

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,370
in and help and you'll really streamline

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,959
the delivery and again you're going to

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,420
see that in some of our business alpha

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,370
metrics in a moment

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,870
but it's totally transformed how the

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,470
development teams are working with each

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:39,480
other so you know that again the

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,579
transformation is you know not just

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,260
around the technology but the people and

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:46,140
also the way in which we work in a way

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,690
in which we collaborate and it's even

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:54,420
more open than what I would have

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:58,050
envisioned it to be I'd be remiss if I

00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,310
didn't point out that I don't need more

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,199
than one hand to count the number of

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:04,050
folks from my team that actually support

00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:06,630
all this insane growth all the

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,620
developers that we have any applications

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:11,880
that were onboarding

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:15,670
so those folks are up here in the front

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:18,720
hopefully took separate flights but uh

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,580
it really is an honor and a privilege

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,900
because I do push them hard it really is

00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,960
an honor and a privilege for me to have

00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,720
such talented people working on the team

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,340
and you know I know that the trust that

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,110
the business partners have with us is

00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,060
just off the charts so and that's a

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,740
testament to the folks that are actually

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,910
doing the work I just get to stand up

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,910
here and take the credit for it

00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:46,990
so we can to make this real these

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,210
applications are right in the business

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,090
and customer critical path they're

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:55,150
running real applications both

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,830
supporting our frontline employees the

00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,090
people that are taking phone calls or

00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,150
the people that are in your home's

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:03,120
installing product and then we also have

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,220
some direct customer facing applications

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,470
some of the URLs that you go to right

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,140
now today they are running on our

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:15,010
platform so things like the splash page

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,360
for the Xfinity stream app and you know

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,210
a bunch of the other things that are up

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,570
there they're you know absolutely in the

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,580
customer critical path and again I think

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,470
that I pointed out at Abbie I had told

00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,650
Abby that we were around 180 million

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:32,080
transactions a day that was maybe a

00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,240
couple of months ago and now we've

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,380
gained I don't know where but thirty

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,910
million additional transactions a day so

00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,710
you know the growth as she saw was just

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:46,150
phenomenal and it keeps growing and

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:47,890
growing so last year I was talking about

00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,780
tens of millions of transactions a day

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,150
and now I'm talking about hundreds of

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,500
millions of transactions today I get a

00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,020
little bit queasy when I think about

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,620
what next year might be but it's pretty

00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:03,910
exciting and we'll probably still have

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:07,030
four people spraying the platform all

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:09,550
right to the big reveal so some of the

00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:13,990
business outcomes that we've been able

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,940
to capture and to share first thing was

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,500
a resiliency that was the biggest that

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,920
was the biggest issue that the business

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,950
had

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,410
and I know that there's a few folks like

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,730
Chris and human and my team that were a

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:30,110
little nervous because we actually

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,790
committed to an 40% reduction in the

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,339
amount of time that our applications

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,470
were being impacted by outages and those

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:39,740
outages were impacting our customers as

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:43,630
well so I'm not going to read them all

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:46,880
off but just to put it in the context an

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:50,709
81% reduction in the amount of time that

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,110
our applications were impacted is huge

00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:55,760
but then when you add the fact that when

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,970
we did have issues the teams were able

00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,980
to solve them twice as fast and the

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,290
occurrences in terms of frequency was

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,949
happening half as much so we definitely

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:12,920
got like a huge you know check mark on

00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:18,709
resiliency totally you know even my wild

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:21,860
expectations far surpassed so then time

00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:23,570
to market business always wants to be

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,390
able to deliver new experiences to our

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:29,810
customers faster this is an average

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:32,120
across the platform so the average

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,730
across our platform is about a 50% time

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,269
to market improvement pretty significant

00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:40,250
there are some of the applications that

00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:43,610
are off the charts transformational so

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,339
taking an idea and putting it into a

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:50,570
product as a feature or a new service

00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:53,620
that we offer that process sometimes

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,089
could I've seen it take 3-4 months and

00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,490
now that takes less than two weeks

00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:00,410
there's instances that we have that much

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,290
of a transformational difference between

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:06,410
idea to feature so big big

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,870
transformation and another thing I want

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,850
to call out is that developer happiness

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,799
right so everybody talks about happy

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,990
employees are generally more productive

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,740
and we've been able to put real metrics

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:21,319
behind it to show that the developers

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,750
that have anywhere from 50 to 75 percent

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,419
improvement in productivity because

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,549
they're not working on assembling all

00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:30,860
the infrastructure pieces that are not

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,929
doing transactional tickets to get work

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,280
done

00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:36,710
those happy developers are able to get

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,530
things out to market twice as fast on

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,750
average and sometimes a lot faster than

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,820
that so that's definitely pretty trim

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,620
pretty transformational and then again

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:50,480
just because Chris numr are sitting here

00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:52,929
one of the examples is our services

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,190
platform that's in the middle of

00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:57,650
basically every customer interaction

00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,920
that's the 250 million transactions a

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:03,260
day that's running on that platform that

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,920
specific example is on the board there

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,510
so there used to be 18 releases a year

00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,840
which is was an enormous and I work

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:14,420
across many teams in a fairly well

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,170
refined process but using older

00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,850
methodologies that same application

00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:24,050
product and all the development teams

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:26,840
that we've enabled to relearn adopt

00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:30,200
newer methodologies are now they won 120

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,420
in a senior so features are getting back

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,730
to the business that much faster to our

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,040
end customers that much faster

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,440
the experience is improving for our

00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:45,010
customers that much faster so huge

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:49,130
transformational change there and then

00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:51,920
scale is pretty important it's important

00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:55,730
to note that these applications that are

00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:59,360
scaling an incredible pace that we're

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,280
improving our resiliency and then

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,790
accelerating time to market they're not

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,340
sitting still right so those same

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,660
applications that are on the platform

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:12,559
while we're moving them to the platform

00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:15,320
have seen an average increase almost

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,730
threefold so scale is really really

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,360
important for us and to be able to do

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,890
all of these things at the same time in

00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,170
a fairly short window

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,830
I think it's focus about a year I think

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:29,929
right so you know it's pretty it's a

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,940
pretty proud moment for us and I got a

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:33,320
big update from last year that we're

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,870
able to you know we're happy to share

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,150
these these metrics and these business

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,130
outcomes that the business challenged

00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,590
with and the team totally knocked that

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:48,430
out apart so

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:50,680
it's pretty exciting now I'm gonna shift

00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:53,770
focus on where are we at now and what's

00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,960
next I want to share more granular

00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,760
insight into how we manage the platform

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,430
and some of the things that we're doing

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,480
to try and deliver even more services

00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,570
and some of the things that we've

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,820
recently done so what this picture

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:10,960
really depicts is that even with that

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,600
insane ridiculous growth that we had the

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,880
four people that we have supporting the

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,490
platform we're actually spending less

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,700
time managing and running the platform

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,010
and more time with the developers and

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,180
understanding what their needs are we're

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,150
working with them in the real-time

00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:31,780
collaboration environment every single

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:34,900
day and it's really just it's

00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:37,530
unbelievable to even say this but we

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:40,630
probably spend about 80% of the time

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,640
over the last year with the development

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,370
teams understanding what their needs

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,650
aren't delivering new services even with

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,540
that that growth which again it's a

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,440
testament to the talent of the folks

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,440
that we have on the team

00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:59,909
so what are some of the ways that we're

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:01,590
expanding the platform I'm happy to

00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:04,409
announce and this just timing is

00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,090
everything and nithya is here and

00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:08,820
certainly was a big part of helping us

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,049
give back to the Cloud Foundry community

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:15,539
so Sergey who's sitting right here

00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:18,630
definitely want to talk to him we've

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:21,720
open-sourced Telegraph for both the bill

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:24,260
PACs as well as for bas deployment and

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,730
what that means in English is that when

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:29,220
application teams spin up applications

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,809
on our Cloud Foundry environment one of

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,120
the things that they requested from us

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:34,769
is that hey those same metrics and

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,659
telemetry dashboards that you share with

00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:40,620
us it would be awesome if we had that

00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:42,450
for our applications and because of the

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,750
integration with the build pack and bas

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,820
deployments now within moments of birth

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,590
anyone that deploys an application onto

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,630
the platform automatically gets these

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,059
metrics and it all happens automatically

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:57,179
and it's no effort on that developers

00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:59,159
part huge transformation and again I'm

00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,350
happy to say that that's all open

00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:04,500
sourced and available for you all to use

00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:08,490
and hopefully you know add value to your

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,289
development teams there's a few other

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,880
pieces that I wanted to call out I'm not

00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:15,090
going to name every single one of them

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,669
one on the slide here but we started to

00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,529
use Cloud Foundry kind of even beyond

00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:21,330
just the platform itself so using

00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:24,539
components of Cloud Foundry to deliver

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,370
services even outside of the platform

00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:28,740
and actually a really good example we've

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:32,159
heard about Kubo in the conference was

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,539
taken the pieces of Bosh and you know

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,080
you a a from Cloud Foundry

00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:38,399
authentication and authorization and

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,230
delivering value for spinning up

00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:43,889
kubernetes clusters with a single

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:46,260
command so that same pattern we've used

00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:47,940
to deliver some other services that

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,370
we've provided first within our Cloud

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,620
Foundry environment and then shortly

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,210
after to the rest of our environment

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,120
things like global load balancing is a

00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:00,679
service so we talked about 12 factor

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,600
apps multi-site application deployments

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,220
now we enable a programmatic way for

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,110
people to be able to global you know get

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,309
that global low barreled services

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,080
so that they can spread their

00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:13,559
applications wide across multiple

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,630
availability zones and the global loop

00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:19,380
balancing services is not a ticket based

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:21,450
transaction and that's being expanded to

00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,710
not just the Cloud Foundry environment

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:28,260
so that's really key then there's a few

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:31,950
others there one I want to talk about

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:34,080
real quick is generally myrrh so Neville

00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:37,169
who's sitting up here as well he wrote

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,210
that and folks may have heard of Kaos

00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:41,429
lemur that runs around breaks the

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,039
environment test the resiliency to make

00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:46,529
sure things are functional we create a

00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:49,980
janitor lemur which runs around and does

00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:51,570
clean up because sorry but the

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,610
developers can be sometimes a little

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,130
messy and we're lazy we don't want to

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,960
possibly sweep up after them so this

00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,549
takes the application instances that

00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,080
haven't really been doing anything and

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:03,149
goes and cleans them up for us because

00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,960
it's so easy to deploy new ones anyway

00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:09,059
and it allows us to spend even more time

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,980
cuddling up to our developer friends and

00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,600
helping them deliver these awesome

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,000
experiences to our customers in the

00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:19,139
business and that's something that is

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,510
going to be in process to be contributed

00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:24,510
back to the open-source community so

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:26,700
with you know help from our friends like

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,019
nithya you can get that push through and

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,750
make that available so we're really

00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:34,169
happy about being contributing back to

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:38,039
the community and we hope to get the

00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:40,620
generally more open sourced quickly so

00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:43,159
that you all can benefit from a little

00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,159
bit of cleanup

00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,740
so more insight more granularity in

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:55,980
terms of how do we manage the platform

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:58,050
so this slide depicts our overall

00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,380
architecture and strategy for metrics

00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:03,360
and telemetry and the strategy is really

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,780
best depicted with the elements on top

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,690
right the status and notification

00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:11,970
eventing and then the trend analysis

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:14,910
that we use most of this is all open

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,680
source one of the things that we learned

00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:20,370
really quickly is that there's no one

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,900
tool to rule them all so we took very

00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,670
much a

00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:26,910
microservices Architecture approach to

00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:29,040
monitoring and telemetry and we picked

00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:31,470
the pieces that be the most sense for us

00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,100
that we can manage and scale in a

00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:36,960
loosely coupled way and not going to go

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,790
through everything but you know our

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,750
infrastructure and platform type metrics

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:45,660
in flux DB is is the heart of the the

00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:48,870
system of the environment we use

00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:52,620
capacitor to provide some business logic

00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:54,990
as we publish the information that we

00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,700
consume and again that all the

00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:01,020
development teams can also consume as

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:02,390
well and you know one of the things I

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,220
would really want to point out that

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:08,760
builds that trust that partnership is

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,650
you go through the journey and I'm going

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,320
to show you what our dashboards actually

00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:15,840
look like all of the information that we

00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,370
use a hundred percent of the metrics and

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,070
telemetry that we use to manage the

00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,170
platform is completely available to all

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,810
the development teams so there's no

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:27,200
question around how are things running

00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:29,640
my apps not performing right

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,230
what's the platform doing and getting

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,750
that visibility that you might not

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:36,030
otherwise get we completely make that

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,710
open and transparent the feedback we've

00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,080
gotten from the development teams is

00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:43,080
really really positive they really

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,440
appreciate the transparency and when we

00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,630
do have issues on the very rare occasion

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,660
we hold form talk about what went wrong

00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,400
we can show the metrics then we can also

00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,330
talk about what we're going to do to

00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,460
prevent future

00:26:54,330 --> 00:27:03,149
occurences so they really appreciate

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:04,710
that openness and transparency so we

00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:06,539
have three examples we're going to show

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,230
and we'll go through it fairly quickly

00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:13,019
so we can get to some of the Q&A so this

00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,820
is an example of our platform metrics so

00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,679
these are on TVs and on people's screens

00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,179
and so forth and of course any of the

00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,090
development teams that like to keep an

00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,860
eye on us this is an example of our

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,750
metrics and telemetry that we use to

00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,580
show the health and status of what's

00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,580
going on in our platform environment

00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:34,590
monitoring time 'try for applications

00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:36,179
right so we talked about the open source

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:39,149
tools that are available for you to

00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,070
download today and this is what we

00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:43,500
provide automatically for application

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,510
teams and it's just a sample and then of

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,350
course application teams can make

00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:51,659
changes and add elements that are

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,919
important to them but again this happens

00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,690
within moments of birth of the

00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:59,669
application without any user

00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:01,380
intervention at all and then this

00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:04,470
provides the infrastructure kind of

00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,120
underlying do we have enough scale to

00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,919
support the environments to support the

00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,809
demand we don't want the development

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,600
teams to worry about whether or not we

00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:14,700
have enough capacity to support what it

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,679
is that you're trying to innovate so we

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,960
keep an eye on these type of metrics to

00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,720
make sure that our platform has enough

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,570
horsepower to perform and again this is

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,380
for internal and external as well but

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,389
you know we always want to make sure

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:32,700
that we have enough scale to support the

00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:34,919
environment a few of the big lessons

00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,279
learned we've stepped on a lot of

00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,870
landmines for sure but this is

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,510
representative of kind of the best

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,970
advice that we can give and we talk to a

00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:47,880
lot of companies and this is usually

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:49,500
encapsulate so what we talked about if

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,870
you're an infrastructure team that's

00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,769
working to deliver this I can't

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,789
overstate the shift in focus from

00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:58,769
focusing on the infrastructure to

00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:00,779
delivering platforms and services and

00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:06,419
getting closer to the development teams

00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:07,620
is hugely important you can manage the

00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,210
environment using

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,490
things like puppet and ansible and so

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:14,940
forth but the faster that you learn

00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:18,750
things like Bosch and concours and have

00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,180
see ICD pipelines for how you upgrade

00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,280
and manage your own underlying Cloud

00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,110
Foundry environment the sooner that

00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,270
you're going to lay make life a lot

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:31,200
easier for yourself so definitely that's

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:33,120
a big piece of advice because you know

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,070
some things like Bosch are not the

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,059
easiest thing to pick up there's a

00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:40,530
little bit of a learning curve but

00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:44,760
sooner you do it the easier your life

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:50,340
will become the emphasis on partnership

00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:52,559
and community again just huge you saw a

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,410
development teams up on stage you know

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,800
we're really one team we don't really

00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:00,929
look at it in terms of organizational

00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,610
boundaries so we're all in it together

00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:04,500
you definitely want to establish that

00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:08,040
sense of community and partnership with

00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:11,730
the development teams and then simply

00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,260
stated if you make it easy you do not

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,809
have to worry about adoption

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,270
so that insane level of growth zero

00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:19,920
outbound marketing from us it's really

00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:24,179
just all the development teams talking

00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:26,370
telling a friend and so forth and being

00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:29,460
able to deliver value with much less

00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:31,200
effort and that's what enabled our

00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,809
environment to scale there was no

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,850
mandate thou shalt must nots

00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:37,590
it all just happened organically and

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:39,540
again because we provided a safe

00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,340
environment for the development teams to

00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,950
learn and grow and adopt these new

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,730
methodologies so that's a big piece of

00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,730
advice as well

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,159
so just to wrap things up because I do

00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:55,679
think that it's invaluable to talk to

00:30:53,159 --> 00:31:00,679
the folks that are doing off work

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:05,129
get some questions going start together

00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,659
bring friends no one wants to go it

00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:10,830
alone so you really want to start this

00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:14,220
together there's comfort in numbers we

00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:17,940
focused a lot on people the technology

00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:21,409
change can be complex but once you get

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,070
everybody committed and on board and

00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:25,919
comfortable that you're in it together

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:28,019
and channel people's passions then it's

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,679
a lot easier to make all the technology

00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:34,200
changes that you need to make start

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,470
small don't try to solve world hunger

00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,139
just feed the family first be strategic

00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,970
about the applications that you start to

00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:44,629
migrate first so you can capture the

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:50,190
wins and communicate the business value

00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:51,779
as you establish an open forum and a

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,570
feedback loop make sure that you're

00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:57,330
actually listening to customers so all

00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:00,269
the things that we deliver is based

00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:02,250
directly on the customer feedback so

00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:04,110
they feel that right so you want to make

00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:07,950
sure that you definitely listen to your

00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:11,100
customers having a solid foundations

00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:13,230
fairly intuitive automate everything so

00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,090
we're able to support this environment

00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,639
because of just completely ruthless

00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:20,580
levels of automation automation is in

00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,470
our DNA there's not anything that we do

00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,000
that we don't look for ways to automate

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:27,149
that so we don't have to do it again

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,809
manually and that enables us to really

00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:32,039
spend all the amount of time that we do

00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:36,059
collaborating with the product teams and

00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:39,059
the development organization and then

00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:42,000
lastly but most importantly join the

00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:44,389
community you're all here as part of the

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,429
Cloud Foundry foundation community and

00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:50,100
give back give back and sharing the

00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:53,549
lessons that you've learned we learn a

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,500
ton from you all as well so if you've

00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:57,779
created capabilities in your environment

00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,340
please contribute those back to the

00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:03,080
community we're seeing a lot of growth

00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:05,720
contributions for Cloud Foundry which is

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:09,650
awesome to see I'd love to see that

00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,900
it'll happen even faster and even just

00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,580
sharing the stories so we're we're here

00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,860
to share with you but we're also here to

00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,470
listen and learn from you all as well so

00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,150
you know it really do mean it when I say

00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,650
that you know we're anxious to get

00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:25,070
feedback we're anxious to have

00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:28,880
conversations we're going to leave time

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:30,830
for Q&A now and but you know it's not a

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,420
one-and-done so we're you know we're

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,210
here for the rest of the conference and

00:33:32,420 --> 00:34:14,990
really excited to talk to you all

00:33:35,210 --> 00:34:17,150
thank you very much yeah that's a that's

00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:25,040
a great question certainly appreciate

00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:28,460
the the challenge so the the question

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,020
was was around how awesome has our

00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,470
platform and the work that we've done

00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,880
improve the customer experience and you

00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,880
know I think that I shared some of the

00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,800
metrics with you right so we know that

00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:42,800
when our products are working people

00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,380
love our products ok we don't want to be

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,179
Netflix we've we've communicated that

00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,520
you know we have a premium product and

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:53,390
we you know our customers expect a

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,179
premium experience and folks interact

00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:58,190
with our product more so than most any

00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:00,410
other products I can think of right so

00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,030
just the always-on internet and Wi-Fi

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,870
and all of the other products and

00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:09,320
services that we have so we know that

00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:12,050
when we can create an experience that is

00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,369
a self-healing when problems can correct

00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,249
themselves because

00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:18,170
our ability to scale up and scale down

00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:20,359
applications responding to business

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,999
demands in real time that's a way that

00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:27,019
we've enabled our applications to

00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:28,910
support our customers so that 81%

00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:32,210
reduction the amount of time that we're

00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:36,130
impacting folks ability to call and get

00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:38,240
service or to activate new products that

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,910
definitely helps improve the customer

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,769
experience we've shown pretty

00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:45,529
significant gains and again we have a

00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:48,109
lot of work to do for sure but in our

00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:50,990
Net Promoter scores in terms of customer

00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:55,039
satisfaction we've seen really big

00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:56,839
strides and improvement and I can't

00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,059
share necessarily a direct correlation

00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,130
between you know Net Promoter Score the

00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:03,529
customer satisfaction and some of these

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,529
metrics but we do know that when our

00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:09,259
products and services are more available

00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:12,710
then customers don't have to call in and

00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:14,359
the products just work so creating that

00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,690
experience where things are more

00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:19,759
self-healing and more self-service

00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:22,609
I don't know Chris if you want to talk

00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:26,739
about some of the digital first type

00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:26,739
initiatives you want to come on up

00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,219
yeah so for that one in particular

00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:44,839
actually there's a metric that we've

00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:48,349
been tracking for a while that we refer

00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:50,420
to as customer dissatisfaction and a

00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:53,630
couple years ago we started correlating

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,940
that to a line graph also showing the

00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:59,329
availability or what was at the time the

00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,400
lack thereof of our systems and there

00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:03,380
was I forget what the correlation number

00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,599
was but it was so incredibly closely

00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,969
correlated that the business was really

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,269
pressing on us around that's really the

00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:13,339
impetus to improve so not surprisingly

00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:15,219
after implementation in the platform and

00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:17,959
all the journey that Greg just described

00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:20,630
our customer dissatisfaction line has

00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:23,959
gone and gone down in correlation to the

00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,819
uptime of our environments the next leg

00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:28,549
of the journey as Greg just alluded to

00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:31,489
is certainly around digital first that's

00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:33,349
where we want to provide mechanism for

00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:36,819
our customers to interact with us first

00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:39,529
through their smartphone or Xfinity calm

00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:42,170
without having to pick up the phone and

00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:44,539
call a person or more likely pick up the

00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:46,369
phone and go through the IVR and we

00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:50,420
don't hold for a while and then get the

00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:52,459
person so not unlike some of the web

00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,130
scale companies like Netflix and Amazon

00:37:52,459 --> 00:38:02,089
we really want that to be the first way

00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:05,130
that customers can engage with us we had

00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:08,970
to start the Q&A that's cool

00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:31,100
hey we are open right so go is a great

00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:31,100
question thank you thanks one traffic

00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:40,890
yeah so so let me so let me just repeat

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,260
the question and tell me if I got it

00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:45,300
right so the question was we talked

00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,180
about three we chose three services

00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:52,440
where our strategic selection process

00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:54,030
and was that based on traffic and the

00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,560
answer is is that you know certainly

00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,970
there was a lot of traffic these were

00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,280
the services that were called most

00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,230
frequently and there was also another

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,540
dimension which was in terms of the

00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:06,860
resiliency they were also the the

00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:11,790
critical pieces of the services platform

00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:13,440
that were most likely to cause other you

00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:16,710
know kind of near neighbor type of

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,260
issues as well so the the three services

00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:22,110
that we chose was not just based on

00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:25,260
traffic but also the potential impact

00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:27,240
for improving our customer experience so

00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,740
and again that was a testament to Chris

00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,380
and the development team in terms of

00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:34,320
choosing and being really ambitious with

00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,950
respect to the services we chose that's

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,950
a good question

00:39:41,140 --> 00:40:09,230
anything else that is an awesome

00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,330
question and I'm just going to be kind

00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,850
of shameless and I want to give an

00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:19,130
opportunity to some of the folks to come

00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:24,190
one off so yes all right so that the

00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,190
question was and I can flip back to it

00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,080
so the question was around our

00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:33,350
monitoring and telemetry strategy there

00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:35,060
was a lot of pieces up there and we do

00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,860
get a lot of questions about this so the

00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:39,440
question was you know can we provide

00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,420
more granular detail into how we

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,730
selected the pieces and what the

00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:45,410
benefits are and I wanted to you know

00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,570
bring up the folks that actually were

00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:51,710
responsible for it sure Thanks

00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:58,100
so so my name is Tim and this is Sergey

00:40:51,710 --> 00:41:00,110
so sir wait yeah they should have wore

00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,780
like thing one two three four thing one

00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:07,160
two three four yeah so I don't know he's

00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:09,440
number one so the so the strategy kind

00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,630
of built organically and one of the

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,640
things that we really wanted to depict

00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:16,640
with this picture is that what Greg

00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,170
alluded to was that we chose the best

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,240
tool for the bet for the job and

00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:24,110
decomposed our monitoring strategy into

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,940
things in flux DB is a really great time

00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:28,190
series metrics database it's very fast

00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,950
and reliable capacitor does a really

00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,510
good job at massaging those numbers and

00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:35,030
being able to do some business logic on

00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,620
it grrr fana

00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:39,920
you know that is it is it great

00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,630
obviously as it is a great trending tool

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,760
to be able to visualize some of these

00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:49,040
metrics and you know we we just we just

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:53,140
over time came up with this strategy and

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,140
I don't know if there's really any

00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,780
overall thing that we can say to say

00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:59,339
this is the best it's just that you know

00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,890
look at what works for you and just

00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:04,170
employ that for that specific job don't

00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,240
look for something that's gonna do

00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,630
everything for you at once actually you

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,420
know I forgot right because I'm getting

00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,099
old and my memory is failing but so Jim

00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,869
you want to talk about the Bosch config

00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,880
box it's kind of like a little box down

00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:20,460
there and it's not open source yet but

00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,289
again in the spirit of giving back yeah

00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,849
I mean that was one of the challenges we

00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,680
had was that you know the platform's

00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:27,089
always changing right so so when you're

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,650
deploying new VMs when you're scaling

00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:30,480
you're always gonna have new things you

00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,990
need to monitor so we have a method by

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,309
which we can take a Bosch config and

00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:37,890
translate that into an OGG use config

00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:39,930
and we use Nagios because it's simple

00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:42,359
it's extensible and and everything else

00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,549
and it does a pretty good job so we were

00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:47,780
able to to build a script that will

00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:52,890
generate a Nagios config based off of

00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:54,150
Bosh Bosh output or the Boshy API yeah

00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:55,559
so that means that we don't have to

00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,839
worry about forgetting oops

00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:00,119
you know this component or the IP change

00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:02,190
or whatever the case might be it allows

00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,770
us again to just spend more time with

00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:06,569
our development friends than you know

00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,829
worrying about managing the platform but

00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:10,829
again that's something that we're going

00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:14,880
to work on contributing back and again

00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:17,130
you know when you're here I think that

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,660
you know folks might benefit from from

00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,660
that yeah

00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:35,240
it is it is both and so this this topic

00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:39,200
actually might need a separate session

00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,830
it's a pretty big but I'll address these

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,650
questions

00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:44,600
so from selection and strategy

00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:48,380
perspective what strategy do we have to

00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:53,000
select this component well one of the

00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:56,510
strategy is we don't want to commit for

00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,120
twenty years from now we want to build

00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:01,370
system not based on a know some one

00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,370
single enterprise solution that is not

00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:07,130
replaceable but instead pick up pieces

00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:11,530
that can be replaced when there will be

00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:15,380
a new product that will feel better so

00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:18,550
work on work on standards industry

00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:21,680
standards or or you know the standards

00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:26,150
don't try to do too much proprietary

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:28,970
things select components that are play

00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:32,150
well with other vendors other products

00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:35,090
and make sure that you can you can

00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:37,010
easily pick up remove one component and

00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:38,630
replace it with something new

00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:42,590
technologies that will be available next

00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:47,930
year so that is that is on an S on a

00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:54,290
strategy question about about monitoring

00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:58,880
platform or and applications we do balls

00:44:54,290 --> 00:45:01,790
and Greg mentioned Telegraph built back

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,370
so this is one of the things that we we

00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:08,420
started to use very actively to monitor

00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:10,220
the platform but also a lot once once we

00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:14,420
start to advertise and release it to

00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:16,190
show to to our consumers in Comcast many

00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,320
teams started to use it right away

00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:21,890
so what does this built package is doing

00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:25,130
you just create a telegraph dot-com

00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:26,600
configuration and you do CF push this

00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:30,380
configuration that's if you don't need

00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:33,140
anything else and it will automatically

00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:37,430
spin out Telegraph instance based on

00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:38,700
this configuration you can bind influx

00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:41,190
database

00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,470
- this this application and it will

00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:48,510
start to stream your biometrics to that

00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:51,600
application so our consumers application

00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:53,850
teams develops teams are very active and

00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,330
love this feature so they're using this

00:45:53,850 --> 00:46:00,090
for application monitoring as well again

00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:01,980
you know we're here all week as well I

00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,380
want to make sure that we answer any

00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,810
other questions I think we might be at

00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:11,550
time kind of looking at Bridget to see

00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:13,290
but yeah Sergei is obviously you know

00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,360
very knowledgeable and proud of the

00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:17,790
contributions we made certainly you can

00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,590
look at the source code if you have any

00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:25,020
other we have any other questions that

00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:27,810
we can we can answer quickly or we okay

00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,730
so I'm sorry we are at time but what

00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:31,680
we'll do is we'll come down and we'll

00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:34,380
come and talk to you and talk outside so

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:39,020
that we can get the room give the room

00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,020
back all right thanks a lot

00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,789
