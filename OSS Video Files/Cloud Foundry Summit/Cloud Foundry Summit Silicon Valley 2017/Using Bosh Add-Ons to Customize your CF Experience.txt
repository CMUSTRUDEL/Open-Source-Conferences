Title: Using Bosh Add-Ons to Customize your CF Experience
Publication date: 2017-06-21
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Silicon Valley 2017
Description: 
	Using Bosh Add-Ons to Customize your CF Experience [I] - Bridget Arthur & Josh Ghiloni, ECS Team    

Bosh add-ons are a new feature that allows teams to customize the virtual machines in their bosh deployment. Although this was previously accomplished through complex post-deploy orchestrations or fragile stemcell modifications, the bosh add-on is a simple, flexible mechanism that plugs directly into any existing bosh 2.0 manifest.

Often times operators discover that the standard VM does not contain some of the VM-level monitoring tools commonly used in troubleshooting. Using this situation as a working example, attendees will learn:
- The use cases for bosh add-ons
- The details and mechanics of how add-ons work
- How to create a bosh add-on
- How to integrate it with an existing bosh deployment

all right hi everybody welcome to CF

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,139
summit 2017 we're gonna talk about pouch

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,450
add-ons today they're pretty awesome you

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,660
can be awesome too you can do anything

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,779
if you try hard and believe in yourself

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:21,390
and I think this is gonna be pretty

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,630
interesting for you guys but let's talk

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,390
about who we are first so this is Josh

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,500
he's my esteemed colleague at ECS team

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,130
not part of CGI

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,380
he graduated from Case Western Reserve

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:42,210
University peer science degree go

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:50,219
Spartans sure he's now a certified Cloud

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:58,770
Foundry developer I did get a cool

00:00:50,219 --> 00:01:00,600
sweatshirt today he's a CGI and has he's

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,910
one of our probably best architects he's

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,460
a bit of a bunch of projects doing cloud

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,720
native development platform installs

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,119
he's kind of the go-to guy for

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,740
everything and actually a really cool

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,840
guy to hang out with I don't understand

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,760
most of his Simpsons and Star Trek

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,130
references but I just kind of nod a

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,799
smile and besides that it's pretty cool

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,479
and this is Bridget Archer she is like

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,950
she said my colleague at CGI she's one

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,470
of our senior cloud architects as well

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,920
she graduated from Regis University in

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:33,479
Denver go read his mascot Rangers go

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,310
Rangers all right she has been doing CF

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,170
a little bit less than I have started in

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,509
2015 ish but she is an excellent

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,979
developer and architect and we are happy

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:49,890
to have her on every project we have her

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:53,640
on and so are our clients so let's get

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,649
started with the actual contents so

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,820
Bosch I'm sure many of you here have

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,649
used Bosch

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,439
it's kind of an abstraction layer to

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,670
manage all your VMs so you know when you

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,030
have a cloud foundry install you're

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,469
gonna have 37 some VMs Bosch is gonna

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,330
manage all that for you so it's gonna

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,760
handle the deployment of it it's gonna

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,940
handle upgrades to your platform upgrade

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,180
to the VMS

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,300
um it's all done through yellow files

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,460
you have always this configuration files

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,870
to manage getting your VMs deployed you

00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,930
need to upgrade you just modify the file

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,550
do a bas deployment it's kind of it

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,390
works it's cloud agnostic so it's going

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,100
to work across all the different

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,530
platforms so no matter what you're on

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:37,240
you can use Bosh and it will get

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:39,910
everything working for you so how many

00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,210
of you were at the Bosh class yesterday

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,410
the DC has provided excellent so you

00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,240
guys learned in those of you that know

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,760
Bosh know that Bosh has stem cells

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,620
releases and deployments what if you

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,260
have a release that you want to use but

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,790
it's maybe it's not quite sufficient

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,050
what are you gonna do or a stem cell

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,920
doesn't have what you need

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,450
I mean you could modify the stem cell or

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,190
the deployment but maybe you don't run

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:08,070
that deployment so now you're

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:12,220
maintaining a fork and that's bad

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:14,920
because what if there are sea bees that

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,450
come in what if you find what if

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,170
upstream bugs are found now you have to

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:24,850
merge it and all that stuff you could

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:28,630
just manually add it to the VM but VMs

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:30,220
die VMs are cattle in Boston Cloud

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,260
Foundry roll they're meant to die

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,590
they're meant to be recreated so

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,440
anything that you do to that VM could be

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,400
gone in ten minutes

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,989
depends on some people's security

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,800
requirements it may intentionally be

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,370
gone in ten minutes

00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:51,550
and intentionally recreated some people

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:58,630
don't get that that's also bad so let's

00:03:51,550 --> 00:04:02,230
move on so add ons they are global to

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:05,560
your Bosch director any deployments that

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:09,100
you have can have a set of add-ons that

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,580
you specify they are still yeah Mille

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,530
sorry it's a lotta ammo you create a

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,150
one-time config file how many of you

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:21,640
have used Bosch to the cloud config same

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:26,090
basic concept you create an identity

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:29,270
file so if you get the runtime can

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,850
big if you want to modify it you need to

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,010
get what you have first then modify it

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,900
then put it back because if you just

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,699
make a new one it's not additive it will

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,680
erase what you have up there already

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:46,100
then you redeploy and you can do filters

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,790
you can say I only want to apply this

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,880
add-on to VMs that have for example a

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:55,790
Postgres job or that are running nginx

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,830
or that are running on a specific stem

00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:02,150
cells so you can have just this Ubuntu

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:03,710
one or just Windows you can also do the

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,530
exact same thing in the opposite

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,590
direction and exclude very simple things

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,030
and that's very new I believe that is in

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,310
version 260 a Bosch and I think we're on

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:20,330
262 right now so the excludes are very

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:22,880
very new so what are the kind of the

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,430
common add-ons are gonna want to do for

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,199
a Bosch add-on if you want to put like

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,479
antivirus software if you want but

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,610
monitoring software across all your VMs

00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:34,340
or all your Linux boxes you can go ahead

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,220
and do that some of our common ones per

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,840
security IPSec you wanted that to be

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,460
applied across everything you just

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,340
create the Bosch add-on and deploy it

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,260
across your VMs if you need if you have

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,360
an automated user that needs to have

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,030
access to a bunch of the apps you can

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,910
set up SSH access for that one user to

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,720
get into all your VMs so actually that's

00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,270
one of the ones we're going to show

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,860
today certain compliance requirements

00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,510
you know maybe you need to have an SSH

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,460
banner every time if someone logs into

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,289
your machine you know set that up in the

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,300
yellow configuration file and deploy it

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:08,150
and it'll be on all your VMs other

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,820
common stuff like networking all done

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,130
through the Box really anything you can

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,289
do through the Linux kernel anything

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,760
that you could do as a box job which

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:24,080
we're gonna see you can do as an add-on

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:26,470
because it's demo time and let's pull up

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,470
our

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:35,130
let's make this nice and big and we have

00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,110
a little Amazon concourse deployments

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,200
stood up because we don't have time to

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,940
deploy add-ons to 30 some-odd VMs so

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,700
we've got a little concourse deployment

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,850
with 3 VMs but let's go look at our

00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:55,170
runtime compile our runtime it config

00:06:47,850 --> 00:07:01,380
file excuse me and you can see you say

00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:06,950
here or the releases I want to do here

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:09,180
is each add-on it's a job we can specify

00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,490
exclude rule or include rules we're

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,970
doing include rules here so for example

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:18,780
we're gonna add this web user to a file

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,100
or to a VM that is running the ATC

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,010
concourse job which is their web

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,290
front-end same thing we're gonna add a

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,660
different user to the DB server and

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:34,890
we're gonna add a third user to the

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:38,250
workers so let's go ahead and log in we

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:43,740
are using the new version of the Bosch

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:45,300
CLI and I just realized that I don't

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,560
think we uploaded that os comp release

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,560
so let's do that real quick

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,509
let's do this

00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,990
goodness I am too tall for this

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:45,210
okay so we have the release there now we

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:47,370
need to upload this runtime config one

00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,810
thing you'll notice between the v1 how

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,950
many of you have used the v2 version of

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:58,800
the Box CLI have your your - keys been

00:08:52,950 --> 00:09:02,730
getting a workout hasn't it to use data

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:09,120
do spaces instead of dashes oh learn

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:10,080
something new every day yes that is

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,740
exactly what I meant

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:19,230
thank you okay

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,600
we have now uploaded this runtime can

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:25,500
think we've updated it our deployments

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,630
are now out of sync just like if you

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,020
updated your cloud config so now we need

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,020
to redeploy

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:44,060
right Dashie

00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:45,470
it's everything yep okay as you can see

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,810
this is all the stuff from our add-on

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,070
config so we're gonna head and go ahead

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:53,839
and deploy this only takes a minute or

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:55,790
two because we only have three VMs and

00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,680
you'll see after the fact that we'll be

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:02,300
able to go ahead and ssh to these we'll

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,900
be able to go ahead and ssh to these VMs

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:13,660
without using Balch ssh we'll be able to

00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:17,410
use just the standard ssh command and

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,610
you'll see that here and you'll see that

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,890
because we had those include rules on

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,190
the ssh keys that we'll be able to log

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:34,150
into one vm with one key but not the

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:37,490
others no that should be on everything

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:41,570
yes this is not the first time we've

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:43,779
done it but you know the demo gods are

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,779
fickle

00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:53,269
and I'm really glad that Amazon's not

00:10:48,589 --> 00:11:00,619
having an outage today alright so let's

00:10:53,269 --> 00:11:09,319
try SSH oh we should get the IP

00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:18,519
addresses on the VMS first okay

00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:18,519
I created a private key for each one

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,410
there you go

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:34,810
you see our banner we were able to log

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:38,320
directly in and these ssh users have c

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,480
to access this is great if you need to

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,300
be able to install for example a

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:49,330
compliance agent Nessus if you're doing

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:53,140
pci scanning that sort of thing so but

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:56,920
now let's try logging in to the st. with

00:11:53,140 --> 00:12:00,339
the same key to a different VM and

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:05,440
you'll see that you get the banner but

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:07,330
you weren't allowed in so that was our

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,210
short demo and now I'm going to take us

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:13,750
back to my favorite slide that I've ever

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,140
done I don't at all

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:20,920
anybody that can get it anybody that

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:25,089
knows what this slide means yeah was it

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,830
was it mean queue and eggs stopped by DZ

00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:29,110
has booth if you knew this and get a

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,650
shirt or if you didn't know get a shirt

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:38,920
we have a ton shirts so now we have time

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:40,120
for some Q&A anybody has a queue or well

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,570
if you have a queue we have an a

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,570
hopefully

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,260
so I was hoping I saw that enable ipv6

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,529
add-on do you mind talking a little bit

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,360
about what that does sure so that one in

00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:08,639
particular you can actually see an

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,060
example of it on Bosch do it is one of

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:16,160
the example ones they give it basically

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:19,889
sets a kernel parameter in at CSIS CTL

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,779
so that's basically yet yep you don't

00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:25,470
mind just mention your name and

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:32,220
Association that helps to get sure my

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:34,440
name is Tim I work with Comcast hi my

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,589
name is Nick Moreno I work at Alton

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:41,070
software sass provider of HR software

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:42,720
we're actually using PCF so obviously it

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,370
abstracts a lot of the the Boche stuff

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,690
with you and one of the reasons I

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,920
mentioned Bosh Bosh add-ons is to find

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,269
ways to tweak some of the stuff that we

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,920
don't inherently get from you know

00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:55,320
anybody who uses a PCF from like Ops man

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,959
and things like that so I'm kind of

00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,579
curious if you have any experience using

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,079
PCF what do you guys use cloud found you

00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:03,480
directly and if you do have experience

00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,949
PCF like how or like what's the use case

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,130
for or how do you go about the process

00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:11,250
of adding about Bosh add-ons so do that

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:15,269
sure so we do use PCF and Bosh add-ons

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:17,069
together it's about the same you you run

00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:20,490
through the same commands obviously the

00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:23,100
v1 version of the command line you can

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,750
log into the ops manager director you

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,250
update your runtime config and then you

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,750
just hit apply changes instead of Bosh

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,860
deploy gotcha yes but yeah and that's

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,060
what I was thinking within the same

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,949
thing you said that you needed to get

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,810
the way the deployment looks like the

00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:38,730
deploy manifest masses then make

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,920
modifications to it and then kind of do

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,180
it again so there is some and what do

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,250
you usually like the ops manager API to

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,769
make you so if you if you're on the ops

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,480
major you can SSH to the ops manager VM

00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,740
and then you have access to the Bosh

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,380
command line and you can do it exactly

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,769
there gotcha yep so that's what I would

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,740
do

00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:57,480
oh and one thing we wanted to bring up

00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:01,439
was and this is not very well documented

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,970
is how to delete an add-on you take

00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:06,569
advantage of the fact that this runtime

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,199
config is idempotent so Creator runtime

00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:08,670
can

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,670
without the add-on that you wanted to

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,589
leave me do a redeploy but then you

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,360
actually need to go and Bausch recreate

00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:18,269
the VMS in question that you want to

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,740
clean up because the the act of

00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:23,249
redeploying without the add-ons in the

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,129
list will not recreate them so doing a

00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:28,670
Bosch recreate will create a clean copy

00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:35,819
of the VM without those add-on jobs

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:38,490
thank you anybody else okay I got a

00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:44,850
couple here I have a question too but

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:46,829
I'll defer until hey my name is Bruce

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,649
stringer from Rackspace we've been doing

00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:51,389
some manage services for PCF I had a

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:53,790
question around so you guys using OS

00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,709
come for lease are there any other like

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,119
cool ones out there that you think are

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:03,439
worth mentioning that we should check

00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:08,670
out um there is an IPSec release that is

00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:10,290
has been targeted for PCF there are

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,699
documents around using it PCF there are

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,490
also documents around using into open

00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:16,499
source they're very similar but another

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,230
one that we've seen a lot at ETS team

00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:21,470
CGI is using Prometheus for monitoring

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:26,339
and that's accomplished through that on

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:27,959
so cool thanks mm-hmm any other

00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,540
questioning there was one over here yeah

00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:37,740
all right let me run there it's a good

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:40,589
workout okay yeah we got a lot of time

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:45,120
we have like 13 minutes left so feel

00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:48,300
free Christian from all Taurus and my

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,720
question is so if you want to install

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,149
external changes from different packages

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,370
you you can create a release or you have

00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:59,120
to find a release you absolutely can't

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,990
create a release we have done that

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,709
sometimes you have to be careful I will

00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,569
say this just as a good suggestion

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:10,949
don't do anything that messes with IP

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:12,209
tables on the VMS trust me come to the

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:16,439
ECS booth later and ask me how I know

00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:18,770
this that's what guy other questions

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,770
okay

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,009
Oh

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:28,179
yeah I'm bill being with John Deere so

00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:30,370
we use concourse for deploying our Cloud

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:32,860
Foundry and one of the nice things about

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,809
that is like when you when you do a

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,090
Bosch deployment there's like only three

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,620
inputs right a stem so a deployment and

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,330
one other thing I can't remember because

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,149
I'm talking in front of people release

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:47,169
but now there's now there's like two

00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:49,960
other things like this cloud config and

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:52,480
these add-ons is there any thought about

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,850
how those could kind of be managed out

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,629
of band and like a pipeline sort of way

00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,490
sure so I mean you can if you I mean you

00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:02,019
can run those completely separate from

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,779
the other things because they are global

00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:06,309
to the director stop by the Express

00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:11,019
Scripts booth later and they can tell

00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:15,039
you how they've done it and I will say

00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:17,919
305 today are the Bosch office hours in

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,600
the collaboration area in the foundry so

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,299
definitely stop by there talk to Dmitry

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,009
talk to the rest of the team and they

00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:26,409
will have lots of great answers for you

00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:29,139
but yes I done pipelines

00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:40,690
that handle those out-of-band from the

00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:45,509
other upgrade processes I think you said

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:49,389
you had a question my question was I

00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:50,830
know at IBM in bluemix when I introduced

00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:52,779
this concept to them they were so so

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,549
super cool just like you guys excited

00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:57,129
and they started adding a bunch of

00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:59,500
add-ons and of course we hit a wood

00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:01,389
block which was that there was one

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,419
particular component they wanted to add

00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:06,549
that actually modified not necessary to

00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:07,840
Colonel but loaded a kernel module so

00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:09,279
there is limits to what you can do it

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,110
out on can you talk a little bit about

00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:16,059
that in terms of like what shouldn't you

00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:17,769
do to add-ons excuse me um you know

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:20,320
that's interesting we it not we have not

00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:25,299
done them in depth enough yet to get to

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:30,899
these limitations that seems like a good

00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:32,250
one if you have to add kernel modules so

00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:35,039
you know I think that might actually

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,669
that's a little out of our range but

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,690
that's that's a really interesting

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:43,860
statement that you've gotten to that

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,899
point where you've had sure so your

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,120
recreate the reboot the vm after you do

00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:49,890
it exactly exactly and I and I think you

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,019
mentioned if you have something that

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,000
you're adding that's modifying some core

00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:54,690
component like you know it's many

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,370
iptables

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,590
then you've got to be careful about that

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,380
because it'll prevent you cascading

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,330
dependencies and failures after I think

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:08,700
I had someone behind you there okay cool

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:11,070
yeah maybe that triggers mark mark from

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,380
pivotal I just like to say we're

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,809
speaking about using blush add-ons

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,149
tomorrow around 4:10 using blush add-ons

00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:20,220
to become PCI compliant how that can

00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:22,110
help you and we have three add-ons that

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,690
we've developed and it's not that can

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:29,279
talk about some of those constraints

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:32,820
that we found so for 10:00 tomorrow okay

00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:36,570
any other question one last one no okay

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,960
cool so thank you again thank you

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,490
everybody

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:44,529
and Parker
