Description: 
	Using Bosh Add-Ons to Customize your CF Experience [I] - Bridget Arthur & Josh Ghiloni, ECS Team    

Bosh add-ons are a new feature that allows teams to customize the virtual machines in their bosh deployment. Although this was previously accomplished through complex post-deploy orchestrations or fragile stemcell modifications, the bosh add-on is a simple, flexible mechanism that plugs directly into any existing bosh 2.0 manifest.

Often times operators discover that the standard VM does not contain some of the VM-level monitoring tools commonly used in troubleshooting. Using this situation as a working example, attendees will learn:
- The use cases for bosh add-ons
- The details and mechanics of how add-ons work
- How to create a bosh add-on
- How to integrate it with an existing bosh deployment
