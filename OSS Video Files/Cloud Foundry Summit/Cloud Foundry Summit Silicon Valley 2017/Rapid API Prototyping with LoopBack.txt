Erin McKean loves talking about APIs to anyone who will stand still long enough. Before Node.js, she dabbled in Ruby, HyperCard, Perl, and Omnimark, and still finds herself writing bash scripts on a regular basis. Erin is also the founder of Wordnik.com, which has a lot of fun APIs! In her spare time she sews clothes and makes Twitterbots.
