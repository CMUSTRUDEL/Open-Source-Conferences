	Carvel in Action with CF for K8s - Dr. Dave Walter, Vmware

Integrating the myriad of YAML documents that make up the CF for K8s platform is no small task. Fortunately, we have the Carvel suite of tools (formerly known as K14s) in our toolbox. This talk explores the ways in which the CF Release Integration team have made use of vendir, ytt and kapp to pull together a variety of components. Attend this talk and learn how Carvel tools are used to:

* incorporate and extract subdirectories containing K8s templates from other repositories with vendir
* limit the blast radius of ytt overlays by using dynamic library loading
* define custom kapp change and wait rules to provide a better operator deployment experience
