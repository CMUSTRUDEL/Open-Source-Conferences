KubeCF is an extensible Helm release providing a Kubernetes-ready Cloud Foundry distribution now, and a path forwards to next-generation components and features. We'll talk about how to adapt it to add your own stacks, buildpacks and other components, or implement completely new features using Kubernetes and EiriniX.This session also covers what's new in the latest release, including production-ready Eirini, multi-cluster support, and Container-to-Container networking.
