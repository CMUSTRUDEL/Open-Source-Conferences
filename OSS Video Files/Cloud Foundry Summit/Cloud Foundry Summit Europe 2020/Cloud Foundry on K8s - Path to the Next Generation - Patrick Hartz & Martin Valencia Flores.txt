Even now when Kubernetes is becoming more and more popular CF is still a great choice to make micro services available to the outer world. The portability of applications, the easiness of scaling and the dynamic routing are just some benefits. Nowadays VMs are starting to be left behind in favor of containers, and CF is a prime candidate to bring to Kuberntes. For all the reasons mentioned above, and for the user experience that has been gained and built over the years. Progress does not imply starting with a totally clean slate, progress is built upon strong foundations. In this talk we will take you with us on our journey, and tell you why and how we deployed CF on Kubernetes and what challenges came along this road.
