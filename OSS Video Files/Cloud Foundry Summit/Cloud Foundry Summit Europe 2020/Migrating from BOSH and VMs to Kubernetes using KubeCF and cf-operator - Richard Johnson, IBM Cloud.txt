	Migrating from BOSH and VMs to Kubernetes using KubeCF and cf-operator - Richard Johnson, IBM Cloud

This session will explore the challenges and details on how to seamlessly migrate from a BOSH and a Virtual Machine based platform, to Kubernetes, using the KubeCF and cf-operator projects. This includes transitioning extremely large numbers of customer applications in a seamless zero-downtime way. This session will discuss some of the operational comparisons and changes when converting from a BOSH based operational environment to a Kubernetes platform. It will also describe the hybrid approaches that IBM is developing to allow for an incremental migration of some of the world's largest Cloud Foundry environments.

In this session, Richard Johnson, STSM, Site Reliability Engineer Lead, IBM Cloud, walk through the struggles and successes of evolving the underlying infrastructure of the the worlds largest Cloud Foundry installations, with zero user impact or awareness.
