Description: 
	Panel: Cloud Foundry – Opening the Kubernetes Serving Kitchen Again - Bernd Krannich, SAP SE; Dieu Cao, VMware; Simon Moser, IBM; Jeff Hobbs, SUSE; Daniel Jones, EngineerBetter

The re-platforming of Cloud Foundry onto Kubernetes has resulted in many tangible results: There are two distributions of a Kubernetes-based Cloud Foundry with kubecf and cf-for-k8s. There are projects like Cloud Native Buildpacks and kpack that bring benefits from the Cloud Foundry ecosystem to the broader Kubernetes community. In this panel discussion – almost a traditional event at Cloud Foundry Summits – representatives of major companies contributing to the Cloud Foundry ecosystem review the status quo but even more importantly the steps ahead of Cloud Foundry's journey towards Kubernetes from both the perspective of people developing and operating the platform as well as end-users of the platform.
