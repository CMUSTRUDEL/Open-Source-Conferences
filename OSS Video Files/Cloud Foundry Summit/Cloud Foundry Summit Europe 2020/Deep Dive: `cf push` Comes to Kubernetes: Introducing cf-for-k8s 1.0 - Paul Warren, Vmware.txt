	Deep Dive: `cf push` Comes to Kubernetes: Introducing cf-for-k8s 1.0 - Paul Warren, Vmware

Cloud Foundry recently launched the much-awaited Cloud Foundry for Kubernetes (cf-for-k8s) 1.0 release. The cf-for-k8s project is aimed at simplifying the development and deployment of cloud-native apps on Kubernetes. In this talk, we will discuss the challenges app developers face in working with Kubernetes, and provide an introduction to Cloud Foundry and “cf push.” We’ll also explore the benefits of abstraction interfaces for app developers, how it leverages popular projects from the Kubernetes ecosystem, and a walkthrough of how to get started. By the end of this session, attendees will be able to understand the general architecture of cf-for-k8s, the benefits of using cf-for-k8s atop Kubernetes, and the project roadmap.
