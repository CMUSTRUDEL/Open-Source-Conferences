Description: 
	The Diversity Conversation: Making the Invisible Visible: Seeing, Respecting, and Valuing Care and Maintenance in our Code and Beyond - Lauren Bacon, &yet

Introduction by Caitlyn O’Connell, Cloud Foundry Foundation.

This year's COVID-19 pandemic has pulled back the curtain on the role of care work within our individual, social, and collective lives. While many of us in the tech sector have experience working remotely and from home, few of us have done so under such extreme and trying circumstances.

In particular, parents with children living at home have been navigating a new world of remote schooling and loss of childcare in an economy that tends to treat child-rearing and other forms of care work as externalities, rather than as central to our lives. In her talk, Lauren Bacon explores the ways in which care work is and isn’t noticed or valued, especially in the tech sector -- and what each of us can do to make that invisible work more visible, more clearly understood -- and ultimately, more valued.

The Diversity Conversation is dedicated to subjects relating to diversity, equity and inclusivity. It is a session open to all Summit attendees. We invite you to attend this event regardless of your prior experience with these topics. It is our hope that you leave the Diversity Conversation inspired and with a call to action, whether it’s a workshop to take, a conversation to have, a book to read, a practice to implement, or a question to ask.

hi everyone my name is caitlin and i run

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,200
content strategy and diversity

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,319
programming for the cloud foundry

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,680
foundation

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,920
i want to welcome you to the cloud

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,519
foundry summit diversity conversation

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,360
we've changed the name from luncheon

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,040
because it's closer to afternoon tea in

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,560
europe and more like a midnight snack

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,000
here in california

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,000
regardless of what this event is

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,920
officially called it's the nexus of all

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,439
things diversity equity and inclusion

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,880
for the cloud foundry community

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,119
and we're really pleased to have you in

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,039
the audience today

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,720
we all know this year has been unlike

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
any other in our lives

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
in addition to the political upheaval

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,840
faced by many countries around the world

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,320
the coven 19 pandemic

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,399
has upended and in many cases revealed

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,840
deep fissures and the known structures

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,920
of our culture

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
the line between home and workplace has

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,559
blurred for billions of people across

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,160
the globe

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,520
and that is largely for the privileged

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,640
classes who have the option to work

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,320
remotely

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,079
millions of employees have lost their

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,160
jobs as their industries functionally

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,399
disappear during safer at home rules

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,640
while healthcare and frontline workers

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,320
laborers and those deemed essential

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,000
continue to put their own lives on the

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,080
line every time they go to work

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
with people of color immigrants and

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,880
women disproportionately bearing the

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,479
burden

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,400
many of us who work in technology have

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,920
been fortunate enough to keep our jobs

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,920
and pivot to remote work

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
but new challenges arise for employees

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,240
who are responsible not only for

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
themselves

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,960
but for children immunocompromised

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,880
family members and elderly relatives

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,000
with the collapse of in-person education

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,240
and the concerns around

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,439
communal centers for elder care or

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,200
rehabilitation

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
the brunt of caretaking falls to the

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,720
adults who are already pressured to

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,240
maintain a sense of stability for their

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,159
families

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
because caretaking is so often invisible

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
to those not performing it

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,079
it is overlooked and under-appreciated

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,680
in cultures across the globe care work

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,280
is taken for granted by those who are

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,399
not expected to adopt the role of

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,320
caretaker

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
in the united states in particular the

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,640
impact of gendered care work

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
expectations

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,079
has come into the limelight during the

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,680
pandemic as working mothers are pushed

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,000
to leave the workforce in droves

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,079
compared to their male companions

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,159
the bureau of labor statistics reports

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,560
that 865

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,560
000 women left the workforce in the

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,080
month of september alone

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,680
four times that of men

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,840
not only are women in heterosexual

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,040
partnerships more frequently expected to

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,800
care for the children who are now

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,720
learning from home but their jobs are

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
often not compensated at the same rate

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,760
as their male partners due to the

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,520
infamous gender pay gap

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,599
this leaves parents little choice but to

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,360
choose the higher earning partner's job

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,720
forcing the co-parent to abandon her

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,920
career to ensure

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,239
their children are receiving an

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,239
education during the pandemic

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,239
here to talk about care work today is

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,959
lauren bacon a startup co-founder and

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,440
strategist who began coding in 1996

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,959
started her own dev shop in 2000 and

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,959
works now for end yet

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,840
a software and design consultancy that

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,000
works with people first technology

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
organizations

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,440
lauren's writing on business gender

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,040
diversity in the tech industry

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
and well-being at work has been

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,200
published in time courts

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,879
and the atlantic lauren will explore the

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,599
crucial impact of care work in our

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,040
culture

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,040
and the ways in which it dovetails with

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,120
care work in the tech industry and even

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,800
within writing code itself

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,040
in her talk she will highlight how care

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,200
work both personal and professional

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,200
goes under the radar and what we can do

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,319
especially in the tech industry but also

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,440
in our own homes

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,920
to make that invisible labor visible

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
please join me in welcoming lauren bacon

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,760
to the diversity conversation and giving

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,519
a special thank you to steve greenberg

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
at resilient scale for sponsoring this

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,840
community event

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,120
welcome lauren and thank you steve enjoy

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,120
the diversity conversation

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,239
hi i'm lauren bacon thank you so much

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,239
for having me here

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,720
i want to begin by acknowledging that

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
i am recording this on the traditional

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,560
territories

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
of the massachusetts people in the city

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,720
of boston which the massachusetts called

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,840
totant

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,519
it is an interesting thing to be

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,120
doing a land acknowledgement for a

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,519
virtual gathering

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,920
and it may be an unfamiliar practice to

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,400
those of you from europe i'm not sure

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,040
where i am from i'm canadian i live in

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,959
the u.s

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,040
it's a practice that we engage in to

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,879
remember our history

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,320
to share respect and gratitude to

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,320
indigenous peoples

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,519
as well as to remember the work that we

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,800
still have before us

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,840
to disentangle the complex and

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
messy legacies of colonization it's a

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,840
way to

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,720
ask a series of questions that settlers

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,160
are rarely

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,600
forced to ask questions like whose land

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,360
are we on and what historical events

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,560
led to me being here in this moment

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,919
now the massachusetts people lived

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,199
and worked on this land for 17 000

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,680
years prior to european contact

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,360
but if you were to visit the city and

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,080
take a boston history tour

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,840
the odds are that you would only hear

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,199
about colonial history

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,759
by which um the tour guides mean early

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,320
colonization and that that history in

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,360
the 1600s that's the mayflower and all

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,280
of that stuff

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,199
and then the history that boston is best

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,240
known for which is the events

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,039
of the american revolution you will not

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,680
hear much about the indigenous people

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,160
whose land was stolen by these colonists

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,600
but that stolen land made all of the

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,880
rest of that history

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,919
possible now i'm not suggesting that

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,240
colonization

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
and what i'm going to talk about today

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,560
are

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,360
remotely in the same realm but

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,400
one of the recurring themes of this talk

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,240
has to do

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,800
with making the invisible visible

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,320
the land that i'm on the geography of

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,240
the place where i live is

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,800
invisible to you and the land that

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,919
you're on is invisible to me

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,240
but without it we couldn't exist

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,400
so land acknowledgement is one practice

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,319
for making the invisible visible

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,000
we look down and we remember that

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,840
everything we're doing in life we are

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,039
doing with the extremely generous

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,000
support

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,360
of the earth itself we look around and

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,840
we notice that everything

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,919
we have in life we have thanks to a very

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,600
particular set of circumstances

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,639
which includes history genetics fortune

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,680
and so on so we humans

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,600
have cognitive limitations and biases

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,639
that just limit our ability

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,600
to perceive all of those things at once

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,319
um and regularly and so i'm very

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,440
interested

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,199
in practices that help us to remember uh

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,880
land acknowledgement is one such

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,199
practice

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,240
um but you know you may have your own

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,840
practices and

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,680
here's a practice i was raised in i was

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
raised in a household where before every

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
meal

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,680
this is very common place around the

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,080
world we took a moment to express

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,919
gratitude for everyone and everything

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,360
that made the meal possible

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,639
the farmers the soil the

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,560
air the water the sunshine um the people

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,520
at the grocery store

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,720
the family member who cooked if you have

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,919
your own practices

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
that that help you tap into that feeling

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,199
of

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,120
gratitude of noticing all of the

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,919
invisible supports

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,599
that you benefit from and especially

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,039
those that you maybe don't think about

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,800
very often

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,440
maybe you could share them in the chat

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
right now as you're listening to this

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,720
or send them to me on twitter i would

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,840
love to hear them

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,280
okay so this talk was sparked by two

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,319
things first headline

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,199
after headline like these ones

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,319
and countless conversations with other

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,440
parents

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:51,360
who have been utterly overwhelmed

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:55,360
this year those conversations

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,720
included tears a lot of tears

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,080
fear of losing jobs exasperation with

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,440
remote learning

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,879
um a sense of being stretched to the

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
absolute limit

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,120
uh to the breaking point by the comedic

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,840
competing demands on their time

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,720
energy and attention and then also

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,360
noticing how

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,639
gender factored into various families

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,639
choices about how to cope

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,280
and this is the other piece that

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,680
inspired this talk

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,720
from the cloud foundry website a

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
collective vision

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,720
for an ethical people first technology

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,839
community

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,839
and future that resonated with me

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,560
deeply because i'm a parent of two kids

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,440
ages five and eight i'm a woman who's

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,640
worked in tech since 1997.

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,800
much of that time focused on supporting

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,760
organizations that were focused on

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,480
social change

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,080
and collective thriving also the company

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,320
i work for now and yet

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,920
also describes itself and and the

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,040
projects that we work on as

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,720
people first and so i want to talk today

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,160
about what i think that means in this

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,200
particular moment

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,080
in a very particular context in tech in

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,360
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,080
at this inflection point

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,680
so how do we live and work in people

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,519
first ways

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,120
while surviving a pandemic that's

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,440
question number one

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,160
and what are some of the lessons that we

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,279
might take

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,320
out of this incredibly difficult year

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,560
that might help us to build more

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,680
people first tech and a more people

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,680
first future

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,760
okay so like i said earlier i want to

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,320
focus here on

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,040
how we can make the invisible more

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
visible

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,760
and that's because in any conversation

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,800
about diversity and inclusion

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,680
and putting people first we are asking

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,760
questions about

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
whose voices and perspectives are

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,120
foregrounded

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,720
and whose are not being seen or

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,800
prioritized

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,399
often when we look at diversity we focus

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,839
on aspects of identity

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,320
and lived experience race gender

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,000
sexual orientation neurodivergence

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,079
disability and so on

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,320
but with every group within every group

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,560
there will be other facets of diversity

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,040
to consider that are specific

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,399
to your context so my friend tara

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,200
robertson who until

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,399
recently led mozilla's global diversity

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
and inclusion team

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,480
has a great slide in one of her talks

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,279
that i'll link to later that outlines

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,640
27 different facets of diversity among

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,640
mozillians

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,560
including some that don't always get

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,399
mentioned when we talk about diversity

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,079
writ large but that might be familiar to

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,040
you like

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,240
technical versus non-technical volunteer

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,440
and employee

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,120
time zones uh role and level so i won't

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,040
go through the whole list here but i

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,839
would invite you to reflect on

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,279
these and other aspects of diversity and

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,640
how they might show up in the cloud

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,040
foundry community

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,079
and then ask yourself these questions

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,480
which i also got from

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,519
tara whose voices are centered by

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,839
default

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,560
and who's are less visible or prominent

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,680
so today i want to focus on three axes

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,800
of diversity

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,160
work roles family status especially

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,839
as it relates to care work

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,920
responsibilities

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,760
and gender and i want to put all of

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,640
these in the context of both

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,600
this year's pandemic and the tech sector

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,519
writ large

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,240
i'm deliberately putting gender third

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,560
here because while i'm going to share

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
some data about men and women and

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,880
actually a brief

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,560
sidebar here um i don't believe that

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,640
gender is binary

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,959
but i'm limited to some extent by the

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,839
way that social scientists and

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,040
journalists

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,079
tend to use binary gender

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,519
in their research and reporting so i

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,079
apologize in advance

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,760
for that limitation and that simplistic

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,040
vocabulary

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:02,079
as well as the extremely heterocentric

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,760
uh lens that appears almost

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,480
everywhere on child rearing data so

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,600
okay that's my sidebar so as i was

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,320
saying i'm going to share

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,399
some data about men and women and how

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,560
care work is expected and assigned

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,639
differently by gender

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,760
but i really want us to think beyond

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,760
whatever our own

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,120
gender identity is and ask some big

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,600
questions about

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,240
how we all value care and maintenance

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,240
work

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,600
and how that work benefits us all

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,720
so what is care work and why is it

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,639
so often invisible let's start by

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,600
defining care work and then we'll talk a

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,279
little bit about

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,160
the invisibility piece this is going to

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,560
loop back around to pandemic parenting

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,760
and to the tech context but i think it's

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,120
important to first

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,279
define our terms so care work is a term

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,519
that's used in different contexts

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,519
to mean slightly different things but

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
here's one definition that has been

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,440
widely

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,160
cited care work includes

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,120
everything we do to maintain contribute

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,839
and repair

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,600
our world so that we can live in it as

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,959
well as possible

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,040
that work includes our bodies ourselves

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,720
and our environments all of which we

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,760
seek to interweave

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:25,120
in a complex life-sustaining web

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,760
so uh those are the words of berenice

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,040
fisher

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,079
and joan c tronto from an academic

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,920
article that they co-authored in 1990

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:39,040
many other scholars as well as activists

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,360
who focus on a range of issues

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,320
disability justice anti-racism

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,720
queerness have built a huge body of work

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,920
around

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,240
care work and around an ethics of care

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,800
as

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,000
essential to community inclusion and

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
thriving for all

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,079
and that is a whole universe that we

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,800
could explore if we had all day

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,399
but let's start here for now now that

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,160
definition might sound a little bit

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,440
heady so let's bring it right back down

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,440
to earth

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,519
why do all of these scholars care so

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,839
much about care work

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,839
there are many layers to that question

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,399
but a big part of the answer is

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,279
economics because care work is very

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,320
frequently

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,880
either unpaid or underpaid

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,399
and yet as artist jenny odell put it

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,440
it's a type of work that makes

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,959
all other work possible

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,880
so when we talk about care work we are

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,240
talking about both the care work that we

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,240
do as part of our jobs

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,680
that's checking in with our colleagues

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,199
maintaining relationships and

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,320
communities

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,600
anything involving relationships empathy

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,360
repair maintenance support as well as

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,199
care work that we do outside of work

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,480
which might include tending to our own

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,639
physical needs

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,519
our children our elders and other family

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,760
members

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,760
community service and volunteer work

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,040
preparing meals doing the shopping

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,680
taking out the recycling

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,480
all of that stuff so it's a huge range

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,760
of things

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,240
we don't usually think of care work as

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,760
work and there are reasons for that um

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,800
broadly economic that i'll get to

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,199
momentarily but

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,000
first i want to just take another brief

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,160
detour

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,399
into how this typically plays out in the

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,519
tech sector specifically

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,240
so if we bring that definition of care

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,240
work back out

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,760
it includes everything we do to maintain

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,279
contribute and repair our world so that

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,959
we can live in it as well

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:36,079
as possible okay so you might notice

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:39,440
these words maintain and repair

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:42,720
these stood out to me very specifically

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,519
as very um familiar words to anybody

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,959
who's worked

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,839
in software right i think you probably

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,440
all get this and how much fun is

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,240
maintaining a project

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,600
fixing bugs it's not the glamorous part

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,160
of coding right

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,959
cleaning up technical debt this is all

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,160
largely

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,560
invisible to most people but like does

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,880
it

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,000
ever make the whole engine run more

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,000
smoothly right

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,399
so among your peers you might get some

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,160
recognition and appreciation for it but

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,079
beyond your inner circles

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,079
most people will just kind of go about

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,480
their lives without ever noticing

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,120
the ways that you improved it right it's

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,079
it's a

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,959
core infrastructure work and that's care

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,720
work right there

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,680
in a nutshell it's the work of

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,079
maintainers the work of infrastructures

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,600
the countless pesky bug fixes and

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,600
performance improvements that make

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,160
everyone else's work easier

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
make their work possible but that work

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,800
is frequently invisible

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,160
right it's hard to draw attention and

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,920
resources to it but there's another kind

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,320
of care work that's also prevalent

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,079
in tech and that in my experience has

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,040
some gendered connotations

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,680
i i touched on it very briefly it has to

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,600
do

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,120
with the way that even within technical

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,399
projects we have

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,399
certain roles that i call empathy roles

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,199
where a significant part of the job

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,039
involves

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,799
tuning into what other people want and

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,439
need and

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,799
caring about those things basically so

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,400
often these are roles where

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,520
you have to put yourself in the shoes of

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,160
someone else say ux work or qa

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,039
or documentation or even product

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,000
management

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,360
user research we also see this a lot in

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
community management

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,120
training onboarding new contribs all of

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,360
that stuff

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,880
so um or really anywhere where some

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,200
aspect of translation

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,280
is involved in a sense of translating

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,679
between different kinds of people

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,480
and their different sets of perspectives

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,720
and needs

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,559
so the people who do best in these roles

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,679
are skillful at being able to see things

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,240
from multiple

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,080
perspectives they have strong empathy

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,640
and communication skills

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,440
now all of us have to do some of this

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,000
work right

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
but in my 20 plus years in the tech

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,679
industry

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,640
i cannot count how many times other

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,559
women

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,640
non-binary and trans people have

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,840
confided in me that they've felt

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,760
pressured by managers or peers to move

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,440
into empathy roles rather than staying

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
in more technical ones

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,559
now i'll confess that this is somewhat

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,799
anecdotal

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,559
data but i've had many many

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,480
conversations about this and

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,600
they tell me they've had conversations

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,919
about this and

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,720
i just find it very interesting

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,760
especially since in some places

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,080
not all but some places these roles are

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,559
not

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,840
paid as well as more technical ones now

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,679
that's not to suggest that their

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,160
managers want them to earn less money

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,559
but i

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,679
i can't help wondering whether this

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,320
might be a factor

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,559
again of gender biases at play and

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,559
expectations that care work and empathy

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,679
work in particular

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,679
is for women so we certainly see larger

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,880
concentrations of women

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,919
in industries that rely on care work

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,280
such as hospitality health care and

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,160
service work

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,840
so it makes sense in a way that we would

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,720
have expectations

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,480
that our gender identity would somehow

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,840
magically grant us

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,320
you know an aptitude for care work but

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,360
um

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,080
back to economics care work is not well

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,400
paid

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,280
and it doesn't carry a lot of prestige

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,600
either

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,520
so there are real costs to these

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,080
assumptions if we delegate

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,280
all of the care work to women and trans

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,000
and non-binary people

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,440
right it doesn't lead to an equitable

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,400
distribution of work

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,720
income and power at least not if our

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,919
current economic reality persists and we

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,280
continue to equate

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,679
care work with lower skill so

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,559
this is a topic that we could discuss at

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,400
length

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,400
and i know i i haven't fashioned an

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
airtight case here but for the sake of

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,039
time i'm just going to kind of

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,480
drop in that observation and leave it

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,160
there as a question mark

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,000
so that we can cover everything that i

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,120
want to cover today

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,919
um let's talk for a moment

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,360
about prestige and status so you might

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,080
notice that care work

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,120
doesn't sound very glamorous caring for

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,720
our bodies

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,240
like that's just a thing that we need to

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,440
do to get through the day right

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,200
um three square meals bathing going to

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,919
the doctor once in a while

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,000
um and and then even if you put that in

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,000
the context of paid work

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,919
of professions that involve caring for

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,679
somebody else's body

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,039
well maybe being a doctor sounds

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,159
prestigious

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,640
but being a nurse or a home care worker

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,400
those are generally underpaid low status

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,559
jobs right

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
there's an inverse relationship

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,799
interestingly between the intimacy level

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,880
of these jobs and how highly we value

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,720
them

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,559
it's the same with educational roles so

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,320
higher education teaching is a higher

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,760
status job than early childhood

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,880
education

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,919
why well in part because we as a society

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,960
have decided that it

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,320
requires more skill to obtain a phd in

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,720
an obscure specialty

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,760
than it does to support the social

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,679
emotional

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,360
and cognitive development of infants

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,120
toddlers and preschoolers

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,280
but is that true i mean there's a

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,600
different skill set to be sure

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,559
and higher ed requires more schooling

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,320
but then

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,000
many of the early childhood educators

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,559
i've known have master's degrees

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,880
and they often start out with thousands

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,200
of hours of hands-on experience

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,159
because they've been babysitting and

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
nannying

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,240
and running camps for kids essentially

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,200
apprenticing their way

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,720
into being incredible experts at caring

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,720
for and educating young

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,480
children i know that personally as

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,440
someone who never did any of those

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,600
things

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,080
i've benefited enormously from the

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,520
expertise of paid caregivers and early

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,679
childhood educators

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,360
who just carry around incredible depths

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,440
of knowledge and understanding of

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,400
developmental models and diagnostic

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,039
skills

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,320
now i'm not saying that there's no logic

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,039
behind these economic

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,039
realities only that if we want to make

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,039
the invisible visible if we want to

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,760
value care work it's worth digging a

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,679
little

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,840
beneath these assumptions and really

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,440
asking ourselves how we as a society

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,919
want to value this work

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,720
and this expertise rather than simply

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,080
accepting

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,000
the current reality as a given i would

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,480
also argue that these social norms

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,120
around

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,840
care work and prestige factor heavily

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,080
into

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,039
our choices around how to prioritize

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,600
care work

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,360
both at home and in the workplace when

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,679
we think about what kind of work takes

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,679
precedence if we have to choose

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,159
about who performs which kind of work

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,799
more often even in the workplace

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,000
this association between care work and

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,480
lower status

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,080
has ramifications for how we perceive

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,520
ourselves within our families

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,120
and in our workplaces and so conversely

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,360
in families and workplaces where care

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,280
work is treated as a priority

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,360
and afforded status and appreciation

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,080
that makes a huge difference to how

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,080
people feel

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,080
and perform in those environments

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,200
okay care work in the pandemic um

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,400
there's that jenny odell quote again so

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,039
care work makes all

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,559
other work possible but it carries with

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,600
it no prestige

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:17,440
and either no pay or low pay

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,280
it's essential and yet we assign it no

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,080
economic value

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,120
so this tension has perhaps never been

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,000
quite so evident

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,320
to so many people at the same time as it

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,520
has

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,840
this year when the covid19 pandemic set

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,679
off

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,240
several care work crises all at once

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,280
so here's just a few categories of care

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,720
work that became

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:44,640
far more challenging in 2020 child

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:48,159
care elder care community care

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,840
education maintaining friendships

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,760
collaborating with our colleagues got

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,120
harder mental health

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,679
physical health um you know substance

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,919
use

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,279
so many issues so and as these things

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,440
became more challenging

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,360
they've also become more visible and

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,000
that is maybe the one thing

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,240
that i will give code coveted credit for

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,640
as far as silver linings go

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,000
there's nowhere for care work to hide

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,480
right now

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,400
parents in particular have faced a truly

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,640
overwhelming situation

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,520
working from home caring for children

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,840
full-time

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,159
and managing kids remote education it's

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,799
left every parent i know

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,640
frayed to the point that we've just kind

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,240
of resorted to playing like whose turn

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,600
is it to have a breakdown with one

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,039
another

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,279
but it's not just parents who've been

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,679
suffering obviously

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,520
so a few specific examples of the

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,240
challenges that particular groups

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,880
have been facing one and a half billion

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,480
children

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,720
were suddenly home 24 7. and daycare

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,360
centers closed or shifted to remote

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,679
schooling with varied success

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,400
and we had no grandparent backup either

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,520
due to the

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,520
increased risks in that age group covet

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,960
19 infections and deaths swept through

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,400
senior care facilities

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,240
at tragic rates exacerbated in part by

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,240
underpaid care workers

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,919
who were working multiple jobs to make

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,559
ends meet and had to travel between

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,120
facilities to do so

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,200
women's unemployment rates were and are

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,720
dramatically higher than men's

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,240
due in part to the gendered

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,400
concentration of jobs in

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,279
industries that were most affected by

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,679
kovitz so hospitality service

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,600
many women who live with men quit their

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,080
jobs to care for children

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,840
due to the untenable home situations

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,120
combined with the higher earning power

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,799
of their male partners

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,200
that's the headline that i cited at the

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,520
beginning of the talk

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,559
many individuals in higher risk groups

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,159
seniors people with disabilities

00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,960
immunocompromised people and so on

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,159
experienced

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,600
have experienced devastating isolation

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,240
and loneliness um with so many of us

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,640
shifting

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,640
suddenly and unexpectedly to remote work

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,240
and work from home setups

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,840
many of us are struggling to maintain a

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,000
sense of connection and closeness with

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,159
work colleagues

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,240
and to be clear these challenges will

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,000
not disappear overnight when a vaccine

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,240
is found

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,159
so on the question of women leaving the

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,120
workforce

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,559
experts are predicting that it will take

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,799
at least a decade

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,559
or more for women to recover the

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,760
progress they had been making in the

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,919
workforce

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,279
and that their career earnings will in

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,039
many cases

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,200
be decimated by the gap in their resumes

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,039
now why is it women leaving the

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,799
workforce in such disproportionate

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,960
numbers i mean part of it

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,039
as i as i sort of referenced earlier is

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
pure math right like women earn less

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,799
than men on average and so

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,000
for many heterosexual households with

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,919
kids if

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,919
they can only have one adult working for

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,840
pay then it just makes sense at least on

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,080
paper for the lower earning partner to

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,840
drop out and care for the kids

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,520
but there are a couple of other factors

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,760
here as well

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,919
first of all i mean if more workplaces

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,400
afforded all employees flexible

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,720
schedules and part-time options

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,440
then families wouldn't be put in a

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,360
position

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,799
of having to have one parent out of the

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,200
workforce that's something more

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,919
workplaces need to institute because

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,720
it makes an enormous difference to

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,880
employee and

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,200
retention and well-being and short and

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,840
long-term career outcomes for women

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,360
especially but there's another thing

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,279
that needs to be addressed

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,840
and this one is something that each of

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,919
us needs to address in our own lives

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,960
wherever it shows up both at work

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,320
and at home um which is care work

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,880
internet and gender

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,320
so you may have noticed that we've been

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,360
talking a lot about women here and

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,480
that's because

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,600
women are massively over-represented in

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,880
both paid

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,200
and unpaid care work so if we shift our

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,200
focus to unpaid care work

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,360
by which i mean things like child and

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,919
elder care but also household work

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,399
like cooking cleaning laundry all of

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,960
those unglamorous things that need to be

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,440
tended

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,080
so that we can function as whole healthy

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,159
humans

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,440
well um mckinsey research puts it very

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,559
plainly

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,240
around the world women do three times

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:19,360
as much on paid care work as men

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,120
and in case you're thinking oh maybe

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,200
there's a few outlier countries who are

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,399
really skewing the results there

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,840
i've got terrible news which is

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,919
um that this phenomenon is by no means

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,240
confined to developing economies it's a

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,880
consistent fact that women work a double

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,520
shift

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,039
in advanced economies too in the us for

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,279
instance women do

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:47,039
twice as much unpaid care work as men

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:49,600
so uh that's not great news but

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,799
just to drive home that it's also not a

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,799
matter of families

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,200
choosing to distribute paid care work

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,760
and

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,600
and paid you know other work um

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,600
equitably between their partners

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,440
more terrible news even among

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,120
individuals who earn the majority of

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,520
their households income

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,720
43 of women who are primary household

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,760
income earners

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,640
continue to do all or most of the

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,000
household work

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,919
compared with only 12 percent of men so

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,880
we have gender issues here um oh

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,640
and by the way uh also from mckinsey

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,039
this nice little tidbit

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,240
uh which is that the value if we if we

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,440
actually accounted

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,919
for unpaid care work in our economies

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,640
the value of that unpaid care work by

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,840
women is

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,120
10 trillion dollars or 13

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,440
of global gdp so

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,440
this also plays out at work right in

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,679
terms of how we distribute the jobs of

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,399
social connection and team building and

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,600
so on

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,320
i will never forget uh a male founder

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,159
who told me

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,320
very proudly that he had hired his first

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,120
woman to work at his previously all-male

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,200
company

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,399
and the very first thing out of his

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,760
mouth about her was

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,720
nothing about her role or her

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,120
qualifications it was ah she's so great

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,799
she makes us all break for lunch we're

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,080
all talking to each other now and we're

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,399
eating properly it's so

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,399
good she's like the office mom um

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,600
there have been so many articles and

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,880
books written

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,320
uh telling women to stop doing this work

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,399
in the office telling women how to be

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,880
taken more seriously and to opt out of

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,760
these

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,520
office mom roles now i don't necessarily

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,520
disagree that we could benefit

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,440
benefit from that approach but there is

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,679
a flip side to that which is

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,320
what if men valued care work enough to

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,840
prioritize it and take it on themselves

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,520
what if that male founder said to

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,440
himself you know what

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,039
these staff lunches are doing wonders

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,080
for everyone's well-being and their

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,559
productivity

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,440
and sort of general happiness in the

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,279
company

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,120
um the company's a better place to work

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,440
now you know maybe i should put this in

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,080
a

00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,760
in somebody's job description and pay

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,640
them for their time and energy and

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,120
expertise

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,399
in coordinating this right or what if he

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,919
decided to organize a few himself

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,760
and if we go back to unpaid care work

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,799
uh the work of maintaining a home a

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,679
family a community outside of work

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,080
again what if men decided to prioritize

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,840
that

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,080
and shoulder their share of it now i

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,480
know that this is probably the norm in

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,039
some of your countries so bear with me

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,519
um some of you are probably shaking your

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,559
heads

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,320
in denmark and iceland and so on but in

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,640
most parts of the world it is not the

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,519
norm and there's only so much that women

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,279
can do

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,720
to shift that discrepancy without a

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,960
little help

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,120
so uh this is another topic that we

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,919
could talk about for hours but again i

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,480
just want to

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,640
note it and also note that when we talk

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,240
about paid care work

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,320
we're also talking for the most part

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,360
about women so if you choose to pay

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,840
someone

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,600
to outsource some of this right to clean

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,679
your house and care for your kids and

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,960
look after your aging parents

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,760
odds are that that person is a woman and

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,080
she's probably underpaid um i'm laughing

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,760
it's not actually funny but

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,679
uh there's a lot of bad news to deliver

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,640
and trying to do it with a smile so

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,320
we all need to care and be cared for i

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,440
want to pause here so i want to pause

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,519
here and say

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,360
none of this is meant as a guilt trip

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,039
okay um

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,120
if you're doing less care work than

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,080
you'd like to be i definitely don't want

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,559
you

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,760
leaving this session feeling like you're

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,080
a terrible person

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,279
and if you're someone who really thrives

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,120
on so-called

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,640
productive work right in the economic

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,880
sense and you're in a position

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,039
to support a partner or hire help with

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,519
your own care needs that's great

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,120
my goal is not to add a layer of

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,679
judgment to care work

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,399
and say that it's more valuable or more

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,039
important than

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,399
other forms of work it's simply to make

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,200
it more visible

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,000
and to say hey this work matters and

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,960
it's happening

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,200
it's getting done often with great skill

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,600
let's acknowledge it and how crucial it

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,840
is

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,840
to us getting anything else done

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,360
so what happens when we make care work

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,480
more visible there's

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,679
layers and layers to this issue but for

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,039
today

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:20,720
the main things i want you to ponder are

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,679
for yourself what kinds of care work

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,360
are you currently performing and where

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,679
do you benefit from the care work of

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,679
others

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,200
um what kinds of care work do you wish

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,960
that you could be doing what kinds of

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,440
care work do you wish others were doing

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,159
for you

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,919
and how are some external forces like

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,120
the pandemic the work from home

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,240
situation

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,279
um health economics family roles and

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,799
responsibilities

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,640
and other factors how how are those

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,760
external forces constraining your

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,919
capacity

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,440
to give and receive care because those

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,240
things matter too right

00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,600
so asking these questions is all part of

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,360
making the invisible visible

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,600
i also invite you to ask in your

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,720
workplace how do you value

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,359
care and maintenance work there how do

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,200
you wish

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,879
that it were valued and is there a

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,879
difference between the two

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,879
now my hope is that through this talk i

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,480
will

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:25,040
open up a space of inquiry for you to

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,119
just consider these questions and and

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,359
how we might reimagine our work

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,119
and our personal lives in ways that make

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:35,839
care work more visible

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,839
more respected and more valued

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,919
i want to take a very brief moment for

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,079
those of you who in

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,320
the room who might have the power to

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,200
shift workplace policies i just want to

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,359
share

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,679
the key recommendations from this

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,639
mckinsey report on coping 19 and gender

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,399
equality

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,320
um their recommendations are for

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,399
business leaders i think it goes for

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,320
you know leaders in any sector their

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,720
number one recommendation

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,800
is to is simply to make end

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,920
interventions to reduce

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,960
gender imbalance in responsibility for

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,400
unpaid care work

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,800
and they recommend that leaders act now

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,000
to make the following interventions so

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,560
flexible

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,040
and part-time work options that's number

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,599
one

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,520
um in all of these you know in every

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,440
report on every

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,960
thing i've read flexible and part-time

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,599
work options number one

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,400
child care policies um this one i think

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,079
is worth noting

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,320
rethinking performance reviews and

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,720
evaluations in light of how the pandemic

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,040
is

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,480
affecting households i think that's so

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,320
critical this year

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,320
a professionalized child care industry

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,079
we don't all have control over that but

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,200
for those of you in larger organizations

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,000
you may have

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,599
some ability to influence that and

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,200
redistributing

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,520
the responsibilities for care work so

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,359
with any of you who do have the power to

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,200
make these kinds of changes i really do

00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,920
hope that you'll take note

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,920
as i bring this to a close i want to

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,560
revisit the phrase that i put up on the

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,320
screen

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,440
at the very beginning um

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,640
about a vision for people first

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,839
technology community and future

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:22,000
people first is how i found my way

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:24,320
into technology and people first is also

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,040
one of our most fundamental values at

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,520
and yet

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,240
the company where i work um building a

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,839
people first

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,520
project of any kind demands empathy

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,920
it demands care right um

00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,440
[Music]

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,920
and yet ceo sarah avenir uses gardening

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,760
metaphors a lot to talk about business

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,200
and leadership and team building and

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,440
community um

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,040
and even technology gardening is

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,480
inherently care work right it's

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,920
maintenance it's repair

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,680
it's tending to the weeds it's

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,440
nourishing the roots

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,800
gardeners are care workers and

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,720
productive workers

00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,839
they're planting growing and harvesting

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,240
they're feeding

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,839
everyone now that might not be a

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,400
metaphor that's commonplace

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,960
in tech organizations gardening does not

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,520
scale

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,000
10x it does not produce hockey stick

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,760
growth

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,359
or any of those other metaphors that are

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,599
prevalent in our industry

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,520
but a garden is a place where many

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,440
beings can thrive

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,880
and we're giving and receiving care is

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,480
all part of the cycle

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,320
where things bear fruit where

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,160
sustainability is key

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,599
and where a little bit of maintenance

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,200
makes all the difference

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,359
i've probably worn this metaphor into

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,760
the ground but i will say this much we

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,119
all

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,839
need space and time for productive work

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,200
and for care work this is not an either

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,800
or it's a both

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,400
and we can all

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,119
pitch in in the people first technology

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,760
garden

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,079
we can contribute our own care work we

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,240
can appreciate and make visible the care

00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,920
work of others

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,680
we can look for ways to support our

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,839
colleagues who are at higher risk of

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,800
having their care responsibilities

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,079
overwhelm their capacity for paid work

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,560
we can help more at home

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,119
or we can help less if that's an option

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,400
we can look for ways to compensate paid

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,160
care workers better

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,880
and to afford them more prestige and

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,839
respect we can notice who is being

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,320
tapped for empathy roles on our projects

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,320
and

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,920
what opportunities those roles afford in

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,920
the long term

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,200
we can pay attention to whose voices are

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,960
included

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,480
and who's aren't even in the room

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,480
thank you so much for your time and

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,200
attention i'm imagining that at least

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,000
some of you

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,480
are watching this while performing care

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,480
work

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,839
of some kind and that thought brings me

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,079
a lot of joy

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,280
so if you're doing care work in any

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,359
capacity

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,599
whether it's right in this moment or in

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,760
general i hope that if you take away

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,720
just one thing it's this

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,640
i see you we see you and your work

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,760
matters so much

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,320
i hope that i've given you some

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,000
vocabulary with which to consider

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,760
and talk about care work and to make it

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,160
more visible and valued

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,960
for yourself for your family your

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:11,520
community

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,520
