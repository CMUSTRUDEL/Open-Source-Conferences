	Improve Your Security Posture: Rapid Patching for OS CVEs in CF for K8s - Piyali Banerjee & Paul Warren, VMware

In CF for K8s, the responsibility of keeping the stack (root filesystem/OS) for applications up-to-date when a security vulnerability has been patched has moved from Diego to the CF API. With this new feature, you will be able to purposefully and selectively trigger stack updates. In this Lightning Talk, Piyali and Paul will show how you can upgrade the stacks of running apps in cf-for-k8s without incurring downtime.
