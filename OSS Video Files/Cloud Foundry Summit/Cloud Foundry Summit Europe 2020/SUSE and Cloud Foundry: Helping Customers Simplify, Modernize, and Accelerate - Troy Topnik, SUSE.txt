	SUSE and Cloud Foundry: Helping Customers Simplify, Modernize, and Accelerate - Troy Topnik, SUSE

SUSE has been at the forefront of adopting Kubernetes as a platform for running Cloud Foundry. As part of our mission to help our customers adopt cloud-native technologies, we've learned that the path to successful utilization of Kubernetes can be difficult - for end user software developers, for platform operators, and even for Cloud Foundry itself. This session will summarize how KubeCF, Quarks, and Stratos are building a bridge for platform operators from current BOSH-based releases to the next generation of Cloud Foundry components currently under development.
