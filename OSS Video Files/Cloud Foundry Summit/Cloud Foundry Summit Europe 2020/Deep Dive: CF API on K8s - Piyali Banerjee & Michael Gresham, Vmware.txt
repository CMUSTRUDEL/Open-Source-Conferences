	Deep Dive: CF API on K8s - Piyali Banerjee & Michael Gresham, Vmware

What happens when the strengths of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes are combined? A radically enhanced experience for developers and operators. This talk provides an overview of the work the CF API team (CAPI) has done over the past year to evolve the Cloud Foundry API to work natively with Kubernetes. Piyali will cover how the CF API server and related components are organized in the cluster, and how major workflows supported by the CF API (i.e.: app staging, stack updates, deployment) works in a system without BOSH and Diego through some exciting demos! Mike (CAPI PM) will share what CAPIâ€™s roadmap will look like for the rest of 2020.
