	Debugging Cloud Foundry Apps: Via Service Mesh, Open Tracing - Idit Levine, Solo.io

The mainstreaming of containerization and microservices is raising a critical question by both developers and operators: how do we debug all this?

Debugging microservices applications is a difficult task. The state of the application is spread across multiple microservices, and it is hard to get a holistic view of the state of the application. Currently debugging of microservices is assisted by openTracing, which helps in tracing of a transaction or workflow for post-mortem analysis, and linkerd and itsio which monitor the network to identify latency problems. These tools however, do not allow to monitor and interfere with the application during run time.

In this talk, we will describe and demonstrate common debugging techniques and we will introduce Squash, a new tool and methodology.
