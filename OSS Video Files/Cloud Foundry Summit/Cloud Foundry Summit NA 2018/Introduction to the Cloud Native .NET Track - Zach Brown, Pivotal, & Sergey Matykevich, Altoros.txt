everybody let's go ahead and get started

00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:08,480
first I wanted to say welcome to Cloud

00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,440
Foundry summit but even more exciting

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,139
than that welcome to the first ever

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,439
cloud native dotnet tract at any Cloud

00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,989
Foundry summit so Cloud Foundry has been

00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,599
polyglot since the beginning but it's

00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:25,939
one thing to say our platform supports

00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,960
all the languages and it's another thing

00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:33,379
to have all the rich features the tools

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,739
the management support etc that you need

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:38,210
to run real workloads in production if

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:40,100
you if you look around at Cloud Foundry

00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,620
summit there's there's actually quite a

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,269
lot of dotnet buzz going on this time

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,510
around it's very exciting we're kind of

00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:50,120
at an inflection point we had a dotnet

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,280
on Cloud Foundry training class before

00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,339
the summit kicked off as part of the the

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,350
pre summit trading lineup there was a

00:00:55,339 --> 00:01:00,109
demo yesterday how many of you also saw

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,960
the demo with the light bulbs very cool

00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:05,360
net demo integrating as your cognitive

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,150
api's and all kinds of cool stuff in the

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,670
in the stack there there will be a demo

00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,460
tomorrow during the keynotes

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,890
highlighting remote server debugging on

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,530
Windows 2016 server inside the Cloud

00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,680
Foundry so some very very cool stuff is

00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,710
happening and now we have a great full

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,100
track of cloud native dotnet talks at

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,900
cloud foundry summit so I work for

00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,060
pivotal as part of my job I get to speak

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,880
to customers and I've spoken to quite a

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,730
few customers who are running workloads

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,220
dotnet workloads in production on Cloud

00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,740
Foundry and in some cases those are

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,190
internal business apps but in other

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,770
cases they are public facing high scale

00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,600
massively scale applications that do

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,950
financial transactions and drive the

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,190
revenue of the companies that they

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,670
belong to I mean so very very exciting

00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,110
stuff that that they're using this for

00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,420
these companies are running hundreds or

00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,990
in some cases thousands of application

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,690
instances on the platform and so so

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,820
really we we've come a long way and it's

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,920
about time that we claim our our

00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,540
rightful place here in cloud foundry

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,090
Summit

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,400
today or over the next couple of days in

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,800
this track we've got a bunch of great

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,519
talks we've got a couple of talks from

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,269
Microsoft and then there are talks from

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,190
pivotal as well some customer talks from

00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:33,620
real practitioners that are using cloud

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,569
foundry and dotnet Charles Schwab will

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,170
be here traveler's insurance will be

00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:41,989
here we've also got quite a few partner

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,599
talks including Altos and grape up and

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,730
cognizant so there are some some

00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,549
excellent things for you here to see

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,340
whether you are just starting on that

00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,500
journey or whether you are already well

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,940
on your way to running Cloud Foundry

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,489
there there should be definitely

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,380
something here for you to take away I

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:04,370
put together this track together with my

00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:08,360
co-chair his name's Sergei Sergei wants

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:10,069
to say a few words and and also maybe

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,120
highlight some of the talks that he's

00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:16,880
excited about sure and Zac this year it

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,950
was the first time I helped to select

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,799
topics for called founder summit and I

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,670
honestly was very impressed by the

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,950
number of good talks that we had and it

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,260
was very difficult to select because we

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:35,209
argued with Zach a lot and because we're

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:38,180
all talks were great and yeah one thing

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,000
that I want to highlight is that we have

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:45,139
talks that are very good for beginners

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,030
for examples ones that can teach you 12

00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:54,880
factor apps in a practical way and we

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:59,840
have topics for more advanced users like

00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:01,430
deep dive in ice p.net core and we will

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,620
have one of my favorite topic about

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,780
f-sharp how we can deploy it on the

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,470
platform it will be very interesting for

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,910
me to attend this one and my own topic

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,299
about troubleshooting the net

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,450
applications where I want to share some

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,750
internals

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:20,810
of how platform works and how we can

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,740
utilize those features I was also

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,390
impressed how many submissions were from

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,260
companies that already have been using

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,900
dotnet

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,320
though the support is pretty new but we

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:36,050
have a lot of success stories from

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,670
companies like travelers that already

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:43,360
use the net in and that's great so I'm

00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,640
honestly very excited about this and

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:51,050
it's very great that we have this track

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,790
and welcome everybody to dotnet track I

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,850
hope it will be a great experience for

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,850
everybody

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,810
