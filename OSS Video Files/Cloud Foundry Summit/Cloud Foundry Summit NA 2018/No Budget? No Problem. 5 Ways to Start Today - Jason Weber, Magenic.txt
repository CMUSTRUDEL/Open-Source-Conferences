	No Budget? No Problem. 5 Ways to Start Today - Jason Weber, Magenic

 This session may be of interest if 3 things are true. One, you have a legacy (possibly massive) .NET-based monolithic application that your business relies on. Two, you would like to modernize this application and/or make it cloud-native but currently lack the budget to do so. Three, you wonder if there is anything you can do today to get a head start on this non-trivial effort.

Good news, the answer is “yes!” In this session you’ll learn 5 concrete and incremental changes you can begin today that will help you gain that head start in place. Why do next year what you can begin next week?

This session is geared towards decision makers and managers with a technical background. In addition to the checklist, you'll also see a few concrete examples (code) that illustrate the main points discussed.
