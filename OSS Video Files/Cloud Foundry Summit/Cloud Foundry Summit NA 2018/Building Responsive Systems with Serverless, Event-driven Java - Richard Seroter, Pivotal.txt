	Building Responsive Systems with Serverless, Event-driven Java - Richard Seroter, Pivotal & Asir Vedamuthu Selvasingh, Microsoft

 Speed. It matters in software. Not going fast just for the sake of it. No, it's about learning quickly and delivering insight and capabilities that move you forward. How does event processing make this possible? What role does serverless technology play? In this talk, Richard from Pivotal and Asir from Microsoft take a look at event-driven architectures, and how to realize it with a Java-centric solution. This solution collects data from around the world and reveals real-time insight. The presenters will demonstrate all the components, including Spring Boot, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Functions, and Spring Cloud Function. After this talk, attendees will have the knowledge they need to deliver modern, responsive systems.
