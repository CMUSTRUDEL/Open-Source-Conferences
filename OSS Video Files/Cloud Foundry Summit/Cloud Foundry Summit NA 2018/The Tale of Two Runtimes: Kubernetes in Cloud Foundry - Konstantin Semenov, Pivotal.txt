	The Tale of Two Runtimes: Kubernetes in Cloud Foundry - Konstantin Semenov, Pivotal

 The Container Runtime, CFCR, has been recently introduced as part of the Cloud Foundry Foundation. It leverages Kubernetes to run all sorts of workloads.

The core CFCR team has been busy making sure that CFCR runs on multiple platforms, provides high availability, follows the best security practises, and integrates with CFAR, previously known as the Elastic Runtime.

As part of this presentation, a demo will be presented showing how 12-factor apps running on Application Runtime can leverage 3-rd party Docker packaged software with persistence, and what will happen during an infrastructure failure.

Attend this talk if you're interested in learning the available features of CFCR, or if you may be wondering when to use it, and how to get the best of both Application Runtime and the Container Runtime by using them alongside each other. 

About Konstantin Semenov
Konstantin is a Principal Software Engineer at Pivotal. He spent most of 2017 with his colleagues from Pivotal, Google and vmWare building CFCR (a.k.a Kubo) â€“ an open source automated reliable, reproducible and highly available Kubernetes deployment. Before that he was leading and developing software products across a wide range of industries and technologies: from desktop database applications through telecom servers and transactional banking systems to mobile applications and 3D model generators. As a speaker, he gave the first Kubo presentation together with his colleagues from Google at the CF Summit 2017 in Santa Clara, spoke about CFCR at DevOps Days in Galway, and has given talks at tech meetups in Dublin and Belfast.
