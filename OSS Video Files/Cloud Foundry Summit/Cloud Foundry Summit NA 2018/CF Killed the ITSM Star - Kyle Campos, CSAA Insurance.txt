	CF Killed the ITSM Star - Kyle Campos, CSAA Insurance

The enterprise change process is filled with tickets, approvals and all forms of non-deterministic change review and time wasting gates that dominate the ITSM landscape. Cloud Foundry has thrown a monkey wrench into ITSM in the form of high velocity change via CI/CD and a healthy embrace of the DevOps "automate all the things" mantra.

Our DevOps and PCF platform leader, Kyle Campos, will talk about how we at CSAA are raising the quality and security bars of the platform even as deployment velocity increases through infrastructure and application CI/CD pipelines and how automation can serve the ITSM overlords through higher levels of determinism.
