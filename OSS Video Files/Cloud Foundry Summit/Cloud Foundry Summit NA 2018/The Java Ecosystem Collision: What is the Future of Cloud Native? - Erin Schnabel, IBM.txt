	The Java Ecosystem Collision: What is the Future of Cloud Native? - Erin Schnabel, IBM

 Changes in cloud orchestration technologies have started to push the boundaries between Cloud Native applications and their environment.

The notion of smart endpoints gave rise to shared libraries, like Ribbon from Netflix, to encapsulate outbound service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance. Now new technologies, like Istio, call that paradigm into question, suggesting those concerns should move out of the app and back into the infrastructure. What does that mean for Java applications using Netflix integrations in Spring Cloud?

The emergence of reactive programming is also pressing against the dominance of REST. Should everything be reactive now?

From shared libraries to sidecars, buildpacks to containers, Erin will demonstrate how different Java application frameworks are adapting to the changing Cloud Native landscape.
