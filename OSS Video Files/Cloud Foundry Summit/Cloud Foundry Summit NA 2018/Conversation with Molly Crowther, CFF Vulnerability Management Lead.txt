00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,590
Molly Crowther has been leading security

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,030
for Cloud Foundry for the last couple of

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,529
years is going to come up on stage and

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,320

up to come on stage Molly

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:29,470

we only have the wind slide and I'm not

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,920
gonna put you two on the spot actually I

00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:49,809
am but Cloud Foundry Security's been

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,379
busy for the last year

00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,610
yeah we've been extremely busy I wanted

00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:56,890
to put up this slide just to give

00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,080
everybody an idea of what all of the

00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,500
open-source teams have been up to

00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,229
it's only been 213 working days since

00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,500
the last summit in Santa Clara and this

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:10,030
is just kind of a smattering of what I

00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,530
could get people to tell me on Friday

00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,390
afternoon about what they've done about

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,950
2:30 really yep seems way longer yeah

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,720
and this is also just you know in less

00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,450
than a year you just you've done a few

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,329
things one or two yeah and it means that

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,870
people who stay up to date with the

00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:30,030
latest CF deployment get all of this

00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,990
we're really excited about it

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,909
well I don't know why everyone is not

00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,340
like just like taking photos and an oh

00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:39,250
this is an impressive undertaking by

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,840
anyone but for us Cloud Foundry we

00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,460
talked a lot about the enterprises and

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,640
running at scale and one of the core

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,140
features of that is obviously security

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,570
definitely I mean you're getting a

00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,310
platform that's doing a lot for you that

00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,520
you don't have to rely on your team's to

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,979
do and allows you to be faster and your

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,330
teams to be faster because you don't

00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,060
have to put them to work building

00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,950
security into a platform for you you

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,299
made a good point a couple weeks I heard

00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,790
you talking about this you made a really

00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,080
good point about the role agility plays

00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,390
we talk a lot about continuous delivery

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,909
and CI CD but what role does that play

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,189
in security yeah so we've been thinking

00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:17,409
a lot and I think the industry is kind

00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,879
of coming to a point where the thing

00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,430
everybody is talking about is shifting

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,129
security to the left and that means like

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,640
in the timeline of the delivery of your

00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:29,590
software you want to take security from

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,689
being the gatekeeper at the end and

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,079
pushing it as far forward in the process

00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:36,910
as possible so that your developers are

00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:39,490
thinking about security they're building

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,220
security in at the beginning and it's

00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,710
something that you're delivering through

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,330
value to your customers rather than just

00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,070
being somebody at the end telling you no

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,200
you can't ship that because I've decided

00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,940
it's not secure how many people have

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,450
that security department right now the

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,800
latter the no one Oh

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,480
so everybody's continuous delivery

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,060
that's great yes everyone's already

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,650
doing agile security but you know is

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,670
your security is everyone's job right

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,920
definitely

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,370
that's something that we've been working

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,830
on really hard over the past I mean

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,910
since I've been with cloud foundry one

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,460
of the cool things that we've been doing

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,050
this year is traveling around and doing

00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,970
agile security workshops with the

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,720
different product teams for cloud

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:28,300
foundry that helps them shift security

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,610
to the left in their own part of the

00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,580
product and it means that we get all of

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,290
these features coming out of the teams

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,980
themselves like I'm not running around

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:41,230
the world telling like Cappy they have

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,209
to map LDAP roles like that would be

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,800
super boring for me I get to go around

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,780
and talk to teams about why security is

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,910
important and this is kind of just like

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,500
what falls out of it if you could

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,690
summarize why security is important

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,900
really succinctly how would you how

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,709
would you I think for Cloud Foundry it's

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,860
like the number one thing because we're

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:05,590
enabling developers at all of the

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,890
companies that are here today huge

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,260
productivity gains right and when we do

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,940
that it means that they're touching more

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,560
of their customers they're touching more

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,330
people around the country and around the

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,930
world and we need to keep those people

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,070
safe

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:24,610
and that's how Cloud Foundry as a

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,820
platform is enabling security to reach

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,660
you know millions more people every day

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,520
that's so exciting

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,320
so as we think about the future we

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,500
talked a lot of today about where we're

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,050
going in 2018 and 2019 where do you see

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,150
us going with security it's really

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,860
exciting I mean there's different kinds

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,840
of threats that are emerging all the

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,380
time we're trying to stay agile trying

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,860
to stay ahead of those kinds of threats

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,480
we're building stronger teams

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:57,240
both kind of within the foundation to

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,100
understand what's going on but also

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,840
building that knowledge within each of

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,380
the product team so they can execute

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,000
themselves quickly and agile II too like

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,430
anything that comes up it's really

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,680
exciting awesome but it's so awesome and

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,050
and you've been on fire the last couple

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,240
of years with notifications around CVS

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,410
how many people of you are how many of

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,270
you are on the security Channel in slack

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:26,490
couple all right it should be everybody

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,590
but Molly's and a lot of the postings in

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,300
the security channel in slack on CBS and

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,250
updates and and what we're doing to

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,530
address them and I think that's been

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,410
such a phenomenal transparency into the

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,840
process for an open source project yeah

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,150
it's made my job easier and it gets

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,640
easier over time as people kind of get

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:48,210
more used to hearing about there's this

00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,580
problem that you need to obtain to fix I

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,580
think over time people get a little bit

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,400
less scared about these particular

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,650
issues and more confident that they know

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,980
that they can update really quickly

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:03,990
patch their stem cells I mean we patched

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,450
you know meltdown inspector as soon as

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,060
we had patches available and there were

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,130
people who are able to fix this horrible

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,340
issue in their foundation like in less

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:17,190
than a day in less than a day yeah holy

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,440
cow which is I would say unprecedented

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,710
yes

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,710
that's impressive

00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:27,089
anything you'd like to leave this

00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:28,769
audience with anything you've spend a

00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,239
lot of time talking about security and

00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:31,349
agility and how to make it part of your

00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:33,329
day today anything you would like to

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:36,029
leave them with yeah I just think that

00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:38,309
as we were saying before Security's

00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:40,499
everyone's job if we're gonna go faster

00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:43,949
as an industry people are gonna kind of

00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:47,339
get out of under their compliance team

00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:49,829
so you need to understand you know how

00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,619
to make security not everyone's problem

00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:54,300
but like everyone's value proposition

00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:56,249
that's awesome well that's a great note

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,499
to leave everybody on it's everybody's

00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:01,349
job Molly thank you so much for joining

00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:03,679
us I guess what a little bit see you in

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,679
