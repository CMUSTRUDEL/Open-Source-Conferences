Description: 
	A Deep Dive into Modernization Patterns to Get Your Mission Critical Applications to the Cloud - Shaun Anderson, Pivotal

 Shaun will be taking you through several of the most common patterns he and his colleagues have compiled from experience on more than 45 modernization projects. These technical patterns were driven out by the desire to strangle business critical functionality out of legacy monoliths and push to the cloud without impacting current business flow. These patterns can be used to move functionality to the cloud in days and weeks rather than months and years.

Pattern Categories include:

* Strangling the Monolith
* Event Shunting
* Proxies / Facades / Adapters
* Gateways
