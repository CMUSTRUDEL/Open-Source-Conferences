	Test Driven Development for Microservices Using Spring Cloud Contracts & Cloud Foundry - Reshmi Krishna & Adib Saikali, Pivotal

TDD introduced many improvements into the development process, but in our opinion the biggest impact relates to code design. Looking at the code from the usage perspective (by first writing an acceptance test) allows us to focus on usability rather than concrete implementation. Unfortunately, we usually rest on our laurels not trying to uplift this practice to the architecture level.

Consumer driven contracts (CDC) are like TDD applied to the API. It’s especially important in the world of microservices. Since it’s driven by consumers, it’s much more user friendly. Of course microservices are really cool, but most people do not take into consideration plenty of potential obstacles that should be tackled. Then instead of frequent, fully automated deploys via a delivery pipeline, you might end up in an asylum due to frequent mental breakdowns caused by production disasters.

This presentation will show you how you can use the Spring Cloud Contracts to have a fully automated solution to a consumer driven testing disasters. We will then deploy all these applications to Cloud Foundry. At the end, you will see how easy is it to write applications that have a consumer driven API and that will allow a developer to speed up the time of writing his better quality software.
