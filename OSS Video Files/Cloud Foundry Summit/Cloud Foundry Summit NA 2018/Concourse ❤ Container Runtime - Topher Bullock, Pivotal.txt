	Concourse ❤ Container Runtime - Topher Bullock, Pivotal

Concourse has become an indispensable CI/CD tool in the Cloud Foundry community and has been widely adopted to deploy CF on any infrastructure using BOSH, as well as deploy applications to the CF Application Runtime.The Concourse team is excited at the announcement of CF's new Container Runtime and the more granular control and management of containers it provides.

The new Container Runtime provides new opportunities for CF developers to deploy containerized workloads, and Concourse will be there to help the CF community deploy and manage those workloads... continuously!

Topher - the anchor of the core Concourse team at Pivotal - will cover how Concourse can help users deploy new containerized workloads to the Cloud Foundry Container Runtime and present new features on the roadmap aimed at capitalizing on this amazing new capability in the platform.
