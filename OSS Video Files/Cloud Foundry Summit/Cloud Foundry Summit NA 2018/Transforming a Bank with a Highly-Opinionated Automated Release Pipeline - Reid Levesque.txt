	Transforming a Bank with a Highly-Opinionated Automated Release Pipeline - Reid Levesque, Royal Bank of Canada

Can development teams focus on developing business logic while avoiding the bureaucratic jungle to get to production? Microservices are great at speeding up development time and shortening the feedback loop -- unless every team has to build a pipeline from scratch. In an organization used to monthly or quarterly releases, moving to daily or hourly deployments requires more than a change in application architecture.

This session will cover how weâ€™ve automated all the things while still giving developers the freedom to be successful.
