	How Did Our Garden Grow? Advances in the Cloud Foundry App Runtime's Container Engine - Julian Friedman, IBM

 Garden (the Cloud Foundry App Runtime's container engine, optimised for PaaS workloads) has had some incredibly cool upgrades in the past year. From massive security upgrades -- the ability to run without root, a first in the container ecosystem for a production runtime -- to experimenting with big performance and UX changes by exploiting layered images rather than untarring droplets to the new "Garden Peas" feature enabling sidecar containers for Cloud Foundry, this has been a very exciting year. This talk will cover everything operators and developers need to know about the runtime at the heart of Cloud Foundry.

As well as introducing the new features, the talk will explain how operators can interact with the runtime container bundles generated by Garden to debug, extend and operate the platform.
