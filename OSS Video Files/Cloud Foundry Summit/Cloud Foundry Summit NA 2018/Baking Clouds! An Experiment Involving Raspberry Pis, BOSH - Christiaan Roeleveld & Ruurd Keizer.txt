Description: 
	Baking Clouds! An Experiment Involving Raspberry Pis, BOSH - Christiaan Roeleveld & Ruurd Keizer, ITQ

 In this session, we will demo an experiment in which we run Cloud Foundry (workloads) on a bunch of Raspberry Pis. As Raspberry is ARM instead of x86, and has no virtualization, we had to work through the whole stack, including the creation of a minimal IaaS, BOSH CPI, ARM stemcells, BOSH agent, and a buildpack. We will talk about each of these, the architecture and what we learned along the way. Did we say *live demo* yet?

Prior to this he was active as developer working predominantly with C#/.NET, C++, and Go. In a distant past, he earned a PhD in experimental physics working on superconductivity and quantum nanoscience. Ruurd has performed at several conferences, ranging from the NLVMUG (1k+ attendees), to the Low Temperature Physics Conference. 

About Christiaan Roeleveld
Christiaan works as a consultant at ITQ. After years of building cloud automation solutions based on VMware products he finally found the cloud-native path. He is now talking about Cloudfdoundry, helping customers implement Cloudfoundry, a huge bosh fan and does some Go coding on the side. Christiaan is currently helping the Dutch Road and water authority to extend their PCF platform Speaking experience: Many talks at VMware Usergroup Conferences in europe.
