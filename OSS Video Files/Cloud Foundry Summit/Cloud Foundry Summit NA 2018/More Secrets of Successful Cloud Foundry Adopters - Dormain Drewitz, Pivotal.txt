	More Secrets of Successful Cloud Foundry Adopters - Dormain Drewitz, Pivotal

 What are the practices and hallmarks of organizations that are running Cloud Foundry at scale? How did they get started? How did they attract hundreds of developers and equip them to deploy thousands of applications?

2017 was a year when more enterprises hit critical mass with their Cloud Foundry deployments. The best part? They shared details of how they did it. Team structures, enablement tactics, target applications… there is a growing body of examples to learn from. But you have to absorb it all! Is there a Readers’ Digest version? Yes. Yes there is.

Wherever you are on your digital transformation journey, learn from your predecessors. In this talk, Dormain Drewitz distills the learnings from several companies using Cloud Foundry. She shares the patterns around strategies, processes, and tactics.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,649
I'm gonna get started partly because I

00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:11,010
only have 76 slides for a 30 minute spot

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,240
it's probably imperative that I move

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,009
quickly because I actually do have

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,859
probably bout 30 slides for a 30 minute

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,109
spot

00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:21,750
my name is Dharma Andrew it's a senior

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,939
director of product marketing customer

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:30,119
marketing various forms of partner

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:32,099
marketing and other things at pivotal so

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,719
this is the talk that's the secrets of

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,820
successful cloud foundry users I

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,860
realized that my slide with the

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,450
fire-escape

00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,129
reminders somehow didn't make it into

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,239
this version so I will just verbally

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:48,059
tell you that those are the exits and to

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,379
proceed in an orderly fashion so as to

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,719
not trample each other and successfully

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,510
back through the building with that what

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,300
do I mean by successful cloud foundry

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,229
adopters I picked a handful of examples

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,049
a lot of this really began after cf some

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,990
in North America last year which if how

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,180
many folks were there show hands

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,740
barring rotator cuff industry injuries

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,049
that prevent people from raising hands

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,970
whenever asked questions in public

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,170
presentations okay so some of you were

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,799
there

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,890
I was also trapped chair for the

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:32,009
enterprise track then as I was this year

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:35,430
with Greg Otto and listened to a lot of

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,840
the customer talks and just started to

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,790
put together some patterns that I

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,670
noticed and this grew over time

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,399
throughout the course the year you know

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,549
I see if summit in Basel and then at

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,560
spring one platform and San Francisco in

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,570
December you know various other

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,990
interviews and case studies and whatnot

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,420
that I had the opportunity to work on I

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,299
sort of extended the set of patterns

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,700
that I had so all these are based on

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:07,190
some kind of publicly referenceable talk

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,780
or podcast or video or what-have-you but

00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,300
just to kind of frame what I mean by

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,830
successful there were things like Garmin

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,450
who

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,720
highlighting how you know hey we're at

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:21,080
1100 deploys per month and this was as

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,540
of last June so I'm you know want to

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,840
hear what the update is now that it's

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,850
been 10 months Comcast's sites things

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,710
like a 50 percent improvement in time to

00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,900
market Liberty Mutual highlights

00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,580
therefore weekend bps now as you've

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,280
probably noticed a lot of this is

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,760
inextricable from you know not just

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,880
technology but practices that have to go

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,710
along with it and so really when you

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,350
look at this set of patterns it's all

00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,240
about much more the people and process

00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:55,340
side of things and less about the

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,320
technology so the one of the key

00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,660
takeaways is when you look across all

00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,760
these really successful examples that we

00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,140
have in the Cloud Foundry community I

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,140
was just in listening to the Air Force

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,540
and the government track and you know

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:12,130
they're there now the median time to

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:15,620
deliver in the Air Force was a years and

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:18,170
you know they now have four examples of

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,440
projects they've gone from you know

00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:24,530
concept to operations in an average of

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,560
124 calendar days and so you know just a

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,660
huge transformation in the speed at

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,940
which they're able to deliver to war

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,980
fighters and then you heard some of the

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,300
examples that I just said you know

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,940
they're not takeaway of that is like

00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,160
listen it's not a technology problem

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,370
that's a solved problem what's

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,400
preventing the rest of the world and the

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,810
rest of organizations to see those types

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,130
of results so the first secret something

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,040
that I kept hearing from a lot of

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:58,160
customers starting back at cf7 last year

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,019
was they mentioned the dojo and you know

00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,120
this is something I started to dig into

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:05,630
and learn more about Kevin's here in the

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,690
room the pivotal has a dojo practice

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,480
that's part of the onboarding of the

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,549
actual platform itself and as they

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,739
started to poke around and and learn and

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:17,090
listen and actually Garmin and pointed

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,380
and Jonathan because he's in third road

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,450
here talked about doing it twice and

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,390
I you know really that they kind of

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,700
weren't ready for the first time and

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:32,590
they they came to it a second time with

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:34,570
a much more prepared mindset what I

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,690
realize is that you know a lot of

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,030
enterprise software purchasing you have

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,670
kind of that line item that gets sort of

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,420
tacked on there that's the installation

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:50,080
consulting service from the vendor and

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:52,270
that that usually happens where okay we

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,710
bought some software and now some some

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,990
consultants from the vendor are gonna

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,580
come in they're gonna go install it and

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,580
then they sort of slide the keys across

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:04,380
the table like have fun kiddo and you

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:07,200
know you're gonna go use this software

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,400
that might work for certain types of

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,440
software but that doesn't really work

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,230
for the platform and that's not the

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,210
pattern for really successful adopters

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,190
of the platform it's an immersive

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,570
experience so this kind of like going

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,250
from the black and white to the full

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,190
color sort of what we were going for

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,200
with this this part of the infographic

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,670
but getting out of the kind of the

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,880
tickets and the steps and the

00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:33,580
back-and-forth and and the means and the

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,620
you know daily interrupts etc and

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,530
letting the team that's actually going

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,200
to be the platform operators work in a

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,840
new way and that the the dojo experience

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,520
as part of that onboarding process is

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,470
really critical and I think of it

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,080
sometimes it's like you know if you've

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,580
done study abroad to learn a language

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,250
you know you went and you studied abroad

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,800
in Spain but you're on the phone with

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,540
your buddies back home speaking in

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,160
English assuming that you came from an

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,730
english-speaking country because I do

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,920
all right

00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:06,040
Californian speaking it's really similar

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,500
it's a good dialect you know you're

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,090
always like watching you know American

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,100
movies and talking to your buddies back

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,870
home like at the end of your or whatever

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,540
six months abroad like how much Spanish

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,930
did you learn right if you weren't

00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,940
really there so when you show up for

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,460
something like the dojo or you you you

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,920
whatever whatever it is that you do when

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,990
you're setting up the platform you want

00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,820
to give that team like that full

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,690
immersive experience you want to let

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,970
them have that space you

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,790
physically and temporarily from their

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,590
old jobs so that they can take on a new

00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,660
way of working and actually the the

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,150
panel that was here just before me is a

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,700
fantastic example of you know a lot of

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,410
that mindset that has to be adopted so

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:55,050
you got to let that team kind of take

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:57,430
that on and this is a quote from the the

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,860
interview we did with with Kevin and

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,650
Parker who you know operate that that

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,890
dojo practice at pivotal about kind of

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,470
that that idea of giving this gift for

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,330
sustaining change and that's really just

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,270
talking about that platform team that's

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,730
going to be a really critical part of

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:21,910
the overall success of adopting the

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:23,890
platform so then the the next secret was

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,300
something I noticed where the folks who

00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,420
were kind of talking through their

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,610
journey they often told the story

00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,880
through an application or they mentioned

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:37,870
a particular application in particular

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,370
like what was that first app and there's

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,580
a couple of different things within that

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,740
but the the idea of focus right when you

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,980
show up and you're gonna adopt something

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:51,190
like Cloud Foundry you can't just you

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,770
know paintbrush that on top of some

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,110
existing applications you really need to

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,480
know what are you gonna be moving on to

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:02,500
the platform what's gonna be that first

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,150
app and you know that provides start

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,510
know where you're gonna start that is

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,460
your your MVP really and that's part of

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,620
your adoption of the platform now it

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,480
could be a new app so there's some great

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,310
examples from already Liberty Mutual

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,740
where you know they were building net

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,140
new mobile apps for you know in this

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,450
case it was the Australian market

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,250
another example where they built it for

00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,110
the motorcycle insurance market you know

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,100
these were brand new greenfield

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,810
applications

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:34,120
great totally acceptable options another

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,370
example that I came across over the

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,900
course of last year was at orange at one

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,180
of the first applications they put on

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,430
the platform was a brand new mobile app

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,599
for their business to business market

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,120
right so they had a great opportunity

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,920
where you know they wanted to improve

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,440
customer satisfaction

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,000
they wanted to reduce some of the costs

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,889
you know for you know to their call

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,589
center in terms of support to their

00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:57,760
customers and you know especially down

00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,639
the road they wanted to be able to

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:05,230
create a new channel to cross-sell and

00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:07,449
upsell those customers and you know they

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,149
talked about in the the interview

00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:13,420
they're incredibly hard to read URL the

00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:16,120
bottom there's the podcast where you can

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,350
hear the full story you know they they

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,510
talk about how you know this would have

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,699
taken s 18 months but we were able to do

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:24,279
it in six months and it's a combination

00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:27,070
of you know adopting some of the the

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,470
pivotal labs methodologies as well as

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,240
having these services available back-end

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,290
services for the mobile app on the

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,570
platform and you know taking a you know

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,610
a more agile and iterative and feedback

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,060
and user driven approach to designing it

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,040
so and it's great that they got it out

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,889
fat earlier in six months rather than

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,839
eighteen months but what's also really

00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:51,639
interesting was that nine months into

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,160
the the availability of this new app

00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,890
they had really high adoption rate which

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,500
is the other sort of acid test for

00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,820
especially a mobile application so you

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,769
know just just to illustrate the point

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,360
that you know having focus and saying

00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,740
okay we want to we've got to start that

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,690
thing we want that first app to be

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,449
successful right because that's gonna

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,970
pave the way both you know from a

00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:14,829
technology perspective as well as from

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,980
an organizational perspective in terms

00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:20,529
of how do we justify this platform and

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,680
this approach to the rest of the

00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:26,500
organization into more development teams

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,880
now doesn't have to be a greenfield

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,760
application so there were some

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,560
interesting stories from t-mobile where

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,750
they were talking about how they had an

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,180
existing Java monolith with a thousand

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,250
Java functions those taking them seven

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,970
months and seventy-two steps to make a

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:45,069
change to that software so again they

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,470
engaged with pivotal working with both

00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:48,910
our app transformation teams and moving

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,949
it onto the platform and so they

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,310
actually rewrote that particular

00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:56,350
application and had a hundred percent of

00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,770
the production traffic on the platform

00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,510
within three months

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:02,270
and so they saw a lot of benefit from

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:04,640
from doing that they were able to have

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,410
you know no human intervention when they

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,350
needed to scale that application same

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,330
day bug fixes no downtime really just a

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,620
night and day experience from what they

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,320
had been dealing with with this

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:19,010
application so not a greenfield

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,840
application also really great focus that

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,430
they brought in terms of okay we're

00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,930
gonna stand some we're gonna stand the

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,820
platform up and we're gonna stand up an

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:29,480
application on it we're gonna go after

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,250
this really gnarly Java monolith that we

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,490
need to modernize anyways because it's

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:37,540
really getting in the way of us in our

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:40,400
ability to respond to the business and

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,250
then another sort of tippet within that

00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,900
concept of okay so you could use you

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,770
could be new it could be it could be

00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:52,670
existing was listening to comcast and

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:55,040
how they cited how they they focused on

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:58,340
bringing three applications that were

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,250
taking 40% of the traffic and so in that

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,330
kind of like mocked up pie chart example

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,160
right they didn't go for one of the

00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,490
little slices they went for these big

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,530
slices of the pie so I think of this as

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,590
like the needle movers mentality right

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:14,990
and so another way to approach coming

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:18,740
onto the platform is go for for

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,540
high-value services so in in their talk

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,930
this was actually Greg's talk from last

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:26,750
year he highlights how what worked well

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,520
looking back to 2015 was that they did

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,460
they went after those high-value

00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,980
services so the focus is the important

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:38,030
piece right you know you can't go into

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:40,070
it without a clear plan and agenda about

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,410
which applications are gonna move on and

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,880
then and within that there's a couple of

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:49,370
different things that that could look

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:51,650
like okay third secret furtive this is

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,570
like making the platform go viral with

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,930
developers it's a combination of

00:12:53,570 --> 00:13:00,440
morality

00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:03,070
the right word making a go viral right

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,750
in terms of just interests as well as

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,600
also making sure that those those

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,820
developers are properly enabled to

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,540
deploy onto the platform

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,420
and this is really where you know having

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:21,380
a structured and systematic enablement

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:24,470
approach to preparing developers to

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,030
understand building 12 factor

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,530
applications and and one thing I've kind

00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,630
of learned is that it's it's it's

00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,780
dangerous to go to your developers and

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:35,660
say so do you know what a 12 factor

00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:39,350
application is because it's kind of

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,270
instantly adversarial and they'll you

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,070
know if they don't then they'll kind of

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,760
like say something dodging and then

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:49,490
immediately go google it and or you know

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,870
maybe they do right the point is like

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,230
you haven't gained anything by that

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,720
confrontation what you do stand to gain

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,270
is providing a mechanism to just assume

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,740
everybody needs a little bit of exposure

00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,020
and enablement and training and an

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,890
opportunity to get that hello world

00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,300
experience really quickly and and then

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,640
to be able to go from there and

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,360
understand what what additional patterns

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,490
and resources they need so Garmin

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,980
actually took an approach of building

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,170
their own internal labs program where

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,330
different teams would rotate through on

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,070
these sort of four to six weeks

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,960
rotations and that would give those

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,050
teams an opportunity to be really

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,310
immersed in a different way of working

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,440
understand these different patterns and

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:37,120
paradigms and starting to push

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:41,510
applications to the platform t-mobile

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,130
offered monthly 101 classes at least as

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,890
what they described in their talk last

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:51,500
year and so this was a day-long class

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:53,600
where in the morning they were kind of

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,070
given the the lecture style instruction

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,570
on you know this is what twelve factor

00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,900
is this is you know microservices

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,570
architectures an API design you know

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,670
continuous integration pipelines and and

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,250
pushing to the platform and then in the

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,600
afternoon they had a lab environment

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,670
where they could get that hello world

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,250
experience right you know you if you

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,970
can't get to that dopamine hit in about

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,980
two hours

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,680
you're you're probably gonna start

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:22,190
getting frustrated so you know they

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,510
provided that space and enablement for

00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,519
developers to do that

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,670
and then they left those labs available

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,860
I think for about 90 days or so to allow

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:34,130
those teams to continue to experiment

00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,480
and gain more and more skills so that

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,610
when they show up and they're pushing

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,500
apps to the platform they're pushing

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,889
healthy apps to the platform that are

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,660
well designed to run there and then

00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:49,970
there there were some folks that you

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:51,410
know kind of alluded to like well we

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,100
didn't do any formal marketing of the

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:57,050
platform we just saw a nice adoption but

00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,910
if you if you kind of look at what

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,100
they're doing they're actually creating

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:04,490
an environment that's very hospitable to

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:07,670
developers so things like at Comcast

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,769
there's no tickets on the platform right

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,050
so one of the things that developers

00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,220
tend to get really annoyed with is when

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,130
they have to put in a ticket for

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,470
everything and so moving onto the

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:21,079
platform it's you know inherently a more

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,050
self-service environment and a lot of

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:25,339
the support is really provided through

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,170
in their cases that's it's a slack

00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,819
channel and they've seen you know really

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,940
healthy growth in the in a slack

00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:34,100
community that provides a lot of peer

00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,470
support and then the operations team is

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,560
there providing their support as well

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:42,279
and then Verizon had you know a really

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,560
funny anecdote in their talk about

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,839
similarly like kind of luring developers

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,100
in with the promise of faster

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,589
deployments and then hitting them with

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,149
the 12 factors so kind of this notion of

00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:55,069
figuring out what's going to be

00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,510
attractive to developers what are the

00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:59,149
things that are you know really

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,680
irritating and painful for them that if

00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:03,829
you're providing a different experience

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,360
they're gonna want to come and they're

00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:08,209
gonna want they'll be more willing to

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,850
invest to learn about what it takes to

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:14,449
deploy to the platform in a healthy way

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:17,150
and adhere to some of those structures

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:20,530
that you you get the payoff on the other

00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:23,209
side with a lot more speed and security

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:26,419
okay so the fourth secret we're now

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,160
breaking away from the infographic the

00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,600
fourth secret was kind of staring me in

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,210
the face but it took me a couple months

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,059
to like wake up and realize it it was

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,550
really around measurement and so what I

00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,410
mean by I was staring me in the face is

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,410
like I've been showing numbers this

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:44,530
whole time and you know especially at

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:46,420
the outset about like what makes what's

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,970
the measure of a successful Cloud

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,030
Foundry adopter so there's a couple

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,700
things as I started to noodle on

00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:57,190
measurement you know I was at the same

00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,160
time I was at a Gartner show a Gartner

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,960
conference in the fall and one of the

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,110
talks the the Gartner and also talking

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,210
about how you know a lot of these

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:10,600
executives right with all the like arm

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,250
wavy Big D Big T digital transformation

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,200
talk out there and by the way this is

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,980
arm wavy I don't know why it's not up

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,980
here it's just down here with all of

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,990
that and buzzword you know hype out

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,700
there there's an alarming number of

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,710
executives that have no digital business

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,690
metrics and and as you kind of listen to

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:32,560
their description of a digital business

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:36,760
metrics my my laywoman description is if

00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:39,310
you can tie it back to the P&L so an

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,640
example would be you know how much

00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:45,070
revenue is coming from a digital channel

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,140
or you know what percentage of cost or

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:51,790
what you know what dollar chunk of cost

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:55,480
is you know tied to this digital

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,620
self-service mechanism or something so

00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,930
they're you know you're when you're

00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,730
tying it to the PNL you know now you're

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,770
talking about a business metric so I'm

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,150
not gonna argue with with Gartner by any

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,390
means and I think there's a ton of

00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:10,420
validity in the notion of ya at a

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:15,550
certain point you need to have some sub

00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:17,110
digital business kpi's however I think

00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:20,320
you would be overlooking a lot of other

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:23,770
important measurement if everything had

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,240
to be tied back to the P&L so at the

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,480
same conference I was listening to

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:32,740
Adrian Koh Croft and he kind of spouted

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,860
off some you know brilliant thing as you

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,360
just want to do about you know how do

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,650
you go faster well you figure out how

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,450
many tickets and meetings it takes to

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,420
get something out publish that number

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:46,360
and make it go down I'm gonna spend like

00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:49,560
roughly the next three slides unpacking

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,780
what's in this pipi little statement

00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,610
because there's a lot of really good

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,920
stuff in there especially when you think

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,560
about the types of metrics that you need

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,600
to include that balance out those

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,030
digital business metrics right that

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,270
aren't tied to the P&L but are really

00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,890
important directional indicators right

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,550
how do you know I'm going in the right

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,730
direction

00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:14,130
I haven't yet launched that new app

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,350
that's contributing tens of millions of

00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,360
dollars in revenue right I'm not there

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,070
yet and I don't have direct

00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,810
line-of-sight into it because I'm trying

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,240
to take a more agile approach and I'm

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,030
gonna have to try things that fail right

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,420
so how do I know if I'm creating an

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:32,820
environment that will let me move faster

00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,280
right which is figure out how many

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,630
tickets and meetings it takes and make

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,640
the number go down right

00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,320
the fewer meetings and tickets it takes

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,550
to get something out the faster you're

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:47,540
going to be able to get stuff out so to

00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:50,190
that extent there's a certain element of

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,830
needing to kind of understand how ugly

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,390
you are today and so this is like you

00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,100
pour yourself a stiff drink and you look

00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,990
in the mirror and because it's Tuesday

00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,970
or whatever and you're like yeah this is

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,550
this is real right now this is what it

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,940
looks like so there's a process for this

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,530
that's actually been honed for I was

00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,180
going to say like generations but I

00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,160
think that might be overstating it it's

00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,860
been honed for decades in the

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,350
manufacturing industry that's tied to

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,690
lean manufacturing practices and its

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,700
value stream mapping and so this is

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,310
something that an a colleague of mine

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,220
published a really great paper you know

00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,110
short easyread that's all applied to

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,060
software development which i think is

00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,850
really helpful to keep it really

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:35,190
relevant for folks who are you know

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:38,040
working on this kind of stuff and I'm

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,350
just gonna zero in on one tiny piece if

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,840
you look at this whole kind of waterfall

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,120
picture that they have of all these

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,950
different groups and that the chunks of

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,900
time in terms of getting something done

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,610
right how many minute meetings and

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,560
tickets does it take and make the number

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,900
go down first you have to understand

00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,950
like yes what are all the stop steps in

00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:00,120
a process and you know you have to

00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,779
accurately measure what that looks like

00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,809
in your current organization

00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:08,989
and so one of those things where you can

00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:12,769
turn a dial and see something collapse

00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:14,449
and the number go down is in something

00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:16,219
you know developer self-service which

00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:18,229
folks here who are you looking at or

00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:21,649
using Cloud Foundry already know that

00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:24,379
that's that's a powerful aspect of the

00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:27,439
platform but just to illustrate you know

00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:29,029
what that means is - this is from quote

00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:30,979
from Andes it and you back when he was

00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:32,599
at all-state from a couple years ago

00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:34,759
where you know the wait time for a new

00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:38,329
environment goes from 90 days to 15

00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:39,769
minutes right so in the spirit of you

00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:41,989
know figure out how many meetings and

00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:44,269
tickets does it take to get something

00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:46,069
out well that's what how long does it

00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:48,169
take to get a new environment set up and

00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:50,629
there's a bunch of different steps along

00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:54,649
the way that need to be mapped and then

00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:56,719
each one dialed down now the second part

00:22:54,649 --> 00:23:00,859
of that pithy statement that Adrienne

00:22:56,719 --> 00:23:03,349
Koch Croft made was publish it and make

00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:05,329
the number go down right now the process

00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:07,729
of making the number go down is all the

00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:08,719
work that has to go in to actually set

00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:11,119
up an environment where there's

00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:12,679
self-service or if it's about collapsing

00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,689
the dev and QA then that's about

00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:15,949
adopting test-driven development and

00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:17,449
continuous integration they'll get to

00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:20,619
that that's secret number six don't

00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:23,419
worry we'll get there but publishing it

00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:26,329
is an interesting aspect of

00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:28,939
communication internally within an

00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:32,569
organization so when you think about

00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:35,599
those workplace safety campaigns that

00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:37,969
folks have in you know manufacturing so

00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:42,919
this is actually this is really meta

00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:45,859
it's a tweet from Dr Pepper Snapple the

00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,379
the bottling beverage and bottling

00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:49,939
company with a picture of their

00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:52,669
workplace if you I was like googling for

00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:54,169
pictures of workplace safety and you

00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:56,809
know you can see it's a hundred and

00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:59,389
thirty two days right everyone coming in

00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:03,229
sees that number and it's a it's a

00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:05,269
indisputable number it's not like what

00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:09,229
is their ROI on this thing how many

00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:11,689
people here can calculate an ROI right

00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:14,569
what discount rate do you use on your

00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:15,280
are wise eleven percent

00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:19,920
Oh

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:23,950
what do you use someone up back there

00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:26,290
Fed Bank rate okay who here doesn't know

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:30,070
what a discount rate is don't be shy

00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:31,960
right yeah yeah not only is it something

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,210
that like most people don't know what a

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,230
discount rate is in terms of calculating

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:40,510
the net present value of cash and and -

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,190
it's actually it's a number that you can

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,560
make a judgment call on you could take

00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,000
11 percent you could take bank rate you

00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,590
could be conservative you could take

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,640
Silicon Valley venture capital rates at

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:54,220
like 18 percent right why open up that

00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,430
debate right make it a super simple

00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:00,160
number that no one can poke at right the

00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:04,330
number of days since an accident it's a

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,800
it's a hard number right so you know the

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,210
number of days since something was

00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,310
deployed around you know just throwing

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,470
stuff out there where there's a as soon

00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:13,060
as it starts to be like a ratio and a

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,030
percentage or if there's some kind of

00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,710
extra decision that goes in there like

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,740
an it's too hard for people to

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,230
understand like in a in a snap judgment

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,910
sense so anyways this is super meta

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,440
because they're not only posting it and

00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,060
making sure that everyone internally in

00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,100
their organization who's walking in the

00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,290
door that day understands like this is

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,900
how we're doing are we doing well are we

00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,520
not doing well right and we all know

00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,700
that this is important because we look

00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,660
at this thing every day

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,890
there were actually signaling to the

00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,090
world that this is important because

00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,680
they're now tweeting it from their

00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:49,420
corporate handles so that's why I think

00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:50,920
it's super meta okay so then looking at

00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,180
some of those directional metrics just a

00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,280
little bit more of what some of these

00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,960
successful adopters have done this is

00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,730
you know bunch of metrics shared from

00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,260
Comcast and I'm actually not going to

00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,240
focus on the numbers that they're

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:04,960
sharing I want to focus on the

00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,690
categories that they've put these in

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,880
right as something to think about in

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,920
terms of you might need directional

00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,910
metrics whether you choose these or you

00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:18,880
choose other ones but these categories

00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:22,120
right the the notion of resiliency run

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,590
the business it's great to be able to

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,510
move things faster and that is an

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,480
important measure of success but if you

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,880
want to know if you're going in the

00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,560
Direction one of those things you need

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,600
to measure is are we getting out of the

00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:40,920
firefighting business so how resilient

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,650
your environment is is an indication of

00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,000
like yeah we're spending less time

00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:48,000
firefighting stuff which means we have

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,340
more capacity to innovate so that's just

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,520
it's important right

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,620
then there's the sexy time to market you

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,900
know speed and changing the business and

00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,160
doing new stuff and that was a lot of

00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,130
the metrics that I set up at the

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,230
beginning right and in my introduction

00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,480
and so there's a number of stuff there

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,100
also great right you know want to have

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,110
something in that category so

00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,270
understanding what are the categories of

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:15,840
metrics and then from there figure out

00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:18,720
simple easy to collect numbers that you

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,540
can constantly refer back to use those

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,130
to communicate internally how are we

00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:28,920
doing now I also wanted to call out CSA

00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,870
Insurance from Cal campuses talk at CF

00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,640
summit Basel last year this was the

00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,580
first time I saw someone talking about

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,870
patch frequency right so this is an

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,870
important another one of those

00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:42,480
categories of metrics which especially

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,610
like people are super squishy about any

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,520
kind of security measurement that like

00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,590
might anyone have to say affirm are we

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,030
more secure yet right people don't want

00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,150
to go there but this is something that

00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:56,190
you can't debate right like we used to

00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:59,760
patch this frequency and now we are

00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:02,910
patching at this frequency and so it's

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,150
it's neutral but it's indicative of a

00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,770
healthier more secure system and so if

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,880
that's one of your goals then that's

00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,470
something that you're gonna want to

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,180
measure to make sure it's going in the

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,550
right direction it also means you have

00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:17,160
to kind of know how ugly you are right

00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:19,080
now in terms of how frequently you're

00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,790
patching so you know get the stiff

00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,890
drinks ready I'll be right there with

00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:28,020
you all right fifth secret don't launch

00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,460
with the Avengers I tried really hard to

00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,980
figure out a way to word this that

00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,260
didn't have a negative in it but you'll

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,990
see why I couldn't get away from don't

00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,820
launch with the Avengers there's a

00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,470
couple things in here in terms of that

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,280
first team and in this case we're not

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,220
talking about

00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,110
the platform ops team that you know

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,940
secret number one was you got to give

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,430
them time and space and let them kind of

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,470
do study abroad even if it's all in your

00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,330
own four walls in this case we're kind

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:57,150
of thinking about that first app team

00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,980
that's going to be the first ones to

00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,540
move an app onto the platform whether

00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,060
it's new or whether it's being

00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:07,890
modernized that was secret number two if

00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:11,720
you recall the team is one that if they

00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:15,240
are a bunch of hero mentality and known

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:19,800
Rockstar personalities you are setting

00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:24,600
yourself up for people to negate the

00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:26,160
success right and you want to end up

00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,320
with a kind of joke here with like the

00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:31,170
office space crew it's like but you want

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,660
people that everyone can relate to when

00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,880
they succeed folks are in position to

00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:39,720
say oh well if they succeed then I can

00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:42,510
do it right when Tony Stark and his band

00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,790
of merry mostly men

00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:47,070
you know defeat the aliens it's like

00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:51,660
well sure like I could never do that

00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:55,320
I'm just door main like you know I don't

00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,280
have those skills or superpowers and you

00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,130
know Thor's hair

00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:02,790
therefore I probably could not defeat

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:04,620
the invading alien species and so you

00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,390
know that's the kind of the mentality

00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,460
that you got to get around this is all

00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,140
from a really great talk from John

00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,060
Osborne from the great American

00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,310
Insurance Company that he gave in in

00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,830
December but some other things in terms

00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:18,240
of you know this team that you're

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,070
putting together you want these

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,770
different experience levels you know

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,540
want folks that have been developers for

00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,790
twenty years you want some folks who are

00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,750
just at a school like what the folks are

00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,790
learning just out of school it's

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,430
different now right they actually they

00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:36,330
do bring an interesting perspective to

00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:38,730
the table different skill types later I

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,710
went back and did a podcast interview

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,800
with John and and Matt curry from

00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:46,680
Allstate and one of the things that John

00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:50,910
mentioned was like they planted a.net

00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:52,020
developer on a java project which kind

00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,330
of like that's

00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,550
crazy why would you do that and then he

00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,870
explained like well we wanted we knew we

00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:02,150
eventually needed to go modernize a

00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:05,640
bunch of dotnet applications also so we

00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:08,580
wanted to start to incubate the dotnet

00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:11,220
team with even from the from the get-go

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,930
right begin as you mean to go on so some

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,570
just really interesting ideas in terms

00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,370
of that first team and you know be

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,070
really thoughtful about the team that

00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,900
you assemble and avoid the the hero

00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:25,020
mentalities the idea that it's

00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:29,280
sustainable and a team that everyone can

00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:31,680
recognize themselves in okay number six

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,150
just checking on time I think I'm just

00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:37,110
about done I'm gonna have to go a little

00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:39,360
bit over I'll talk really fast secret

00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:41,370
number six you've heard about it at some

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,850
of the other talks and the keynotes as

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:46,770
well really embracing and investing in

00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:49,200
tests and released automation I'm kind

00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,300
of gonna harp on the investment kind of

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,220
analogy with this one

00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,410
the idea came from Matt curry from

00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,690
Allstate who talked about how he thinks

00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:59,640
of his test suite like his bank account

00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:01,500
and you don't get to park a million

00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,120
dollars on day one you got to put ten

00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,490
dollars a day and let the compound

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,670
interest do its thing right but you will

00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:11,370
get dividends on all those incremental

00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:13,530
investments the reality is people want

00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,970
an easy button when it comes to digital

00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,040
transformation but there is work that

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,080
has to be done you can automate a lot of

00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,090
stuff but you can't automate writing

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,850
tests you can automate the test

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,920
themselves and you should but you can't

00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,710
automate it right in the tests so

00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,020
there's this kind of equation if you

00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,610
will we talked about how deployment

00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,340
frequency is a is a really great

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:37,020
superpower when it comes to digital

00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,380
transformation it allows you to do the

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,640
course correction it's it you can sort

00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,820
of relate it to things even like you're

00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,260
patching frequency it's what helps you

00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,840
have that kind of iterative feedback

00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,640
loop from a product perspective great

00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,650
now how do you get there how do you get

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,690
those big numbers the 11-hundred deploys

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:57,660
per month the 3,000 deploys per month

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:59,280
right so it's a combination if you break

00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,010
it down while micro services well if you

00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,970
have more things to deploy right even if

00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,380
you're deploying at the same frequency

00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,600
the numbers gonna go up at the other end

00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,430
of that equation right so if you start

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,980
to decompose things and they get their

00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:14,290
own release cycle you could still be

00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:17,620
releasing each one of those incremental

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:19,420
services at the same once a quarter

00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,150
cycle and it's just going to be a bigger

00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,310
number so let's not ignore that on the

00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,380
other end self-service infrastructure

00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,360
that kind of goes back to that value

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,800
stream mapping example I gave of you

00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,500
know instead of waiting ninety days I

00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:35,230
get my self-service in fifteen minutes

00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,780
right when that happens folks can deploy

00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:39,600
a lot more frequently and then the one

00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,970
in the middle the automated pipelines

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,930
that's really that investment in test

00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:49,690
writing and test automation and so this

00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,220
is kind of something like that value

00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,960
stream mapping paper I think does a nice

00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,530
job of breaking down these different

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,870
categories where automating tests assume

00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:00,820
that you have tests and so if you don't

00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:04,150
have tests you need to start writing

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,830
them and there's been some great stuff

00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,150
written up by Matthew cane Parker

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:10,420
recently about why test-driven

00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:12,670
development I recommend it if you're not

00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,010
already familiar it's a great succinct

00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:17,110
piece to kind of frame up why that's so

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,960
important and then the the test

00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:23,320
automation continuous integration this

00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,060
is this is hugely important when you

00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,770
look at all these successful cloud

00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,260
foundry adopters they're all doing it

00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:33,250
right they're all automating their their

00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:35,410
tests and always having their code ready

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,630
to push to production now they might be

00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:39,130
using different tools to do that and

00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,540
that's fine the point is that you do

00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:42,520
something in that category and then

00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,730
visibility I think is also a really nice

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,070
aspect which is as things fail right in

00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:51,640
that test pipeline how do you quickly

00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:54,850
get the team aligned with the right

00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:57,160
context of like what failed and what do

00:34:54,850 --> 00:35:01,120
we need to go back and fix so that's all

00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,800
about collapsing that dev to QA process

00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,710
so that you end up with higher quality

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,960
code going out the door but you're

00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:12,120
minimizing the cognitive overhead every

00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:15,430
time a test fails for those developers

00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:19,280
ok seventh one forgive me

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:23,560
she's getting a little thirsty the

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:26,300
seventh and final secret is to be bold

00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,250
we we talked a little bit earlier how

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,280
Comcast specifically attributed some of

00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:34,600
their success to going after high-value

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,950
services and if you think about why

00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,510
higher value services the ones that are

00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,580
taking more traffic that have more

00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,680
things depending on them the process of

00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,330
working through modernizing those

00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,060
services means you're gonna touch and

00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,550
bump into a lot more potential problems

00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,990
as you work through those you actually

00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:55,070
pave the way to do the easier stuff

00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:57,320
later some other things that Neville

00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:00,440
George talks about also from Comcast

00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,150
but six months later that added into my

00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,340
understanding of this is there's the

00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:07,220
whole concept of selling this initiative

00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:09,710
internally within your organization and

00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,900
so by having those higher value services

00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,840
you inherently have more visible wins

00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,820
you don't have to go back and explain to

00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,950
every development team like well we move

00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,420
this one on this this service on to the

00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,640
platform they're like what service I've

00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,710
never heard of that like I don't use

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,630
that when it's something that's actually

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,550
like oh yeah that's that's a big one

00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,220
takes a lot of traffic like now you've

00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:33,500
got my attention so you get some

00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,390
additional benefit by being bold in

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,570
terms of going after those higher value

00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:42,680
services you can help pave the way for

00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:44,750
promotion later on down the road and

00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,060
then there's kind of more the top ten

00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,590
top-down mentality which I thought

00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,360
Liberty Mutual had a lot of interesting

00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:54,950
ideas that they actually kind of wrote a

00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:57,170
whole manifesto and John Hebburn

00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,760
was speaking at spring on platform last

00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,980
year was talking about yeah you've got

00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,480
to have this ambitious thinking and so

00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,490
some of the ambitious types of things

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,830
that they've put out there you know

00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:09,710
we're gonna modernize and we platform 10

00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:12,290
apps and 10 weeks right like let's just

00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:15,290
be bold about it in the process of doing

00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:18,410
that they developed the cookbooks to go

00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:22,280
and do a lot of reap lat forming because

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:23,960
they had this really focused a period of

00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,940
time when they just decided they're

00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,619
really going to tackle and understand

00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,890
what it

00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:31,630
to do that they also have I notice

00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,279
between their June talk and their

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:36,519
December talk they had two different

00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:39,490
senior leaders speaking and they had the

00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:42,519
same goals that they were pointing out

00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:44,700
coming back to you know measurements of

00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:49,170
success and making those really visible

00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:53,940
consistency is really helpful too okay

00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:56,019
so that's the seven secrets Quick Poll

00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,029
there's no way to do this cleanly I was

00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:02,109
gonna see what the most surprising the

00:37:58,029 --> 00:38:05,859
secret was for folks if anyone wants to

00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:09,519
volunteer not enough fingers so it's

00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:11,230
probably six or seven anyways since

00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,599
we're at a time I won't try to do that

00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:15,700
awkward social experiment there's a

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,359
number of resources in addition to the

00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:21,369
individual presentations and replays

00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:24,819
that are embedded links in my slides

00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:28,119
which are already on the summit pages

00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:29,680
I've written up some of these summaries

00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,630
like we're kind of all the the

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,869
background thinking that went into this

00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:36,039
presentation all came from and some of

00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:39,430
my colleagues have written some of these

00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:42,099
other papers that are useful and I my

00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:44,470
final plug is just a reminder that we've

00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:47,349
got spring one platform coming we have a

00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,609
special discount code and I effective

00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:51,029
tomorrow maybe I'm not sure maybe I'm

00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:53,739
not supposed to be talking about it yet

00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:56,410
but as we're celebrating our five year

00:38:53,739 --> 00:39:00,309
anniversary as a company we're offering

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:02,680
like an extra discount so go ahead and

00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:05,440
grab that code it's only good for like a

00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,509
week so you know birthday parties can't

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,579
last forever

00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:11,840
so take advantage and blow out some

00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:18,659
candles with us Thanks

00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:18,659
