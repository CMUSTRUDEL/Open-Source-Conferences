	First Line of Defense: Patching Vulnerable Java Application Dependencies in CF - Aner Mazur, Snyk

 What happens when a critical Java security vulnerability is detected in an application dependency, and upgrading is hard? How could you respond quickly without disrupting your development process and immediately shifting substantial resources to test a major upgrade?

This talk will analyze high-impact Java vulnerabilities, such as the Apache Struts vulnerability that was exploited in the May 2017 Equifax data breach. We'll show how to exploit them as an attacker would, discuss the various ways such a Java vulnerability could be addressed in the CF environment, as well as present an automated patch first, upgrade later approach.
