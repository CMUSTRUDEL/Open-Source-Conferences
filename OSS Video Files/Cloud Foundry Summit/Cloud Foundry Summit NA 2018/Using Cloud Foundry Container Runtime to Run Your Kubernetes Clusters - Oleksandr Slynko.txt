Description: 
	Using Cloud Foundry Container Runtime to Run Your Kubernetes Clusters - Oleksandr Slynko, Pivotal & Kaiting Chen, VMware

 Cloud Foundry Container Runtime (CFCR and formerly Kubo) is an OSS project developed jointly by Vmware, Pivotal and Google. It provides an uniform way to instantiate, deploy, and manage highly available vanilla Kubernetes clusters using BOSH - on GCE, vSphere, AWS, Openstack and Azure.

Using BOSH and CFCR to manage Kubernetes gives self healing, easily upgradeable clusters with managed secrets rotation. Cluster creation is simplified to the point where clusters can be created and destroyed for use in development or sandbox environments.

In this presentation, Oleksandr and Kaiting will demonstrate deployment across multiple IAASes, cluster healing, cluster upgrade and cluster creation.
