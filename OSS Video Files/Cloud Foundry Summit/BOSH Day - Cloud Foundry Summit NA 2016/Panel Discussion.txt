	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,340
why did we introduce ourselves starting

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:11,820
with Dimitri is it on alright

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,639
I'm Dimitri working at pivotal for a few

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:19,460
years and I'm currently a product

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,460
manager for Bosch yeah

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,849
my name is stormy Peters and I just

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,840
recently switched to leading developer

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,050
relations at the Cloud Foundry

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,540
foundation so all of you probably if

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,230
you're on CF devilís got a survey from

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,390

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,149
hello my name is Yan I work at sa P with

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:49,260
the OpenStack CPI currently replacing my

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:52,140
PM because he's gone hi Geoff Hobbs I am

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,879
the director of engineering for cloud

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,550
foundry efforts hewlett-packard

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,520
enterprise and it was the CTO at active

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,780
state responsible for staccato that

00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:06,110
Hewlett Packard Enterprise acquired last

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,850
year and hi I'm I'm doctor Nick and

00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,150
someone took my seat so I'm gonna stand

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,150
here

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,689
weasel awkward no not that seat like

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,799
that see you said my seat thank you very

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,119
much to the four of you coming along

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,310
f-for a day and I wanted just to warm up

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,200
and somewhat to introduce their role in

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,979
their perspective to the character

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,970
flashes out especially as we get to Jeff

00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:35,220
you know I wouldn't have agreed to this

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,930
panel if I'd watched um see first watch

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,009
me he'll be fine

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,540
give me fine question for Demetri and I

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,729
have to ask to meet you a question that

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,790
has no context to anything we've talked

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:52,140
about today since he was outside the

00:01:47,790 --> 00:02:01,890
entire time so Demetri in five years

00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:06,150
time describe what Bosch is like faster

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,950
probably probably everywhere so far at

00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:12,330
least it's been going well with the

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,530
customers and probably supporting you

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,930
know some of the features that you all

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,230
want you know no more it's more

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,709
importantly no more it that pretty much

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,820
covers it

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,250
so what we upgrade the version of

00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,620
Monnett between there and then that will

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,970
be in basta point out the 2.0 don't

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,230
start me on that all right Jeff on

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:42,420
the other end of the spectrum

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:44,160
why doesn't HP use Bosch so yes on the

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,040
short story of why you mean I'm the

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,860
anti-bush I've been in the Cloud Foundry

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,540
community since VMware open sourced it

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,820
in 2011 we did play with the initial

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,019
Bosch release when it was open sourced

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,510
in 2012 so it's it's a bit of a

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,670
philosophical perspective we believe in

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,310
Cloud Foundry the workload awesome

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,790
workload automation and other features

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:16,140
but we just want that to be a product in

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:20,100
customer hands we don't want to need an

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,720
army of consultants who have made some

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,130
great businesses doing a good job

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,870
beating Bosh into shape but you know

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,709
where we were a product company we are

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,590
still a product company in HPE and our

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,420
focus has cloud foundry not not how do

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,640
you get there but I just want cloud

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,880
foundry up working for my developers and

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,709
I want it up this week not in the two

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,530
weeks it's going to take for you to get

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,769
the manifests and everything working in

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:54,060
our network so that's the approach we've

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:56,010
taken you know vm based currently for

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,570
those who saw I have a question later on

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,989
he might helps you okay you can flesh

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:03,269
that thing container-based is what we're

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,150
working on a lot of some people may have

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:10,080
seen it represented earlier that's been

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:12,629
open sourced and our focus is basically

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,710
that cloud foundry is the product not

00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,900
Bosch and

00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,160
it's not an animosity towards Bosch as a

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,050
product but it's just too much

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,550
complexity for when you're just trying

00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:26,530
to deliver Cloud Foundry as a workload

00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:30,730
to the customer excellent thank you very

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:33,070
much and stormy I have to be honest

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,930
Colin puts you on that seat so I could

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,970
ask you this specific question

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,510
I just forgot I have to go do something

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,540
right this is this is the specific

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:49,290
question Colin gave me to ask you

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:51,460
stormy why isn't everyone using Bosh I

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,440
don't know why aren't they

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,840
I'll put that in context you are the

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,490
developer evangelist and an advocate for

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,850
a full cloud foundry and all of Bosh

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,570
I'll restate the question why isn't

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:07,000
everyone using the boss I believe

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,100
everyone will be using Bosh and I think

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,260
it will take everybody in this room and

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,210
many others outside of this room to make

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,070
that happen and when I think about it

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,420
from a building community perspective I

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,340
think there's two ways we have to build

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,010
the community one we have to make this

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,140
community the community of hardcore

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,600
users and developers and contributors

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,580
stronger so we need more technical talks

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,230
more people in the forums more people

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,360
becoming friends with each other

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,060
building this community and then we need

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,860
to reach more users and to do that we

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,290
need each of you to go out and speak

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,790
about Bosh so you need to go to places

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,980
where people aren't already Bosh fans

00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,890
and speak about it whether it's your

00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,410
local meetup it can be the API Meetup or

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,840
the paths meetup whether it's a

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,430
conference a technical conference that's

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,230
not a Cloud Foundry conference or not a

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,600
Bosh conference we need everybody in the

00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,840
room if each one of you gave one talk a

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,670
year and convinced one person to move to

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,040
Bosh like we would have the the pyramid

00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,220
network I like it's like at next chef

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,110
comp you put in a talk about shift like

00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,719
chef plus a song like that and when you

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:14,929
arrive you give a talk on Bosh

00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:20,539
that's what you're saying isn't it yeah

00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:23,599
you should also want to know any any

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:24,889
other IDs no I so you can be a little

00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,539
sneaky I heard that nobody ever reads

00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,339
abstracts except the people picking the

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,629
talks so as long as your title is

00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:31,669
reflective your audience won't be

00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:39,229
disappointed right so you lie about the

00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:41,199
topic and the speaker yeah advanced

00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:44,149
ideas I appreciate them

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,519
Yann said the summit story is being

00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:49,729
about multiclad OpenStack CPI product

00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:51,709
manager is Bosch and Cloud Foundry is it

00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:54,860
actually multi class yet or what what

00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:58,819
are we where we are with that sure we we

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:01,239
have actually a deployment on AWS and on

00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:04,339
OpenStack so we're using it multi cloud

00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:06,499
and can you give us a summary of where

00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,269
the other CPI's are at do you know Oh

00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:10,879
Demetri can please fill in you got a

00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:14,319
snail panel I mean sure I can fill in ah

00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,969
well vSphere one of the oldest CP is

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,279
actually probably before pivotal moved

00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:22,789
over to AWS we've been using vSphere for

00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:25,009
some production Cloud Foundry AWS that's

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:29,719
where Peter was running great place to

00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:32,659
run we now have you know a sure that's

00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:36,050
recently been published as a supported

00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:39,139
CP I believe a fewer customers already

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,779
running on either GC p is coming up

00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:44,419
Google has been working at it based on

00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:46,550
fridges work and that's also going to be

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,610
coming up probably within a month we'll

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,169
be at it we'll be adding it to both IO

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:55,869
then of course we have OpenStack so

00:07:51,169 --> 00:08:02,269
OpenStack has been one of the you know

00:07:55,869 --> 00:08:05,179
first and somewhat struggling but you

00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:06,679
know favorite CPI's given that it's we

00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:09,630
have to work with this a few guys and

00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:12,680
that's been always fun

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:17,940
Thank You Dimitri ah my bad my bad oh

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:20,970
yes that is the stink old software from

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,070
IBM they've been actually hard work at

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,600
it I believe they're gonna be publishing

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,800
or actually already published the CPI

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:31,860
the Bosch io stem cells coming up soon

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:36,810
yeah that's I guess that's the official

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:42,360
list today there's a photon photon

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:44,340
another platform from VMware very

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,680
similar to vSphere but has its own

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,420
advantages that's also coming up soon I

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,730
believe there's some painting emails

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:58,970
they have to read ok bare metal rock HD

00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:01,950
that's another CPI EMC worked on it so

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,650
you know we you know we wanted to

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:08,760
support something more outside of a

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:10,230
usual range of AI as is so Rock HD is a

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,660
software that allows you to provision

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,720
bare metal machines so that also works

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:19,050
actually surprisingly with OpenStack

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,080
stem cell currently I think that's it

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,620
and yeah anyone else make well well

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,450
we're on the list

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,750
so I know you actually sound like it's a

00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,340
laborious Li long list a year ago we

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,100
were struggling to maintain the three we

00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,110
had and you started the external CPI

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,090
work you know and that's all ballpark

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,940
how's that you know is it yeah I think

00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:42,000
that paid off uh we have you know Azure

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,350
and Google and SoftLayer wreckage DCP

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,020
eyes I don't think that would be pretty

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,500
much impossible to you know make them

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:52,290
you know be inside Bosch so

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,890
externalizing it paid out I think pretty

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,090
good dividends yeah alright question for

00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,760
everyone and we'll start with Jeff

00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:02,060
because he has an answer we took wash

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:07,070
away from everyone

00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,070
2016 how would you deploy cloud foundry

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:14,790
you pick up staccato and go so I missed

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,230
your interest so you said so you said

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,430
you open-sourced what you guys have been

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,840
using for the yeah it's presented it's

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,620
actually the next generation stuff that

00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:28,950
we open sourced and it's so the current

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,240
generation is is a VM deployment so you

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,220
have like the stem cell

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,870
everything's on it right you got all

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,270
your Cloud Foundry you you make a

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,030
hundred of them it it's not master slave

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:41,550
it's hive mind and and you go that's it

00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,620
it's it's VMs and you know honestly

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,170
going into a customer they already all

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:50,310
have their own ways in working with

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:52,260
virtual machines and and you simplify

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,000
that shim layer of what they need to

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,970
deal with whether it is going to be each

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,650
F ansible puppet si si

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,590
you know we people work with it in all

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,300
sorts of different ways all of the the

00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:06,450
Cloud Foundry essentially we're taking

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,180
all of the Bosh stuff and distilling it

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:11,130
to those few variables you need and I

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,710
think the the reasons for why we've

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,530
taken that approach and the work that

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:19,170
we've done was Matt representative

00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,570
perfectly well it's an insane amount of

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,210
complexity that you really don't want to

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,460
put in front of it of a customer and for

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,460
a consumer of what they want for Cloud

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,640
Foundry you can distill most of the

00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,800
Boche stuff into a few config variables

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:39,360
so why is that not the way that most

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,670
people pick it up and you know looking

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,670
forward and which was what was open

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:47,970
sourced Cloud Foundry as a workload

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,700
orchestration fits perfectly well into

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,740
just a series of containers and there

00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,230
are a lot of great container

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,350
orchestration frameworks which have come

00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,000
up and you know maybe Bosh will be more

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,570
ubiquitous in a few years

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,900
I love the vision of Bosh 2.0 but it's

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:10,710
not all there yet and again hey we're at

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,830
Bosh one point three one two zero yeah

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:18,960
I'm waiting for the six one eight zero

00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:20,460
the big yeah so so you you know what

00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,400
what you would then have is

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:26,310
is pretty much the future vision that

00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,310
was Prince ended by matt is actually how

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:31,710
we're already using Cloud Foundry as a

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,420
workload as that one step deploy and a

00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,680
few configure I'm frightened

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,500
I think you open still is does it work

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,920
yes and you know was there was a great

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,380
video of of that at the at the booth of

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,240
it showing running over a week as people

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:50,580
were as a chaos I was nervous to

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,770
approach the HPV numerous regions yawn

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,160
take Bosh away how you deploy cloud

00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,020
foundry

00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,510
well this short answer is you can't I

00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,730
have recent versions of the master and

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,620
develop branch on my machine and know

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,900
how to build and maintain it but the

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,880
somewhat longer answers that we would

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,310
have to come up with something else I

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,650
didn't know what we've no interest in in

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,230
doing that the conversation I mean they

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,990
want to know if would if you had if you

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,090
had to run Clara tomorrow all the cloud

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,400
controller repo is all the raw Diego

00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:23,460
repos and everything now with no boss

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,580
and no bush yeah probably we would come

00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,860
up with something right like we probably

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,870
will be building boss or looking at

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,420
containers maybe that is an approach if

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,980
you don't have boss but I mean we use

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,990
bars it's it's kind of the canonical

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,330
tool to deploy cloud foundry that it's

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,630
got a reason that you got it's gone by

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,130
that okay we have a problem it's open

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:48,780
sorry because you're working for Jeff

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:52,620
now and it's gone I should be clear we

00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:55,140
actually do use the Bosch manifest the

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,580
Bosch releases we use those artifacts

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,260
you take those nè please take those

00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,330
steal them in listen through the

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,270
pipeline so that they sort of disappear

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:06,960
from the from the customer perspective

00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:08,820
cool so my first response is the same

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,370
thing it's open source so you can't take

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,410
it away from me - no I it's gone it

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,230
could not steal our world source box

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:18,000
from me but my first computer science

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,070
professor in college told me that

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,200
everything is better the second time

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,910
it's written so if you took Bosh away

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,010
from me I wouldn't hold a Bosh technical

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,540
day I would invite all of you and we

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,650
would rewrite Bosh which would be a

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,650
little scary but we could do it

00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:38,440
but what what version would it have dude

00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:40,999
do we get to start with Russia

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,919
[Applause]

00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:45,299
um you got to start again from scratch

00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,369
I had to deploy cloud foundry what do

00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:49,319
you build well I didn't start it right

00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:56,069
can't take the credit but I took it away

00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:57,659
from you what do you do tomorrow how

00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:59,309
would you build like I mean take this

00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:03,329
conversation I don't know maybe maybe go

00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:08,609
to Hawaii relax a bit first panel people

00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:11,159
ever was questions I'd really you know

00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:13,829
like to everyone to consider that great

00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:15,419
Bosch is there you can use it it's it's

00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,249
very difficult they're trying to make it

00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:19,319
better but if you were to look at the

00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:26,549
system if you if your end goal is just

00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:28,409
Cloud Foundry why recreate a lot of the

00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,389
it's not you know necessarily boss you

00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:33,299
have to have the definition of your

00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:35,970
system somehow but there is then Bosch

00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:39,079
the actual tool deployment keeping

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:42,269
things up and running self-healing and

00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:45,119
and to be honest there are some great

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:48,239
other tools that have even though there

00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:48,869
are newer at least in name newer than

00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,720
Bosch

00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:54,509
you know kubernetes a great place to

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,839
place cloud foundry Bezos also another

00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:59,429
good one has a lot of the features that

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,829
if you've containerized cloud foundry

00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:05,519
use a cuban aids bas-reliefs to bring

00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:07,919
out kubernetes so average yeah so it

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,720
always goes back to you know my circle

00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,100
at what how you install kubernetes how

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,779
installed messes how do we update it

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,819
probably patch it the second day how do

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:20,689
you manage the rest of this starts with

00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:20,689
a vm install Ruby and then some tool

00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:31,989
sorry this is for Jeff

00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:40,359
sorry cuz someone say Maria's question

00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:44,009
leather Jeff so there there is there is

00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:47,679
day zero bootstrapping that we do and

00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:50,439
that's that that depends on your

00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:53,379
infrastructure so yes there is still a a

00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:56,769
shim layer there but it is relatively

00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:59,850
trivial compared to the the run time and

00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:02,919
the upgrades again its containers we use

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,699
docker we use docker images docker

00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:08,709
layers and that kind of stuff so we

00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:13,199
obviate some of the other more difficult

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:15,669
parts by using some of the existing

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,370
other open-source projects

00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:21,730
hey Demetri so in the five-year future

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:24,069
idea can you imagine that that the

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,100
individual did the processes jobs the

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:30,039
the the bits inside a VM being

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,600
containerized yeah absolutely so you

00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,950
know replacement of money for example

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,260
now there are all distributions

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,389
including Ubuntu have you know systemd

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,789
it's probably the next job supervisor

00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,710
that the agent is going to be using a

00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:48,820
system d sorry who's the one person room

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:50,710
that likes us to do so yeah that that

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,100
does most likely gonna be the next you

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,840
know replacement of money right and so

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,260
was that I guess you get some of the

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,370
other features and including that you

00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,970
know you can continue rise your

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:06,220
workloads you know and you know Bosch is

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,990
fairly generic right there's all this

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,909
abstractions about storage networking

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:15,760
volumes I don't have a you know public

00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:17,889
repo at this point but I've written a

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,070
docker CPI for example that you just use

00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:23,230
Bosh to deploy anything that Bosh can

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:26,320
deploy to docker containers so is that

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,870
CPR public it's not right now but you

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,130
know could open source that I guess

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,139
there are two versions of Dimitri's

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,340
github repo there's the public one and

00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:34,580
then there's the incremental things

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,150
where we shares them with you

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,830
[Music]

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,400
like yeah and it's the same one and I

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:47,400
looked at the other day it's too private

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,400
yeah separate subscription lists paid a

00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:52,990
little extra cash on the side from

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,179
pivotal I have to get to Hawaii somehow

00:18:52,990 --> 00:19:16,570
is there a question for the panel from

00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:18,100
the audience maybe I don't know I know I

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,960
don't think anyone any of our customers

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,559
is going to be paying for that see here

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,149
Bosch buildpack with mana inside it so

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,279
it can run jobs and I can't see how that

00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:29,260
couldn't work actually I did in one of

00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,899
the Star Command haven't done that

00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,850
sounds awesome

00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:35,140
ruben did something like that oh he was

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,080
running s right he was running Cloud

00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,890
Foundry he's running Bosch on Cloud

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,539
Foundry wasn't he

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:46,539
that's right for his dozer hey how much

00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:49,059
time we got one minute I'll ask my final

00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:53,289
question then and we'll start with mr.

00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:57,399
negative your next job would you use or

00:19:53,289 --> 00:20:00,250
advocate for the use of Bosch I would

00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:03,549
review it again as we do as we do do

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:06,789
every couple of years I like what I see

00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:09,360
in the 2.0 in the future but I want to

00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:11,470
see it actually hard code in my hands so

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,630
that would be by changing the version

00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:18,490
number there there's a little more to go

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,059
to to get to the level of simplicity

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,679
that's being promised yep yeah if it's

00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:25,720
about distributed system provisioning

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,029
yes I don't mean for running toasters or

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,309
anything we're in the same sort of for

00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:34,270
running your systems in it yeah sure I

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:35,559
would store me I would and the reason is

00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,820
all the people that are sitting in the

00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,620
room and all the people that are behind

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,820
bashed like when there's a community

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,340
behind something you know there's

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,960
something really they're not just

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,149
support and people willing to take it on

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,480
but like you believe in it and there's

00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,480
reasons

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:59,290
it makes sense I mean yeah everywhere

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:06,720
place but you get a bright I know

00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:06,720
