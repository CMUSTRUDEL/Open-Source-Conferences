hello um my name's Dan young I work at a

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,900
UK Cloud Foundry consultancy called

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,550
engineer better and I'm hoping in the

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,759
next five minutes you'll get an

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,160
appreciation of Bosch not just as a

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,680
operational tool but as a an abstraction

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,730
layer that can change the way we look at

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,220
public clouds particularly and watching

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,960
the talks today I noticed there was a

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,900
couple of points that set me up quite

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,969
nicely and the first was when Julian

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,860
Fisher was talking about his business

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,630
experience with having to desperately

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,969
get off OpenStack very quickly got

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,860
revenue generating service on OpenStack

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,090
cloud that he had to move to AWS and

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,530
he's able to do that he was up to lift

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,020
up his entire production platform and

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,539
drop it somewhere else and save part of

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,079
the business the other thing I noticed

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,789
today was Nick asked the panel and where

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,949
could Bosh go in five years and I'm

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,760
hoping to maybe explore some of that

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,100
question a bit further so the first

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,250
thing I asked is what makes Bosh special

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,770
and some would say it's the dubious

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,040
honor of being both simultaneously the

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,810
best and worst software in the world but

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,119
I think I think there's two other

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,140
reasons that it's special the first is

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,259
it's open source and the third reason is

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,869
it works just like this travel adapter

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,520
that I'm carrying on me that allows me

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,960
to move around the world unlike either

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,060
think about where I'm going to use my

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,189
laptop I just take it for granted that I

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,200
can take an electric appliance anywhere

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,460
plug it in again it's gonna work and I

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,220
have to take I don't think about that so

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,299
to sort of think about how we got to the

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,460
point where I can take that for granted

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,970
you have to think a bit about the work

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,250
of people like Simon Wardley so he's

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,350
basically been educating the world for

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,659
over a decade on commoditization and

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,000
commoditization of IT particularly and

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,950
how computing is basically evolving to a

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,719
state of being a utility service and you

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,590
can say that cloud computing is just a

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,060
marketing term for computer utility and

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,009
it's all driven by commodity size it's

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,899
all driven by competition so they may be

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,690
the only way to stop this process of

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,470
things evolving up that chain is to stop

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,650
competition

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,020
isn't going to happen and when so all IT

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,580
activities are sort of moving somewhere

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,740
along that line and when you throw

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,440
open-source into the mix it dramatically

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:30,030
accelerates the evolution to a higher

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,340
state now we've all been watching this

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,690
sort of one horse race for a long time

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,630
and we accept high costs going into AWS

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,950
and we just live with it be in

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,330
possession of boss you might be able to

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,330
see the world differently when new

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,700
competitors start to arrive and even in

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,190
a one horse race that one horse can

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,950
still have bad days and building

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,380
distributed systems of scale is hard

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,940
because you know people make mistakes

00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,800
and even when you can hire the best

00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,220
engineers in the world things still go

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,930
wrong

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,020
a cat will run across your keyboard and

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,890
set off some cascading failure things

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,360
will break and systems that op that the

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,910
suppliers operate in are themselves

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,560
fragile so you know there is no

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,600
institution on earth that is immune from

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,890
global political or economic events I

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,580
think we've learnt that from the banks

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,530
and if your supplier has one name it is

00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,390
effectively a single point of failure so

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,890
really I think we get to a point where

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,840
when Bosch is brought into this picture

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,090
we've got multiple hyperscale clouds and

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,190
we can feasibly use them we're imagining

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,320
them as modular building blocks as I as

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,610
building blocks and we don't just have

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,370
to lock ourselves into one of these

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:41,670
silos an open source is powering that

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,600
new multi cloud era so hopefully you'll

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,549
all get to start using Bosch CPI's and

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,690
contribute to them and hopefully we can

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:50,690
accelerate that a bit further

00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:56,090
