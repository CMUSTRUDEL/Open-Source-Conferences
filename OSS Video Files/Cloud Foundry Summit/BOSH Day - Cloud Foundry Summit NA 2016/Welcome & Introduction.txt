	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,570
good morning boss nation good morning

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:15,809
boss nation so three years ago I was not

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,090
here but the whole Cloud Foundry summit

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:22,859
was smaller than the people and sitting

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:25,230
in this room so think about that so this

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,810
is and it was a one-day event like the

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,699
one that you're about to do I actually

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,719
believe that Bosch may be bigger than

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,250
Cloud Foundry right so when you think

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,440
about when you think about platforms

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,309
right and all of us probably have

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,930
different ideas about platforms I always

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,230
think about the great example of Windows

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,809
and Office office obviously was a

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,410
application that people could use and it

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,460
drove a lot of Windows and that had a

00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,879
cyclical effect right it was a virtuous

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,129
cycle cloud foundry is really office

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,590
right it's an application that runs on

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,629
Bosch and I think almost nobody really

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,820
gets the power of Bosch this is the

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,619
platform for the data center this is the

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,150
platform for the internet we haven't

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,610
taken it as seriously as it needs to be

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,939
taken there are raving Bosh fans who

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,860
know almost nothing about Cloud Foundry

00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:18,570
there are cloud foundry fans who don't

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,159
use Bosh and I find that troubling

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,810
I'm sure you'll help us with that

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,150
problem so I invite you to have

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,259
optimistic day have a productive day

00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,759
think about the fact that you might be

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,350
running a 1,500 person three-day

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,470
conference three years from now or

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,290
sooner because Bosh is awesome it's

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,700
amazing and it's it's powering what

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,159
makes Cloud Foundry magical the

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,759
self-healing auto-scaling nature of the

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,829
platform with that said I want to

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,140
introduce the actual master of

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:53,189
ceremonies he wanted me to introduce him

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,890
as the tallest person in the community

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,450
but I think that picking on people's

00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,280
physical attributes is not appropriate

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,479
so instead I'm going to I'm going to

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,100
tell you what I think about Colin which

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,110
is I think he's the kindest person in

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,729
the community

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:11,470
he's he's it

00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:13,810
so he's Collins Collins got a huge heart

00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,290
and I think he's he's great proof that

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,090
doing the right thing every single day

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,069
adopting a giving mentality will produce

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,900
not just great results in your in your

00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:25,030
life and in your friendships but also in

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,430
your business he is now the CTO for

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:43,180
cloud at pivotal software please give it

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:48,489
up for our dear friends thank you so

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:50,620
much Sam I'm I'm British so that was a

00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,500
little bit strange but sir thank you

very much a huge welcome to all of you

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,810
thank you so much for coming along so

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,880
firstly I want to say and I'll say it

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,799
another day as well such a huge thank

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,110
you to the real star of this show which

00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:09,090
is Paula Kennedy we sat here it was

00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,090
organized everything the whole thing

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,610
said my input into Bosch day was saying

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,880
to Paula

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,160
Bosch day mm-hmm and everything else has

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,980
happened after that so huge huge thanks

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,970
to Porter I also want to say a huge

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,980
thanks to our sponsors you can see here

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,720
this would not have happened without

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,840
them because I wasn't going to pay for

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,820
it and somebody had C so let's just go

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,070
through these this is me I work at

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:49,180
pivotal today's agenda looks a bit like

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:52,630
this we've got some fantastic speakers

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:56,620
lots of technical content about Bosh

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,670
we've got lightning talks and I hope the

00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,890
Lightning talk speakers are going to

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,600
obey the five-minute rule unlike some of

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,550
the speakers at the unconference who

00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,440
decided five minutes equates to about 14

00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:13,420
minutes I'm looking at dr. Nick where

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:15,730
are you like this the space-time

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,709
continuum you know as Ben's in it I

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:24,550
think it took a very large turn where

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:26,350
dr. Nick was talking there so I'm amazed

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,780
this has happened I can remember first

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:32,800
using Bosh which would have been back in

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:36,310
at the 2012 when it was released and I

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,380
found it impossible to use really really

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,260
difficult to use and then I finally got

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,440
it to work and it was this Eureka moment

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,360
and I've never looked back

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,360
so today's Bosch day is a bit of an

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,680
experiment to see whether or not the

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,350
community want to have this kind of

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,350
event and obviously from the turnout

00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:59,140
we've got so this event sold out people

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:02,080
are very interested in Bosch so what I

00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:05,200
ask of you each of you is when people

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,479
ask you about Bosch that you evangelize

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,340
it that you're all ambassadors for Bosch

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,340
and you tell them just how great it is

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:20,260
we all laugh wash so this is the agenda

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:24,040
for today as I said thank you so much to

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:27,040
all the speakers the Wi-Fi in case you

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,090
wanted to know is the same as the summit

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,300
so if you've been here for the summit

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,040
you've got the same Wi-Fi access and I

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,630
have nothing really more to say other

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,100
than that it's going to be an amazing

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:43,360
day thank you all so much for coming I'm

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:45,020
going to hand over to the amazing dr.

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,059
