	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,919
so I thank you very much um so I

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:10,700
I love bush and so when poor and and

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,080
colon asked me if I'd like to share at

00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,299
Paula said this was my talk title which

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,600
is great because you know I

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:23,240
yeah we've all had the happy days with

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,099
the Bosch and the sad days and you know

00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,960
so when I say I love Bosch it's the same

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:34,230
as in the same way I love my children

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:38,160
you have the good days and then you have

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,510
the other six days of the week and which

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,629
is why you should have more than two

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,250
children I have three children which and

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,809
my children have started to hear me say

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,090
this next phrase and start to question

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:54,930
it and I always joke that I actually

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:56,820
have two children plus one for spares so

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,719
hopefully they don't say I've got one

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:05,339
parent and one for spares that that's

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,930
going to turn out badly so so whilst to

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,850
come to that place is to really I

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,979
thought we in the sense that everyone

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,670
else is going to share the ongoing story

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,799
of Bosch I would tell the story that led

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,170
to loving by sure because I don't think

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,930
if you if you worked at McDonald's and

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,750
found Bosch there's not much in it for

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,880
you so there's probably a lot of context

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,500
and a lot of even you know the pain that

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,210
you've gone through in your life to find

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,009
Bosch and go oh my god that solves that

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,729
problem that problem that problem this

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,710
is the best thing ever and so perhaps we

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,110
when we ask the question why don't more

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,610
people like Bosch my gut feeling is not

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,399
enough people have actually experienced

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,590
real production pain and then had

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,470
thoughts about why why their life is so

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,390
terrible - then - then see what Bosch

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,290
does so I'll tell the story of where I

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,490
came from and to put a little context

00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,290
across our customers last year I

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,000
estimate we have about 50 different

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,200
things running on on a bunch of

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
different boxes there may be a bigger

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,719
number than that a lot of those are

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,610
running under pipelines and that and and

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,099
relatively stable II and I really think

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,880
that that Bosch is allowed in addition

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,530
to concourse is allowed

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,060
I don't have a cool Bosch t-shirt on me

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,450
so I'll go with the Concours t-shirt

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,670
because they tell a similar story of

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,710
deterministic awesomeness but so it's

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,380
really you know we're moving forward

00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,820
really well in terms of not ask so much

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,010
it's the customers the things that are

00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,020
happening you just can move forward so

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,960
fast when you've got a good rock solid

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,970
platform um but to tell story I think

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,060
we'll go back in time which now I get to

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,680
use my keynote skills all right watch

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,210
this oh yeah

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,530
look at that that's cool as long as you

00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,240
have low ambitions for what you'd like

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:55,870
to achieve with keynote you can pretty

00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:59,530
much do them April 2012 I was when Bosch

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,750
was was publicly announced and and I

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,130
happened to be at the event when it was

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,200
happened now you don't just happen to be

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,050
at VMware for the day that's something

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,900
that you want to see arrive arrives you

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:14,230
have to know about it in advance and so

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,270
yes I was lucky in that I knew people at

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,500
VMware who were telling me this stuff

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:23,200
was coming out so we'll go back further

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,750
2010 I joined a company called Engine

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,270
Yard who were one of the first companies

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,850
who took the name paths and said this is

00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,940
what we are which is great because I

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:36,010
called us a hosting company which wasn't

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:41,440
very cool so platform the service much

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:43,660
cooler name and but but in a way you

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,730
know my little my short duration at

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,020
Engine Yard short relative the entire

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,480
length of engineer didn't enter our

00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,709
entire profession doesn't really add

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,660
anything it's respectful so we'll go

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,390
back a little bit further all right so

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,150
Engine Yard was created in 2006 and I

00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,450
think it's story is an interesting story

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,459
that leads to why Bush and I always

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,320
really enjoyed the when I came later in

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,970
in Gina's life I enjoyed trying to

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,030
uncover the history yeah a lot of

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:12,250
organizations have amnesia

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:15,280
it's not just companies but you know

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,170
governments have amnesia we all have it

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,000
so it's interesting sometimes to go back

00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,090
and hopefully we learn why we did things

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,360
and doesn't sometimes mean you get to

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,530
fix them but you can like okay now I

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,950
know why we have gin to

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,480
sorry engineer in in even you know

00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,180
probably many of its products now

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:38,950
Kevin's that right was still cloud and

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:41,919
and Jen to Estill and most cool kids

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,419
today would not be touching Jen - there

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,160
aren't barge poles long enough

00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:49,720
no one has barges it's really hard to

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:53,500
get the right tools to poked into but in

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:57,220
2006 it was chosen because it was the

00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,640
only oh s platform or distros

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,460
environment where we could do we could

00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,100
create the VPS Azure slices in a

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,080
sixty-fifth 64-bit environment and some

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,010
of them new gen - because their lacus

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,960
thing you know they'd played with

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:14,320
they've built their own thing and so we

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,150
picked in - you might think like an

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,600
we'll pick it today and we'll change our

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:24,520
mind tomorrow some of these things you

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,320
can never undo and you know you get some

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,880
skills you've got the people is that

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,710
really worth I mean I think in the two

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,360
years I was at engineered every six

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,919
months we would have the why haven't we

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,830
switched to a bunch of conversation

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,240
because that would make us cool and a

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,100
bar yeah but then we'd be pulling down

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,200
arbitrary packages and would be own our

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,530
own packages and it's it's a really hard

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,150
conversation because what we'll go

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,300
through it so so what did we get out of

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,530
Gen 2 so one things we could do if

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,640
you've done this isn't Parker's actually

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,580
many of you who's ever used Gen to look

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,350
at all the pain that you've wrought seen

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,560
you here with me on this story so so

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,460
James who is wonderful in the sense once

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,780
you start to understand what you're

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,180
really trying to achieve with a with

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,130
with a stable production system that

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,460
your company wants to run on top of is

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:15,130
you get to build things from source so

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,479
that means you can wiggle the flags you

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,130
can you know you can use this specific

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,600
source you want to use you can build the

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,450
specific content dependencies you want

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,880
to use there is a coral either that

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:27,669
which we discovered in in the history of

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:33,940
it Engine Yard was what happens when the

00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:35,919
source disappears so I heard about this

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,050
in in in but this is a very exciting

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,930
story yes so what happens when one of

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,330
your packages cannot be built anymore so

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,660
anyway obviously there's their solutions

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:49,330
to this but packaging script is just a

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,280
bash script I mean I wish it was just a

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,620
bash script it turns out that it's

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,000
actually a bash script but there are

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,640
magical Wizarding rules that you must

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,500
follow in order to be a correct you know

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,120
II build and so when I found boys just

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,010
like oh my god I can build my own

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,350
packages and no one's gonna tell me I'm

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:13,480
a bad human being and then ginger has

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,800
the system for taking you know you can

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,030
build the binaries and that they can be

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,530
built so you're not building sauce on

00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,750
the machines you have your binaries and

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,240
but in its essence you get to curate

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,330
your own district so let's have a look

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,180
what Bosh does Bosh builds packages from

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,680
source it has a packing restrictive

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,480
packaging script and bash we get

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,940
compiled binaries that are available to

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,540
us and and you might not afford this way

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,340
but every boss release is the distro

00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:43,420
it's a distro for variable one very

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:45,750
specific thing and and I became very

00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,550
much a fan of this idea that yeah I mean

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,220
you don't get the reuse inherently of

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,770
one package for many reasons which is

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,690
what a standard destroys for but you

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,060
know what I don't want that I want I

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:01,690
want a Ruby for this specific job of

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,970
running see if containers broker but is

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,220
part of docker Bosh release I want

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,750
another Ruby that might be exactly the

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,970
same or it might not but I want it

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,030
specifically described to run the Clark

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,130
controller and I'd rather solve the

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,830
problem of managing those packages

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,110
horizontally than the worry of if I

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,840
touch this one here that's shared across

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:26,920
50 different Bosh releases what's the

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,990
outcome and so fundamentally they have a

00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,080
very similar role in the packaging so

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,060
that was really interesting in the

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,060
history of Evangeline out we were the

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,710
one of the first people that so Ezra who

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,370
was one of the founders of Engine Yard

00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:43,450
met Adam from ops code and both of them

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,330
were very excited about this thing

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,010
called chef and Adam was writing chef

00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,090
Ezra was using it and I think we were

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,010
one of the first companies to report

00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,960
into production this is great I've got

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,550
Dennis here Dennis and Kevin are gonna

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,450
keep me on track for the

00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:00,700
for the history of engine yard and and

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,300
so one of the first sort of releases of

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,040
Chef was zero six zero one I've no idea

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,450
why so early there were with four bullet

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,580
points but and by the time I arrived and

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:17,410
by the time I left the version we were

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:20,020
at was oh six oh one what had happened

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:23,860
was was we had because we were

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:27,670
innovating you know sort of fought

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,560
universe - ops code itself helps code

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,480
wanted to go with a chef server model

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,880
where you know you describe it and pull

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,800
it down we wanted our own model of we

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,210
would control the chef repos and we

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,060
would you know we had a different thing

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:42,010
called chef solo and so a lot of the

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,500
innovation around how this all worked

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:47,440
and then the community grew separately

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,880
and in essence we were competitors with

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,250
ops code who are now chef and so one of

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,820
the things we did differently that we

00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,250
never unwound was we had two chef Ron's

00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,830
so we ran our chef right that set up

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,240
nginx and and the app dolvett's install

00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,370
all the packages and everything and and

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,890
you have a perfectly designed cluster of

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,160
machines and then we said now you can

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,720
run some chef and you would you know you

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,800
could provide your own bespoke chef and

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,150
people did all sorts of interesting

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,460
things from Redis and other systems

00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,890
there would be competition for certain

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,720
files as they would want their ideas

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,820
nginx being one of them

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,390
the configuration for makes it cooler

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:34,270
and so the problem was that we lost the

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:37,150
ability to easily move our platform

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,290
forward with confidence there were a lot

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,390
of it was a lot of heartache every

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,410
conversation around curating the cloud

00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,050
cookbooks that's what they were called

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:47,170
was was was fraught with this well we

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,940
have a customer who did this once this

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,800
is a terrible place to have have an

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,650
experience of trying to move a platform

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,910
forward but another one was we literally

00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,670
really couldn't move cheff forward

00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,020
either because to what and now how many

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,190
are we going to do this every week and

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,110
now do we need to let customers know

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,180
that Chef has changed in some way and

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,930
their cookbooks running it was a

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,520
nightmare and and like many things

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,690
if it's just a bit too hard you just

00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,110
don't do it today do that 365 days a

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,340
year

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,840
for five years and you get that everyone

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,750
feels bad about it that no one really

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:26,020
has the job to fix it in this so let's

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,370
have a look like chef did for us and my

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,470
gut feeling is just what chef does for

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,720
everyone you install some packages I

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,730
mean it's in Ruby what's cool about chef

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,410
it at a glance is that you get these two

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,080
runs through it you get to write it in

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,680
Ruby a programming language and you can

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:44,440
write you know high-level functionality

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,930
in their vote but this is pretty much

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,760
all we ever did I think this is what

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,100
people your chef for we install software

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,630
packages which were built either by

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,690
people we don't know or some other

00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:58,570
system that we did control so we were

00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,670
installing our Gen 2 packages you create

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,350
configuration files and chef has two

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,660
ways to do that there is the file

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:08,590
command and then there's the template

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:10,390
command I don't know why like they could

00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:14,080
just have one the template command which

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:16,540
might do template one of those types of

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,930
files might be a wrapper for Monnett so

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:23,830
we use mono coincidentally and then you

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:28,240
tell mana to start monitoring because

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:30,490
that's this job and so it turns out if

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,950
we look what Bosh does it installs

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,330
packages it creates config files we

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,120
install monitor scripts and then we

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,710
start monitor and so when people ask me

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,500
why don't we you know why not chefs like

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,090
what else do you want like what what is

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,400
that thing that you can't do with you

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,200
know if you look at what you using chef

00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,420
for let's get rid of all of Chef and

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,060
just describe the packages in a list

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,820
just have like a folder full of template

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,950
files and process them all with the same

00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,390
inputs so with chef you would sort of

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,130
say here are my inputs for this one here

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,560
my inputs this one let's just throw all

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,210
the inputs into all files and let's just

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,540
default him on it like in chef you can

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,520
pick different process monitoring and so

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,170
to my mind there convergent's down to a

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,370
very simple way of doing config

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:17,710
management was one of the things I liked

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:19,600
about Bosh all right so engineer we were

00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,350
a ruby company we sort of grew on the

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,420
back of the growth of Ruby

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:31,490
we made ruby applications specifically

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:35,330
Ruby on Rails easy to do and and so we a

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,740
chef was written in Ruby and so on when

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,870
you brought up a machine as a customer

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,670
like yeah we we brought the machines up

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,740
for you and then we ran chef but you

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:46,250
needed Ruby so we had Ruby on there to

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:53,300
run that the problem we had was that

00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:55,690
when we started there was Ruby 186 and

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:59,840
that's what the noise it used to make

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:05,840
that was provisioning they all had a

00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:08,270
ringtone so chef was running on on Ruby

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,190
and and our customers applications were

00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:14,870
running on Ruby and you got it on the

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:17,540
same Ruby like the same package you know

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,300
as you would apt-get install he select

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,960
and and then a new version of Ruby came

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:30,140
out some of our customers wanted to use

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:32,660
it and some didn't and so this was a

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,520
tortured process of untangling this and

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,470
providing the option for we ended up

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,560
having we had to have our own Ruby for

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,790
our Chef stuff and then in a hole and we

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,980
basically fork that whole thing and

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,930
isolated it and said this is us for the

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,820
chef called resin and then there was the

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,470
option to pick rubies and you know it

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,330
was that was the learning lessons over

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,000
time but they'd you know you can imagine

00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,500
the cost and then the Rd cost in the

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,960
meeting cost and the customer

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,180
dissatisfaction and you know why are you

00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,450
taking so long to do the simple job of

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,450
offering us 187 we had a similar problem

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:09,710
where we went from one amazon region I

00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:12,560
will get Amazon goes to the point where

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,630
we're you know the Ruby maintained is

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,240
want to move the hell on I just wanted

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,340
to play with shiny new Ruby well we were

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,750
destroyed company really you know you

00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,640
know in a sense like you as a new

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,120
company you still sort of mentally map

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,160
yourself to legacy or existing

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,320
industries and so we like that we will

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,690
like Red Hat except we managed running

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,360
systems so we managed packaging we took

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,890
it very seriously

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,240
we had some people that took you know

00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,399
package and security maintenance very

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,380
seriously and one of the things because

00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,930
we still had customers on 186 and we did

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,510
for five years took us a long time to

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:54,490
get them off was we maintained security

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:56,350
for that so along the path of engine

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,260
yard came and so we were running our own

00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,230
service in fact in the early days that

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:05,079
was one of the engineered sort of

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:07,089
conference this way it ways to turn up

00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,040
for conferences to come in with their

00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:10,649
servers and say look at our servers

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,480
these are awesome

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,940
that's right they did that in there they

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,209
were very excited by the service that's

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,440
2007 you have to stop doing that after a

00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:24,279
while because obviously that involves

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,149
downtime sorry your apps not running

00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:30,670
we're taking the service at the

00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:32,410
conference and we had all our own you

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,810
know somewhat bespoke code whatever for

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,709
bringing up slices and things and Amazon

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,890
came out around the same time the chef

00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:43,449
was was was was coming around and but

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:50,529
Amazon Web Services didn't look like

00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:53,790
this back then it looked like that very

00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:56,529
benign this looks helpful doesn't it

00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:59,110
like you would build an entire business

00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,220
on that thinking nothing could possibly

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,199
go wrong

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:06,730
and but and so yeah we had the we had

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,620
the challenge of having the build an

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,240
entire platform from scratch like so at

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,919
this point we we were now be a bigger

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,870
company we had more funding and so we

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,610
could do a bigger investment instead of

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,230
little scrappy little shell scripts that

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,150
no one saw we now start to build a

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,150
customer facing portal that would

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,829
provision clusters run chef and your app

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,209
would come up and all that and billing

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:26,230
and all that other stuff that you just

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,620
have to do in order to be in business

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:33,130
and and just to go back I mean as over

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:35,710
time Amazon became a machine and a very

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,970
big public presence and new things would

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,360
come out and our customers would say

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:43,650
well why can't I use the EO B's it's

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,090
like well you don't really need them

00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,670
we've got you know we're using H a proxy

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,800
haven machine what exactly do you

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:53,340
Obie's for us like alright why can't I

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,690
use I AMS like God's sake alright we

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,320
build everything before they had that

00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:02,220
stuff we don't need it so staying

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,830
staying with Amazon you know and

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,790
essentially competing with them and and

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,690
and so I guess we were one of the first

00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,820
organization the world to realize that

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:15,660
that how days were going to be

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,040
challenged by our very own vendor hence

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,560
we have this this whole multi-cloud

00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:25,680
premise here not just because the amazon

00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:26,940
but mostly because of amazon so there

00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,370
and so we built this thing called a

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,190
cloud and tens of millions of dollars

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:36,150
really would have been spent perhaps

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:38,400
perhaps even more than that so over

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,310
years right and when they built this

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,890
there was only one cloud and only one

00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:47,190
API to build it against so the idea of

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:49,200
building for multi cloud wasn't really a

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,690
concept you had no idea of what the

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,760
abstractions might be even if and then

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,370
then there's the you know engine yard

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,880
engineers had this idea of agile

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,840
development only build what you need and

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,940
unfortunately that idea of only build

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,150
what you need often means let's not

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,130
worry about abstractions today or

00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,900
tomorrow all right there's a number of

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:14,100
very angry internet people here and and

00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,010
and it's really hard to add them in

00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,120
later on sometimes and it's hard to plan

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,010
them in advance so it's a hard problem

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,560
in general I mean one of the ones we

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,660
missed was and isn't this hard not

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,640
really visualized there but was then

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,630
they came out with the second region for

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,560
my Lord oh wow that was a surprise did

00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,430
not see that coming you know he's man

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,680
you know you had

00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,180
we were deploying to Amazon that was it

00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,290
we were deploying to Amazon and then

00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,460
they said there's this other one what

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,020
what does that mean what do you mean

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,230
there's another one we were we were

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,520
doing this and now you've got that and

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,620
so yeah the effort that goes into

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,000
orchestrating an annex you're adding

00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:56,730
another axis to things so in essence we

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,980
you know this was our the the thing we

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,450
did you know we did package management

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,180
config management

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,650
to management that's what we did the

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,250
value proposition was was always

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:10,380
nebulous not nebulous not the right word

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,240
the value that customers saw didn't

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,400
always manage you know they we would

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,760
still have to have this do-it-yourself

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:21,390
yeah out sorry how I put it we suspected

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,040
our main competitor wasn't Heroku it was

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,590
people who said but I could do this

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,830
myself like why don't why am I paying

00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:31,020
you extra like like they saw the value

00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,550
of Amazon because you know

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,410
infrastructure people need to be paid

00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,410
but exactly what are you doing it's like

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:48,500
we didn't have emoji back then so you

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,500
could put that in support tickets but

00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:56,930
and so you know you all our code bases

00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:01,110
get a little old glue weary and and

00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:05,670
hammered all the time whether doing

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:14,430
break for time doing fine that doesn't

00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:16,200
want to come up next and it's okay so

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,640
you kogas little weary and you know you

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,170
the company starts to want to be

00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,550
multi-cloud you know Claire was

00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:24,390
CloudStack there was these other things

00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:26,310
coming along and OpenStack and but our

00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,840
code was nowhere ready for that and we

00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,610
had different ideas we weren't really a

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,400
container company even back then you

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:37,230
know Cloud Foundry had come out by about

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,330
now so we're in 2011 2012 we weren't the

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:44,790
next phase wasn't going to be containers

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:47,010
in any shape and but they wanted to redo

00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:50,400
everything you know they were open to

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:53,700
redoing the entire product to open up to

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,020
other ideas that we'd learned and so as

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,400
at this time I discovered I was I

00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,820
started to know through Twitter our

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,460
enemies at VMware but there were funny

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,210
enemies in a sense James Waters was

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,490
hilarious we would banter and he was

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,509
funny I knew Dave McCrory his good

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,729
friend

00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:17,489
he ended up you know taking Cloud

00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:19,320
Foundry to warning music and but it was

00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:20,879
Dave that that had telling me quietly

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,709
there was this this thing that's gonna

00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:24,749
be cool it was Bosch and it was it was

00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:26,099
how come you know Clara founder you come

00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:30,119
out in the first year with slim chef

00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:32,759
recipes and and very irregular updates

00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,559
but they worked and people happy but

00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,879
they weren't what VMware was using and

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,320
that pissed people off and it would

00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:38,999
cause the problems and so they they

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,079
brought up bison and this is what made

00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:44,279
me fall in love with the Cloud Foundry

00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:47,159
project as a as a mission like because

00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,649
can you trust VMware don't know but they

00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:52,229
just shared how they run this thing and

00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:55,440
that was pretty pretty powerful to me

00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:56,699
and but I still had an Janardan and

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,259
still worried about engineering problems

00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,699
and here is a system that just came out

00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:05,429
that was completely open sourced and

00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:08,399
solved 80% of what we found hard and so

00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:09,929
to crickets I asked does anyone want to

00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:12,179
come down to VMware with me to

00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:14,309
investigate to crickets I brought it

00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:19,109
back to engine yard and unfortunately

00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:20,119
Trudeau you know I was a junior

00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:24,239
executive

00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:26,849
I misbehaved and I wasn't I didn't have

00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:30,209
a lot of political capital about that

00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:32,669
time no one listened to a word I said

00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:34,799
and so I became the world's number one

00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:39,329
bosch evangelist but no one engineered

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:41,249
gave two shits and that was hard you

00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:43,379
know I could build demos of things in a

00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:44,940
week and they were still discussing what

00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:47,669
they might like to build for their v2

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,149
and it was it was becoming confusing

00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:52,499
internally why is Nick making this stuff

00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:55,709
that's not what we're doing

00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:57,989
I built an API you know in a way little

00:23:55,709 --> 00:24:00,690
ruby thing as I said like yeah post API

00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:03,359
and you'd send a request and it would

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,570
talk to Bosh because Bosh has an API you

00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,359
all know that right

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:12,139
it's not private and secret internal

00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:14,320
that Dimitri says that he's lying as did

00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:17,239
every product manager like Matt ever

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,830
they lied and said there's no is private

00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:21,249
don't use it no it's awesome and it's

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,450
fabulous and you should talk to it and

00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:25,929
it's really stable because no one

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,929
touches it

00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,940
you know you construct your manifest and

00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:35,210
you give it to Bosch and up comes a

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,220
thing a virginal thing a thing

00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,470
independently versioned from every other

00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,440
thing you brought up you bring L say you

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,289
wanted them so my demo was Redis this

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,519
was exciting I you know you go post

00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:48,309
instances you get a register cluster

00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,090
post instances another Redis cluster

00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:52,190
they could all be versioned

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,259
independently like I didn't have to

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,609
upgrade them all and it was just that

00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:59,659
was exciting couldn't you know anyway

00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:01,309
it was it engineer and I had the idea

00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:02,749
okay that's not working what else could

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,340
I do alright we could we could start

00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:07,519
doing independent services we could do

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,229
react as a service and not have to sort

00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,629
of jam it into our old system it doesn't

00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:13,549
have to be just for Engine Yard

00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:15,559
customers because 100 percent of

00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:18,440
engineer customers didn't want react

00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:21,619
I said Rao's I'm in react because they

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,739
weren't using it so what but no and then

00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:26,119
the last one I had was the idea of like

00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:28,309
this is really cool you could like use

00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:29,659
this as a a delivery system for systems

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:32,779
in the enterprise would be like an app

00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:35,119
store ok that was the last meeting I

00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:40,340
have the CEO and he didn't like that

00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:42,409
idea and so I left and there are so many

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:48,710
things we can do with this with this

00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:50,479
system so I wish to finish there hey

00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,710
there's an entire day of eventually

00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:54,919
stories they're going to come on that

00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:57,349
was that was how I got to Bosch I you

00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,029
know many of you have followed have

00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:01,039
joined my journey along the path in the

00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:02,989
first year well as julia engineered

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,779
there was there was like three public

00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:11,349
people playing with Bosch it was myself

00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:13,970
30 a couple others who Brian McLane

00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:16,580
maybe one or two others who names have

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,020
forgotten now but and then and they

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,300
started to grow

00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,340
and people started you know people said

00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,350
to find Bosch and then people started

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,710
use Bosch for reasons unrelated to

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:31,580
running Cloud Foundry and whilst it can

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:33,860
be a little painful to be so early it is

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,559
so exciting to have a room full of 200

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,570
people who think Bosch is pretty ok so

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:43,700
I'm pretty excited to sit down and shut

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:47,170
up for a whole week of talking so thank
