everything stand up

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,540

happened so huge thanks to Porter for

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,540

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,610
something like this to happen again

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,700
because it was a little bit difficult to

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,000
organize you have to go to bitly slash

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,670
