graph and everybody I'm the shower I

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,730
work at pivotal among the cloud

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,880
operations team at pivotal so some of my

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,660
role is to manage pivotal web services

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,529
so the talk is boss on your phone and

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,460
controlling your boss deployment from a

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,750
smartphone so next let's directly get to

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,720
like what the user experience looks like

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,369
so this is an Android device you spin

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,900
you start your boss application it shows

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,349
your deployments you can see Cloud

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,840
Foundry their further you click on a

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,640
deployment you see a whole bunch of

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,879
instances out there and you can see how

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:43,290
many instances of each job / instance

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,890
groups are there further you want to do

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,550
something you increase the routers and

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:54,930
hit deploy you have boss deploying stuff

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,300
in the back end so after a while you see

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,710
these three new routers out there and

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,049
Bosh has created new routers so some

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,960
background about why you would want to

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:13,380
do this how many of you have been in

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,460
operations or yeah it's painful how many

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,170
of you have been in cloud foundry

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:23,460
operations yeah it's slightly better out

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:26,790
there so the challenge like being on

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,479
coil is something that I have to do as

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,090
my job and it's quite a challenge to be

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,259
on call at night and on weekends it's

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,079
really annoying like if I'm going out

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,479
somewhere I have to take my laptop and

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:43,200
the jetpack and like make sure I have

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,450
internet access and all of that but and

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,460
then I started thinking that boss has an

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:53,130
awesome API why not leverage your phone

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,450
and basically use bosh to control use

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,670
your phone to control boss instead of

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,430
having to ssh and type of a bunch of

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:04,439
commands so Cloud Foundry problems are

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:07,619
effectively solved by scaling a whole

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,739
bunch of components particularly the

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,860
routers or the cells in particular so

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,210
the idea is whenever you get paged you

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,820
don't want to just have something

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,470
auto-scaling all the time but because

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,320
auto scaling is hard and it's hard to

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,460
figure out when you should auto scale

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,110
but you want to make an operator

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,080
judgment about hey it's a good time to

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,630
scale so the idea is whenever I get

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,390
paged I can just use my phone and look

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,850
at hey I need to scale this up I just

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,690
bump it up and go back to sleep and look

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:42,750
at problems the next day the idea is the

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,610
boss API plus a smartphone you're happy

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,380
operator because you're operating stuff

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:53,459
from your phone you don't have to go

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:54,930
anywhere else and that's about it I have

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,570
a demo which I didn't want to show as a

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,770
part of this lightning talk but see me

00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,900
afterwards if you're interested in that

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:05,680
thank you

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,680
