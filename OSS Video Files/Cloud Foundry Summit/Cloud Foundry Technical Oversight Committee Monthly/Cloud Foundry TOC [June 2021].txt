hey lee

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,759
how are you all right cool we're back to

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,360
recording so first

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,919
congratulations everybody for being

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,639
elected to the the toc

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,280
um hopefully the uh the election process

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
was

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,720
relatively smooth based on uh you know

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,680
what you went through as well as what

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
the uh

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
the broader community went through um

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,360
that tool is uh

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,280
no good so uh i'm a strong advocate of

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,280
switching to uh

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,600
the uh the one that that we see in use

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,360
um in the kubernetes community and a

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,639
couple other communities

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,600
that just kind of integrates with

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,960
github-based author authentication

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,199
so we don't have to do that wonky

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,440
two-step like figure out a person's

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,240
email address but not put it into github

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,039
because then it would be exposing

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,240
information

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,240
and yada yada so um i think hopefully we

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,960
can just shift to a github identity

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,479
based

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,039
scheme there cool

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,680
so david you did a good job of of

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,880
tossing

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,199
um five agenda items out and

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,880
i one of them was no actually a couple

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,000
of overlap with what i was going to

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,080
suggest for you all

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,039
right um and then i had a couple that

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,720
were

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:55,039
not as important but a little bit more

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,120
urgent if that makes sense um

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,400
so the we do have a summit coming up in

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,319
about a month right

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,240
so there's a few things that i wanted to

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,680
make sure that we got lucky we held by

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,880
tfc election i was a little worried we

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
were going to kind of like run further

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,680
and further we held it we got it now you

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,840
exist

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,360
um there are some roles that i'd like

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,520
some of you all to play

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,440
uh in that um both um

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,680
on a panel um as well as uh if if

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,919
if when we get to the tfc chair

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,319
discussion if you pick a chair

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,720
um if not that's okay too just one of

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,240
you maybe give a keynote for the

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,919
about 10 minutes long at the beginning

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,759
of day two

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,440
if you remember previous summits last

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,759
year actually specifically

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,800
um we had yui uh as the pmc council

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,440
chair

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,479
give that that day two you know kind of

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,440
intro keynote

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
doesn't have to be super complicated um

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,800
but

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,560
i think it's important to do so that's

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,520
what's on my mind i think why don't why

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,599
don't we actually start with um

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,720
let's start maybe with broader

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,319
conversation i just want to

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,080
before we roll into any of these

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,080
specific agenda items i guess

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,479
i want to make sure that everybody's had

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,240
an opportunity to kind of level set on

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:15,360
what the tfc's responsibilities are

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,720
um and and i guess where

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,440
where we got to in the reimagining the

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,120
way

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,120
the technical community was going to

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,560
operate um thankfully both yon

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,879
and eric have been involved in that for

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
a while um

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,400
so maybe we just pause there are there

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,399
any questions about

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,839
what you're supposed to do number one

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,560
and number two like

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:41,839
where we're at with uh with trying to

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,839
rework governance

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,360
uh i have a question about tsc

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,959
responsibilities that i probably could

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,839
look up but i just thought i'd ask

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,399
um let's do it uh it sounds it seems to

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,399
me like

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,519
one of the goals is also going to be to

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,839
set

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,360
like technical direction decisions that

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,640
cross the whole working group right like

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,399
there's a set of things that

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,640
are local to working groups and then

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,800
there's maybe a set of things like

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,399
what is the contributor commit process

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
or what are the roles of the working

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,680
groups

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,040
and so there's like cross cross am i

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,040
right the toc is responsible for the

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,320
cross working group definitions

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,440
yeah yeah a good

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,480
the the way that i think is the simplest

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
model to just

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
keep in your mind is that

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,120
the the work of the technical community

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,320
you know

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,399
essentially you have ultimate

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,360
accountability for number one

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,399
but then the inverse of that is that the

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,760
whole point of

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,959
being an open source project and we're

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,399
trying to get more you know organic

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,320
contribution occurring

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,160
is that is that as much of that

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,720
responsibility as possible should just

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,880
be

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,959
kind of brought down to at the lowest

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,560
level possible right so

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,240
you know when there needs to be

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,920
coordination you know you want that to

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,519
happen in a way that's efficient

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,080
you know you want it to happen a way

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,240
that um isn't going to result in

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,160
this thing that you know all of your

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,640
employers happen to rely on

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,440
uh kind of falling apart right so

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,279
there's

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,399
there's a need to balance you know those

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,680
those two perspectives so

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,360
philosophically

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,279
right you need to get as many decisions

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,880
as possible down into the right hands

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,360
uh the right minds you know the right

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,800
collaborations but also

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,640
your job is to make sure that that

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,640
actually works is that fair

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,200
yep cool i think it is yeah

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,720
we should push push back as much as

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,200
possible to other people

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,040
or delegate to other people there's

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,320
going to be some things

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,160
we can't yeah

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
all right i think this is part of not go

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,399
ahead i'm

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,560
going to say there's something you don't

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,519
want to you want to actually be the same

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,000
across

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,920
you could say that every code base gets

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
to decide its own process for making

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,320
commits

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,000
but that would make it very weird to

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,360
switch code bases

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,240
and you would actually want some

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,240
standardization there

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,399
yeah and i i think part of that that

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,760
we'll have to work out is um

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,800
the the feedback channels for

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,240
um keeping track of

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,320
or guiding that delegated responsibility

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,839
down to those lower groups so to know

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,200
that okay if we're giving the you know

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,760
this working group is being formed it

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,480
has

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,519
this responsibility then as part of our

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,360
mandate of being

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,720
ultimately accountable for that what

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
information are we going to need to hear

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,560
from them or

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,839
what collaboration are we going to need

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,399
to have with that working group to make

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,959
sure that

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,320
that's still proceeding as we view it

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,440
being valuable for the community

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,440
and for the project as well

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,120
so one one other thing that was um that

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,320
i think is important to just verbalize

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,880
because it's hard to wrap your head

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,200
around um we're using different terms

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,040
in the in the governance docs right one

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,680
one of those terms is working group

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,959
and another term is project and

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,320
understanding the difference between the

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
two i think is pretty important right

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,200
because

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,040
we had a the word project previously um

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,279
kind of made sense because you had this

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,399
team of committers wrapped around it

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,240
um and it owned some number of code you

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,079
know repositories and that that project

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,480
existed as a thing that kind of had its

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,560
own backlog and off it goes

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,800
um so maybe just drop that definition

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
from your mind for a minute and instead

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,079
think about

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,639
um a project is actually something that

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,079
is

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,760
uh it has a name it's you know maybe

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,839
branded right paquetto is a good example

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,519
of that where it's got its own branding

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:37,120
um and it's it's a released thing that

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,880
has value kind of in and of itself right

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,639
it's something that we would want to

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,240
point an end user

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,839
not necessarily a contributor or

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,639
commercializer right but you can point

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,839
end users

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,120
at these things and they have some

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,639
amount of value there's some way to get

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,760
started with just that

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,000
um so that's what we mean by a project

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
right

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,040
it's less about the people it's more

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,560
about the assets that they're

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,120
they're working on um and so then like

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,560
you know cloud foundry uh now then we

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,160
could kind of split hairs here and say

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,600
are we talking about cf for case are we

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,680
talking about group cf are we talking

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,120
about the cf you know vm architecture

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,800
but let's just keep it simple now cloud

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,079
foundry is a project it's kind of the

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,760
big anchor project

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,120
but there's little bits that also are

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,600
consumed by it

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,279
and can also be repurposed on their own

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,639
um and then the working groups is

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,320
is the is the is the main people

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,279
organizational

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,320
structure that's in place right um and

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,920
so

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,360
you know we we might say look working

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,200
groups um

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,440
as one example the bill pack working

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,040
group just making that up it's something

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
we had kind of doodled right

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,519
um there's a build pack working group

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,079
and it it really is responsible for

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,440
um two collections of build packs right

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,959
one of them is paquetto kind of

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,320
repurposable and then the others the

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,720
just the build packs that really only

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,920
work

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,680
in classic cloud foundry um

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
so we can create you create a work group

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,160
build packs and then

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,880
they have a project that they support um

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,440
does that make sense

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
okay that was one of the wonkier things

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,079
to kind of

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,279
you know wrap wrap all of our heads

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,079
around so i wanted to just make sure

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,440
that was uh

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,440
that was clear for everyone all right

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,199
so any other questions just kind of at

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,120
the high level

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,279
it's like i just wanted to add something

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,079
to that to that example

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,600
because i i guess we actually need input

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,680
from those people that would work

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,000
in these working groups for defining

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,320
those because one thing i could imagine

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,040
having as part of a build pack working

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,000
group is also working on for example

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,240
copy

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,920
to get back to actually have just have

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,120
one set of build packs which is the

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,120
cloud native ones

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,880
and that could be a contribution to that

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
but if that makes sense

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,279
or it doesn't make sense at all to group

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,760
something like a part of the copy code

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,240
base

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,800
as responsibility for a working group

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,600
that is not

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,959
copy i have no clue maybe that's

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,880
completely the wrong thing

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,040
so we definitely need these people on

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,519
board and probably interview them

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,560
maybe invite them to meetings with us to

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,000
discuss what they

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,880
think actually works um guiding

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,760
principles should come from us like why

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,839
would we

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,839
do something what do we want to achieve

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,040
and then we have to work with these

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,079
with all these all these people i guess

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,000
it's kind of

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,000
guiding and coordinating really

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,839
than break apart actually we should not

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,800
go into this specific example

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,079
because we have a lot of high-level

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,079
agenda items but i'm really excited

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,240
about talking about these problems

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,639
it's like i would actually even love to

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,680
lure the kpac fogs into the cff

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,920
community

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,800
but i i asked them already on private

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,880
slack and

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,920
seems they didn't really consider that

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,399
but that would be

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,600
another asset to put on to that but

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,279
anyway

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,480
not getting into these details that's

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,680
correct cool all right

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,279
um so so the first item that that we

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,399
should just talk about is the

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,120
is the chair so amongst the five

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,079
tsp members we need to have a chair at

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,000
some point

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,160
um the way to think about the chair role

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,560
is you're not in charge

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,240
right you're just simply gonna kind of

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,279
help with the coordination

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,120
of the meetings going forward um number

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,920
one and then number two

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,120
um your job is to represent the whole

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,000
toc

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,639
and the technical community um in the

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,279
foundation's governing board which

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,720
is is really it's all about like the

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,560
business aspects of the

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,320
the support around the project right so

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,120
it's it's budget conversations

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,800
it's uh you know they're they do kind of

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,639
get into kind of market and marketing

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,519
strategy conversations

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,279
um but that's that's the role of the

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,560
chair right so it ends up being it's a

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,720
bit more work

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,759
uh but you don't have an outsized vote

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,360
just so we're

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,560
kind of clear on how that works right we

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,759
were very careful when we were

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,079
describing

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,000
uh describing the role just to make sure

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,079
it's really clear that like

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,519
you coordinate what the agenda's gonna

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,400
be but you don't get

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,839
like you know the gavel to decide

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,280
exactly what the agenda is going to be

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,839
is that fair enough

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,720
so lots of additional work not a lot of

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,160
additional power

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,839
i mean it's like a win-win right

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,000
everybody it's totally a win yeah

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,160
yeah it's totally a win so i guess with

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,559
that ringing endorsement i would ask if

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,039
anybody um is willing to raise your hand

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,039
to do it

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,840
everybody's like wait more work

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,400
oh i feel like you pulled your mic down

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,480
does that mean you're volunteering

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,559
well i i mean um

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,760
i feel like i i would be all right at

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,520
you know the coordination

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,799
and facilitation aspects of that for

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,160
sure just in terms of

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,320
keeping us organized um one one thing

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,600
david and i had talked about briefly was

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,120
you know maybe we could

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,000
you know i think that um the

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,919
tc chair is is something that could be

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,520
um

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,200
dropped without any other consequences

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,520
so one thing that we could consider is

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,520
like maybe having some sort of rotating

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,600
uh assignment of that as well for like

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,280
three or six month periods

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,960
um so that's that's one model we could

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,799
also pursue where it would be like okay

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,160
you know your doc chair for your entire

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,080
term or something like that we could

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,160
deliberately decide to rotate it amongst

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,160
all of us to kind of share that load too

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,880
i don't know what what if other people

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,640
um would be interested in that or

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,799
i mean that sounds like a really

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,200
sensible approach to go down

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,799
so i don't see why not

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,720
i think it's going to be the most work

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,600
in this first period right like a lot of

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,039
stuff is going to have to get

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,600
established here so

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,960
i think if if nobody else wants it we

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,440
should take eric up on his

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,039
offer of extended time however we're

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,240
also aware that vmware and pivotal have

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,240
dominated the community

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,600
historically and so we want to make

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,520
space um

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,640
for this exciting role that everybody

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,240
wants if uh

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,520
if somebody else wants to give it a try

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,520
first i think that's very reasonable

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,799
thinking that you know since um your

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,080
organization doesn't have any other

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,679
representation

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,520
on the board you might also be

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,559
interesting as kind of a neutral

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,679
candidate

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,559
uh representative for the toc in

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,080
in those discussions it could be an

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,080
interesting one um

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,720
one of the things i'll have to check out

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,200
is around financial side of things

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,799
in relation to sitting within the

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,120
government space

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,320
so if you give me a chance to check that

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,600
with people

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,640
just in case there's any kind of

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,280
perceived conflict there

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,840
okay yeah sure that that totally makes

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,840
sense

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,799
all right so i think it's reasonable

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,600
then to

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,240
to say some people are thinking about it

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,360
you know lee

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,120
you maybe you could check on that um i i

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,240
like the point that

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,760
uh both eric and david made that um

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,320
there is a little bit of an optics to

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,840
this right the the way external people

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,120
are going to look at it when we say hey

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,440
this is the toc chair

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,880
like if it's a non-vmware person and i

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,120
love eric and david very much

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,480
but if it's a non-vmware person it's a

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,960
stronger signal to

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,320
community you know to go hey this is

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,280
like this really is like this new

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
governance process

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,480
and and you know maybe i should

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,880
re-engage um

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,120
you know if people have kind of gotten

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,960
uh frustrated maybe a little bit

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,919
um so i think that's totally fair okay

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,840
so so let's maybe we punt that uh one

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
week

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,240
um let's yeah definitely have it on the

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,039
agenda

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,320
uh for next tuesday to yeah uh to try to

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,640
resolve

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,679
yeah chip i'll probably send you some

00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,760
emails just to

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,000
get a bit of info from the board side of

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,200
things during the week

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,120
sure no problem not a problem um

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,320
and just really quick for you lee um

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,840
remember that gov dot uk

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,000
is a member you're an affiliate member

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,440
um

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,159
so no financial obligation um and that's

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,440
and it's also not a one-off for you

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,600
right it's a defined

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,039
membership tier for government and and

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,159
nonprofit

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:32,640
um and so yeah

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,440
just making sure that you remember that

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,559
context

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,600
so we're not asking for money and you're

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,600
and you're not gonna

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,840
not gonna be asked for money uh

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,200
investment it was more agreeing other

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:49,280
people of what they're doing with money

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:53,200
yeah yeah that's fair absolutely fair

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,240
okay all right so

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,080
um because i have some urgency i'm gonna

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,360
throw out a couple of maybe quick hits

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,200
um the

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,080
so in the summit right i talked about

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,799
someone maybe the toc chair maybe not

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,159
um i'd love somebody to give a keynote

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,280
it'll end up being a really quick

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,919
turnaround

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,640
deadline uh if we if we punt until next

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,960
week

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
um i'm okay doing that and i'm okay you

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,760
know telling our events team hey listen

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,039
they'll get it to you but like

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,240
we just decided so um i guess the

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,640
question would be

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,600
do we want to wait until um we decide

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,400
who the chair is

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,840
or would you is somebody willing to say

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,039
i'll just stand up and say i'm here to

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,679
represent the whole

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,200
new you know toc um and just talk a

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,640
little bit about

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
in fact maybe the process that we're

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,039
going to go through i think that might

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,480
be the best

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,840
you know topic to talk about for 10

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,600
minutes right what's the process we're

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,559
going through as a community to

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,559
change the way we operate

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,400
i i'd actually pick on yeah uh david

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,679
thank you i was gonna pick on either

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,039
john or eric honestly because because

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,600
you've been involved right both of you

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,600
have been involved

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,200
do you have any interest or willingness

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,400
to do that

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,840
i i actually don't even know about the

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,880
schedule like i

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,360
abstained all these online

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,480
uh conferences like all of them i've got

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,720
like he's saying he's not

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,159
they just don't they just don't sound

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,240
very interesting

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,919
yeah to to be to be to be frank it's

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,760
like the the the thing that was

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,240
important on cf summits was what's

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
what was happening on the floor not in

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,600
the like

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
i remember a couple of summits where i i

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,799
think i

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
attended one talk or something and it

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,600
was really worth it

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,679
like not the talk but attending the

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,720
summit so i don't even know if i've got

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,080
time

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,919
uh for that um

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,520
what time zone is the summit in again

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,720
chip like is this a disaster it's

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,400
uh it's it's us central time

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,919
in the morning us central time because

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,760
we're trying to we're trying to hit as

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,039
much of europe all the way through to

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,200
pacific so it would be like

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,880
three or four in the afternoon for for

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,799
yeon

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,640
yeah and i think yeah but it's also

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,559
they're also pre-recorded

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,559
right so so this is something that could

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,640
be recorded and it actually needs to be

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,799
recorded and sent in ahead of time we've

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,640
we've learned to like there's normally a

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,360
live q a period but for these

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,400
these kind of opening the event things

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,520
there's no q a

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,120
you just send a recording in and at the

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,640
tail end of the talk i've got a couple

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,559
of logistics slides i'll have to have

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,080
you like thank the sponsors and you know

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,640
just like a couple of brief things and

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,640
then you're done

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,200
yeah i just dropped a link in the zoom

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,679
chat to the schedule

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,799
um chip you said this is the day two

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,200
keynote

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,400
yeah okay so i think that's it is that

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,360
at 9 00 a.m

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,840
central time so yeah 7 a.m pacific yeah

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,039
okay but

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,679
but as you said like that's almost

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,760
irrelevant

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,480
when you're producing it for this

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,480
because yeah

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,600
yeah it's actually entirely irrelevant

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,880
for for the keynote for the people that

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,559
are giving the talks they need to be

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,440
there for the live q a

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,320
part of it so when do you think we need

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,919
to have like

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,000
slides drafted and the recording

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,919
actually submitted by

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,240
you know that's a really great question

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,240
um

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,480
that i should know the answer to because

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,480
i'm doing the day one

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,320
presumably like thursday or friday

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,919
before it's like because you're already

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,960
finished like for weeks

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,720
right yeah i mean

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,320
that's why you can't remember i haven't

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,640
even started um

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,640
okay so the official deadline is is

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,640
monday the 12th

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,320
um but like if it was on tuesday the

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,880
13th or wednesday the 14th it would be

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,679
okay

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,120
normally the the the keynotes are kind

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,640
of the last minute bits that we

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,640
we get over um

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:09,440
so essentially if we decide this

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,440
on the sixth right next week um

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,880
then it'll then i'll basically be five

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
you know working days

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,480
until we got to get a video in and again

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
it's it's like

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,240
10 minutes is what we're looking for

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,799
here and then a couple a couple minutes

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,520
after that

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:26,640
of uh administrative that i'll ask you

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,640
to just kind of tack on

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,240
yeah chip and you said like covering the

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,919
new the new process for

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,840
tech contributions in the community it's

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,360
probably the most relevant and

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,039
interesting content for that

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,039
i think so yeah i think so

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:57,919
all right nobody's jumping up and down

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,919
think about it next tuesday

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,440
yeah i think we can decision i think i

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,279
need to check my schedule a little bit

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,960
to see if i could fit that in

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,799
um and what why don't we we can continue

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,600
async discussion in the toc channel as

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,559
well

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,840
um jan maybe we could coordinate on

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,440
something although i mean 10 minutes is

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,200
not a lot of time to split so maybe

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,679
probably just having one speaker for

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,440
that is going to be most practical it's

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,720
not like it's even a 30 minute thing

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,720
that's true yeah okay yeah yeah

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,320
just a quick hello you know hey here's

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,279
the new toc let me explain what this

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,240
means

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,320
something along those lines i guess you

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,760
know introduce all of us you know put

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,760
some faces names

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,760
yeah sweet okay

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,720
all right um those are the things that i

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,240
cared about that are timely

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,120
um there's i was gonna ask you to help

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,039
me with like

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,399
making the choice about what projects or

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,279
working groups or initiatives you want

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,000
to have

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,919
slotted in for office hours but let's do

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,840
that async i'll just say these are these

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,559
are who i think we should do

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,520
how many slots we have and you all can

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,480
comment on that

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,480
um so

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,039
one two yeah i've got that and the last

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,360
thing

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,600
i had for you was just in general to see

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,320
does not have to be before summit um but

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,480
willing as individuals to pop onto a

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,760
live stream with uh with ram to

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,520
just have them kind of do an interview

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,799
introduce you it's just you know a video

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,559
thing that we want to

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,399
want to do it's all just you know

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,000
community marketing all right

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,679
all right so we'll just ram will reach

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,399
out to each one of you um

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,880
yeah it should be simple we will have

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,399
some

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,000
questions and directions that the

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,320
conversation might uh

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
yeah my director right because i might

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,520
have to check that with uh

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,320
legal like what i'm allowed to say or

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,840
or whatever you know that anyway yes i

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,320
know that

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,679
like actually even for for myself i'd

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,760
like to know that

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,880
yeah yeah yes no problem we could do

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,080
that

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,039
cool all right that's what would that be

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,919
at summit or um no this is after this

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,640
this is uh

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,960
probably going to be after um given that

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,440
we're

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
we're only a few weeks out for that so

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,720
it's just

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,399
we've been doing um live streams with

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,640
more technical content but

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,480
we're you know it's just like any like

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,960
twitch style stream right

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,520
um and videos are performing really well

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,840
we're getting

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,440
like actually new adopters trying cloud

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,360
foundry based on a bunch of video

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,559
content and i think we could also take a

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,760
crack at like

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,440
get contributors in the same type of way

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,039
to come in feel welcome and like want to

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,399
participate so

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,880
we wanted to take a swing like that

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,080
okay i should actually chip did you have

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,279
one other thing about

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,679
like the uh panel for summit

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,320
that was first on your list i thought oh

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,120
yeah

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,559
right thank you we do have a panel for

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,159
summit that we wanted to run

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:04,159
um so

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,559
the there's a couple thoughts um

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,600
the the first is that we wanted a

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,720
community leadership

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,320
panel um and

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,960
i would like as many of you as possible

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,919
to participate um alex williams from the

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,440
new stack will

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:22,320
will host it um will

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,520
jan he doesn't stick to scripts uh you

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,440
can talk to baron

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,960
uh you know about how sap has handled

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,960
working with him in the past

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,080
um so it doesn't really matter if i tell

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,640
you what he's gonna talk about right

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,279
like we

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,640
we feed him ideas um alex will talk

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,919
about whatever he wants to talk about

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,279
and ask you whatever he wants to ask

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,880
about that's the way

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,760
it's just the way it's gonna work um so

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,279
i will uh we'll be reaching out to try

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,679
to coordinate a time where we can get as

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,360
many of you as possible

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,600
the one the one thing that i'm going to

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,120
say though is that

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,760
you right now you are all

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,720
presenting as white men uh that's

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,960
unacceptable

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
from a diversity standpoint uh for a

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,080
panel um i actually think it's something

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,559
we need to work on for the next

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,440
election uh for the tfc we need more

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,600
diversity

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,120
we got great geographic and employer

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,120
diversity we're just missing

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:18,240
some of the different types of diversity

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,559
so i guess my question would be

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,159
to all of you are there

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,919
are there any individuals you can think

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,240
of that would help that would help us

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,880
more appropriately reflect the diversity

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,279
of the

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,320
community that you know people that do

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,840
play

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,279
a key role um you know angela chin is an

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,960
example of someone who we've had on

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,000
these things in the past i think she's

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,200
you know incredibly smart and has a lot

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,960
of opinions about

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,559
you know how things should evolve but i

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,880
also don't want to over rely on one

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,720
person so i'm fishing for

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,480
um who you think would make sense to

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,480
invite into that conversation

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,640
don't feel bad if they work for work for

00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,360
the same employer as you or don't it

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,960
doesn't matter

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,559
right it's just community members that

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,960
are important yeah

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,399
amelia downs has been incredibly active

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,399
in the community recently

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,279
yeah um on the vmware side maybe also

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,519
yali

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,360
i know she's been doing a bunch of work

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,600
on some cappy tracks

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,360
in the community and i think working

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,919
with pretty closely with some of the sap

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,480
folks

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:29,919
on that as well so i work so please

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,960
great work uh great to work with there

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:42,559
cool yeah

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:44,080
any other ideas

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,080
i'm sometimes off camera with kids but i

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,760
can hear you all and no it's okay

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,600
we we see the kids popping in and out

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,480
david that's not a problem

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,840
you will need to sign a release though

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,840
for the recording

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,240
all right cool so if somebody has a

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,840
brilliant idea at some point just

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,240
send me an email or send me a direct

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,080
message um i think both amelia and pialy

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,960
are great ideas so i'll reach out to

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,640
them as well

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,000
i just kind of loop them in and and

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,120
that'll uh we'll try to get that

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,960
coordinated

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,640
thank you eric for keeping me on track

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,640
with the uh my own list of things

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,840
well you said they're all origin chips

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,960
so you know yeah they are they're

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,960
they've got to take a behind

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,720
i didn't say that important i said

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,720
urgent all right

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,840
okay so at this point um we've we've got

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,919
a half hour

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,399
left and i would like to

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,440
fade back and stop talking this is now

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:48,159
your time to begin to get organized

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,120
so um but i will say david i have

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,840
resolved

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,840
uh item number five of your agenda

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,159
am i allowed to add channel is that what

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,679
you're saying or

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,360
you've resolved it by deciding to not

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,799
allow me to add channel it's so unclear

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,600
what you mean by that

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,640
uh well it was a feature not a bug but

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,639
now it's uh

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,639
i i you know you you have access

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,599
you're all workspace admins now oh man

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,159
thank you uh i had a few things posted

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,119
in the

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,079
slack channel as agenda items i think

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,240
maybe

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,240
the most there's important and urgent to

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,280
chip's vocabulary on that

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,960
um i think what's kind of urgent and

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,399
important is like when are we going

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,639
how are we going to decide what the set

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,960
of working groups are and when are we

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,800
going to have that decision by so that

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,200
people can kind of move on

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,800
and start to organize themselves right

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,240
because right now

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,159
people in the community at least on

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,359
vmware side don't know what the future

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,639
is and don't know if they're

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,079
what working group they're part of and

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,480
whether they're going to be a leader or

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,839
a

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,440
contributor just a member they don't

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,320
they don't know what's going on and so

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,320
the sooner we

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,240
create that list of groups and finalize

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,560
it with input

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,359
so it can't be instantaneously right um

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,280
but the sooner they can move on

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,720
there is uh there's a mirror already

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,920
right that uh

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,200
you should have eric yeah um some

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,160
sketches on that

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,000
on ideas but we definitely need to talk

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,720
to those people that would be members of

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,680
of groups

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
if that makes sense

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,480
yeah i think that's that's still linked

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,320
on the issue that

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,640
you or baron started i think you started

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,640
that young maybe even the pr with that

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,760
yeah maybe oh is that linked in there

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,560
yeah that's good

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,280
yeah so we can take that to answer to

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,839
answer

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,599
to david i think we do should do start

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,760
with that fast

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:49,520
and try to like yeah finish it first

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,320
but at least get some some first

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,880
some first things in i i would suppose

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,560
that we

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,480
that we um kind of invite people working

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,640
in those so maybe like the current

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,119
structure is

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,160
is still in place somehow right so there

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,000
are projects with

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,160
people that are members of those

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,280
projects and there are pms that are kind

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,280
of

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,880
like at least candidates for being

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,359
working group leads

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,480
so maybe we should ask those programs to

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,599
like send in

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,720
the representatives um

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,400
into like this call like next week or

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,760
the week after

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,720
um and start the discussion uh

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,400
around that uh and we should probably

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,560
try to move that

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,560
um offline after a first round of

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,040
discussion to get feedback from

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,280
basically everyone who wants to and not

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,200
like relying on representatives

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,800
something like that like i mean that

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,520
that's going to be a huge

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,880
meeting i guess like by at least taking

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,480
all pms in we're

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,240
i don't know already in the size that

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,160
can't decide anything

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,280
but um maybe we can get it into a format

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,800
that can then work

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,040
um in an asynchronous in an asynchronous

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,040
way

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,079
like like maybe maybe we should get in

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,160
input from

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,720
like the default would probably be pms

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,720
and anchors

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,440
but i'm not sure like i would actually

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,960
leave that completely to the projects

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,839
they might decide to send different

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,200
representatives

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,079
based on lack of time or a particular

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,480
interest in

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,520
in defining that or whatever criteria

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,520
they they would apply

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,160
yeah i think i think that you're right

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,400
john that

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,760
that if we try to get explicit consensus

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,240
uh from everyone then that won't be

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,490
productive just because of the scale

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,540
so um

00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,540
[Music]

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,760
i think yeah maybe it would make sense

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,200
to even like async solicit

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,599
um initial thoughts or concerns from

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,520
from those project representatives maybe

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,320
then we could come up with

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,280
a proposal for working groups based on

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,359
that

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,320
and circulate it for comment and

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,960
feedback

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:16,000
with some um some expectation of

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,760
like maybe relatively quick deadline

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,359
for that commentary period i know that

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,960
may be tricky as uh

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,119
we're moving into vacation season as

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,800
well unfortunately but you know

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,960
if we also say like you know each

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,240
project should um

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,839
have representative it doesn't have to

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,000
be the project lead or attack the

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:36,160
technical lead for the project

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,359
um so it's actually the

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,160
the last pr left i still put a link in

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,760
yeah into the zoom chat so maybe we

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,760
should just use that pull request that

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,839
was like i started that as kind of a

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,720
straw man like how could that look like

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,480
to just get a first sketch of what could

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,160
work and then i think we had a couple of

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,640
meetings where we started to look into

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,599
that

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,640
and um came up with a mirror that is

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,240
indeed linked

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:05,040
in this pull request um

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,760
yeah and then maybe we use that pr to

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,200
actually

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,760
get feedback i mean there is

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,119
there is a kind of proposal the list of

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,400
potential working groups

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,079
in in text there's a probably different

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,160
proposal in miro that we might

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,200
want to get into text form and then we

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,440
can

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,119
i i think that's easier to comment on

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,720
with you with the default

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,839
github means

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,000
so maybe that's one maybe

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,000
i think this is great i'm wondering what

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,760
what the toc could provide is

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,599
a little bit of a decision or guidance

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,920
around resolution of working groups

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,640
for example one working group cloud

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,119
foundry

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,960
that has one option right another option

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,880
is one working group per project these

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,359
are extreme options right but

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,800
somebody like we would like to provide

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,000
guidance on the resolution

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,320
of like a reasonable size or maybe the

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,400
number of working groups that kind of we

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,720
imagine makes sense is a rough

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,400
guideline is it three is it five is it

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,920
ten

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,760
i can't quite figure that out i think

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,319
there are advantages to having fewer

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,079
personally because there's overhead

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,280
leadership overhead associated with each

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,119
group

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,880
and so we have to look at the level of

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,839
maturity of the where the community is

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,520
at and try to figure out how what

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,160
resolution of working groups we're

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,760
suggesting we would like the end result

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,319
to be

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,920
yeah one one thought on it if you have

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,280
less working groups it means more

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,599
cooperation between the

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,359
technical projects that's something that

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,359
usually helps

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,280
it makes work in the working group

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,160
harder but

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,920
the technical stuff anyway works i would

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,720
hope at least

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,520
a level below and can can work on its

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,720
own

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,520
yeah just to add to that i'd say

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,800
by not having so many you're less likely

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,440
to find that things drop

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,839
off the uh the radar and become stagnant

00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,680
in

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:06,079
quite the same way as we have seen with

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:08,560
some projects

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,680
well you're concerned about like some

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,040
you know if there's a large working

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,640
group with a lot of concerns some of

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,760
those could just fall off onto the back

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,640
burner

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,680
or seemingly at the same time lots of

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,800
very small

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,839
working groups of four contributors that

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,839
then

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,240
you find that the interest gets lost and

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,599
then it loses momentum

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:34,640
oh yeah so yeah getting that balance

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:36,560
right is quite a key thing

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,400
so then maybe we're agreeing that we

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,839
want smaller number than maybe we've had

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,079
before when it comes to like projects

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,040
for sure and so we're looking for what

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,560
is the

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,800
smallest number of working groups that

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,560
reasonably make sense

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,839
because you can't have one cloud foundry

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,359
one right like

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,040
like what are the what are the things

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,920
that really make sense to be

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,400
in different areas such that we end up

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,760
with like

00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,040
i don't know three to five working

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,839
groups or something like that three to

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,839
six somewhere in that range

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,520
yeah i think i think that also just you

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,680
know given

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:16,400
given the um breadth of the

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,319
um contributor base at this point i

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,480
think that sounds more practical to have

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,440
like 10 towards a smaller number of

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,880
working groups

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,680
initially and you know that's the great

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,560
thing about the toc is that we can also

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,040
handle the merger or cleavage of those

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,800
working groups over time

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:44,160
if if we and those working groups think

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:45,920
that it's necessary

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,839
so then maybe what we're actually asking

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,720
the community and the project leads for

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,760
is

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:55,200
you know help us design a few

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,319
options for having between three to six

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,680
working groups

00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,599
that are reasonably well defined and

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,680
makes sense but are large enough to be

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,680
considered quite active and interesting

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,280
thinking in terms of time frame like

00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,560
like can we pick a deadline that we set

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,119
for ourselves about when we're going to

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,319
provide

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,680
the the decision for folks if we can

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,119
always extend it but can we can we

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,000
estimate when we think we might be able

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,839
to tell everybody the results

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,200
well i guess we need to give people time

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,839
to give us their

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,599
insights and opinions what sort of a

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,960
time period do we think is reasonable

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:41,839
for that

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,839
a week two weeks

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,680
that would be too aggressive probably

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,800
for a decision

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:56,079
we could shoot for the end of july

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,599
we could also say six weeks from now

00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,440
would it be that's kind of the range of

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,560
times just one idea would it be an

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,599
option to have a

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,440
sort of an open office hour of the toc

00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,440
at the summit where people who are

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,319
interested in working in this working

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,560
groups or designing the working groups

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,160
uh could participate and start a

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,839
discussion that could be a bit more

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,400
interactive and getting the feedback

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,400
immediately

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,640
we could you could also use one of you

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,680
know these weekly calls

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,760
right because this is open um

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,359
we've got you know julian from na9s and

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,839
ram joined um

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,040
so i mean you could you could explicitly

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,079
say hey

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,680
this upcoming meeting

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,240
is intended to have a discussion about

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,839
that um i think the the office hours

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,280
might be a little bit too short to have

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,839
like a whole bunch of opinions come

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,520
together

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:50,079
so does that make sense then i would

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,160
probably shoot for having a meeting uh

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,960
dedicated to that in two weeks

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,960
and give people time to actually

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,880
asynchronously already provide feedback

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,000
so they have two weeks and there's that

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,560
deadline where

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,440
we expect like whoever didn't yet show

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,839
up

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,960
asynchronously shows up and we have next

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,480
week to

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:13,440
do things like doc chair and maybe other

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,599
other other other things so like there's

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,119
at least that one topic of toc chair

00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,720
that would already make it a meeting

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,760
that is not dedicated to

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,440
let's let's bootstrap the working group

00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,000
and i think so maybe that's

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,079
that's fair and then i don't know like

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,160
from from there

00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,359
how long do we take do we need to

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,000
actually

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,280
like digest the input and come up with a

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,280
proposal

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,800
and align that with those that provided

00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,000
feedback i mean we we can still

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,359
misunderstand

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,520
their feedback and come up with

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:49,680
something that where they say yeah well

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:52,400
you should listen not think too much

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,920
so i guess another two weeks at least

00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,800
right

00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,800
yeah i think at least

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,760
that would be practically it will get

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,359
the the interesting part because you

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,040
won't start a working group

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,119
unless you have somebody who is willing

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,200
to uh to put time inside

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,760
to lead the working group and that's

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,560
maybe who knows what the feedback is so

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,839
it's difficult to estimate i would say

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,119
yeah i think that that's a great point

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,880
to find we can make all the working

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,480
groups that we want to but if we don't

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,599
have the buy-in from the people who are

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,119
going to staff them then they're just

00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,960
not going to work

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,800
thinking about the working group that

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,560
deals with release integration you can

00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,000
imagine what is going

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,599
on there in the future i i don't dare to

00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,760
predict

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:40,000
whatever comes out well maybe we could

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,359
we could aim for end of july early

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,560
august i mean that's already getting to

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,920
six weeks to

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,319
to try to have that working group

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,319
structure decided and proposed

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,760
but you know the real metrics that maybe

00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,160
we want to measure around that

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,920
are do we have people that are gonna

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,680
staff the working groups

00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,880
um to actually make them function like

00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:02,480
having having at least those lead roles

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,119
and some approvers um penciled in

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,599
for the membership in those working

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,359
groups

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,720
people that we feel like would be would

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,839
be adequately committed

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,839
to that initial seating

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:22,240
carrying this explicit about dates i'll

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:24,800
have to add that like from end of july

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,079
there's a three weeks vacation on my

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,480
side

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:32,480
so if it gets into august then

00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,760
then it's going to be end of august

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,119
something like that

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,040
but anyway yeah

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,160
so yeah so given this the buy-in is the

00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,280
most important thing like

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,400
doesn't doesn't work without

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,960
so it sounds like we're going to

00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,920
communicate shortly that we would like

00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,359
to have a session

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,680
an interactive session about this two

00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,400
weeks from today in the meantime

00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,240
give us feedback about you know possible

00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,880
options for working groups such that

00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,400
they're reasonably large um and

00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,000
reasonably well divided and you know

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,880
submit proposals or comment on existing

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,720
proposals

00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,880
so on uh and then come talk to us

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,599
interactively sorry my kids are like

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,720
yelling at each other in a very cute way

00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,640
so

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,559
uh okay that sounds good why don't we

00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,599
try to have it decided by the end of

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,680
july

00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,960
since a lot of people have there's some

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,720
vmware vacation

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,000
at the end very beginning of august 2

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,640
that's kind of like come

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,280
group wide which is going to affect this

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,480
so

00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,920
i think if we can try to have this

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,880
decided by the end of july a lot of

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,599
people are going to disappear for a

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,520
little bit

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:36,240
after that and also it's your choices

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,240
are not permanent

00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,680
they can change your clarity doesn't

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,200
work exactly you got to give people

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,240
clarity so they can move on and know the

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,480
new structure

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,480
yep

00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,480
well it seems seems like an async thing

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:55,200
we could do right now

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:58,720
is to uh solicit those representatives

00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,480
from the current project leads

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,319
to at least make that make them aware

00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,640
that this process is happening

00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,640
and

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,200
get that meeting two weeks from today on

00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,960
their schedules

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,800
kind of get that responsibility of

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,640
participation in that assigned

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,839
whether it's the current project leader

00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,839
or someone they want to delegate

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,400
and i guess we should oh sorry i was

00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,680
going to say have we got a

00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:31,839
handy contact list of those current

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,839
project leads and contacts

00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,920
yeah somewhere i have to dig it up

00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,839
yeah that's probably the first starting

00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:45,839
point knowing who to

00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,839
talk to first of all

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,880
i'll dig it up and drop it in the slack

00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,720
channel for everybody

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,000
at least the best one that we that we've

00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,200
got

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,319
the community has been uh doing a lot of

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:04,640
organic shifting

00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,640
under underneath so

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,839
all right so i'll get that to you post

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,839
meeting or during

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:30,400
all right so what else is on your agenda

00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,079
uh let's see there was a we gotta

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,920
figure out how to ship this bionic thing

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,119
as the default cloud foundry supported

00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,119
tested thing

00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,559
that was my like fire like this is

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,800
urgent though not

00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,400
incredibly important um but there's a

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,520
bit of a gap right now

00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,480
all right do we know what's what's going

00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,480
on next like

00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,400
what is it going to take to make cloud

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:55,839
foundry defaults up bionic and feel like

00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,839
supported and validated and tested

00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:05,760
so i mean uh for wk pass we are running

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,880
pretty much all on bionic apart from the

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,599
auto scaler

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,920
that's the only bit that isn't and we've

00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,960
not had any issues actually i

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,200
even helped 18f with their upgrade

00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,440
so that's that's run nice and smoothly

00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,680
for us

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,680
i would say same for sap we run

00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,240
everything on bionic

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,079
and if you want to reference any of the

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,079
wk power stuff it's

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,640
all in the open conveniently over

00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,640
alphagov

00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,720
what do you think the differential is

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,559
between uh you know how you approach

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,680
that and what kind of the default cf

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,040
deployment

00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,760
looks like because i think that's what

00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,960
david's talking about is

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:52,720
um as an open source consumer

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:57,119
of cloud foundry when i install it

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,119
i would like to have bionic be the thing

00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:01,680
i think the underlying question is not

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,359
bionic or senior or whatever right the

00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,960
underlying question is who takes care

00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,000
that sea of deployment is regularly

00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,599
released

00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,040
that's the real question so let's not

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,640
talk around it right

00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,839
yeah fair and like the first order of

00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,119
business for the maintainers of cf

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,280
deployment is when

00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,720
are we going to make bionic the default

00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,319
thing right

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,319
and when and how are we going to

00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:23,359
validate it that like

00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,040
you know how are we going to get this

00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,880
community-owned concourse to be

00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,079
validating see let's see if deployment

00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,800
is in fact

00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,640
working correctly on bionic which is

00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,880
kind of the gap in my mind

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,520
if we could close that gap and have

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,680
green builds running in the open

00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,640
then it's a relatively easy option to

00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,960
just

00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,480
change over right change the default

00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,599
stem cell the problem is really that we

00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,800
don't have

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,880
that work done yet uh is anybody

00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,319
interested in doing that work like is

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,040
anybody

00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,720
uh on the other vendor's side planning

00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,559
to take on that that uh

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,559
setting up because we we're just trying

00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,000
to sequence our engineers time to come

00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,359
help with that effort

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:15,599
but we haven't gotten anything in that

00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:18,160
channel yet

00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,000
so i'm not aware of such activities from

00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,720
from the sap side i mean we took over

00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,920
the

00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:27,200
bionic stem cell building

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:30,319
and generation so we hope that

00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:42,880
let's say also other contributors can

00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:44,160
kick in here

00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,400
sorry just dealing with the kids in the

00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,880
background okay so it sounds like we

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,480
don't have anybody willing to sort of do

00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,079
this work we i've got

00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,599
dave walter ready but if if we can find

00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,520
a vendor who's willing to collaborate

00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,520
here on

00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,960
on switching over we can have a better

00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,200
community story

00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,200
right

00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,800
and then we'll also solve this problem

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,400
with the working groups right

00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,440
for where sea of deployment is the

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,839
distribution challenges land

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,640
i mean the way is absolutely uh right to

00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,160
put

00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,920
the conquerors and the projects

00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,880
everything into the community

00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,000
owned procedures that makes definitely

00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,839
sense

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,839
but yeah it then boils down who is

00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:34,720
leading this working group and which

00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,720
yeah is there a team behind it because

00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,079
if there's no team behind it then

00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,079
this one is dead

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,359
pretty soon

00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,160
are there are there any um other

00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:56,400
impediments to actually

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,520
um getting those pipelines up and

00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,839
running at this point

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,119
or like is the infrastructure already

00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,760
and we just need to find the right

00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,559
people

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,559
who are going to

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:08,400
be available and committed to

00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,400
maintaining it um

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,160
i mean it's not just cf deployment right

00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,920
uh tons of dependencies who's

00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,760
responsible for cuts who's responsible

00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,119
for smoke tests who's responsible for

00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,559
bosch backup and restore

00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:23,060
and you name it so many projects

00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,760
just windows sets what's that

00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:28,960
[Laughter]

00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:32,400
i doubt that you find anybody

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,160
who just has this oversight for this

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,440
project so the best thing i could

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,040
imagine is that

00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,280
it ends up in some collaborative

00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,960
working mode but from organizational

00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,359
point of view that's

00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,280
the most challenging setup and at the

00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,920
end of the day at cf deployment

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,079
at least for the bosch based pass that's

00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,079
where

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,520
it gets decided whether that's a

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,520
delivery channel right

00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,880
whatever happens in any other project is

00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,960
completely uninteresting

00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,799
as long as it doesn't get released via

00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,119
safe deployment that's at least my point

00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,119
of view

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,480
but yeah it does sound like that that is

00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,559
going to be one of

00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,680
the um like a significant responsibility

00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,200
of some working group

00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,880
so it would ultimately fall to those

00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:22,559
people so

00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:24,640
um all right i mean maybe in

00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,720
in the interim you know given that it's

00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:30,160
going to take at least a month or so

00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,240
for us to um

00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,359
finish and roll out the working group

00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,000
structure

00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:37,280
um we can continue this as you know an

00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,480
ad hoc

00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,359
um more urgent matter to resolve for the

00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,680
community because

00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:47,119
you know that the xenial stem cell

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,119
default is just going to get more and

00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,960
more stale over time

00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,920
and be less relevant and even less

00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,920
secure for the community

00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:01,520
okay well um let's let's

00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:04,720
see what we can do also to coordinate

00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,359
async um on this but we we might want to

00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,920
keep

00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:09,040
trying to push this forward um in

00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,440
subsequent meetings

00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:16,319
given the level of urgency

00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,440
do you have any idea how we could get a

00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:22,000
buy-in from let's say

00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,000
important enough companies to support i

00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,480
mean whatever we decide from

00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,480
technical oversight point of view it's

00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,480
nice but

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:34,240
yeah not enough i would say you need

00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,040
buy-in and the willingness of companies

00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,040
to to really support here and

00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,240
that's a critical thing and at the

00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,440
moment i

00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,799
have the feeling everybody is playing um

00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,880
in german there's a special word for

00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,799
that but

00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,760
mikado don't know it's untranslatable

00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:53,440
for me i'm not good enough in english

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,680
everybody is waiting that somebody else

00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,920
moves that's the translation

00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,040
yeah we have to get over that and i

00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,680
don't know if the

00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,040
talk is the right uh here or if we need

00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,839
help from the governance board or

00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,960
whatever but

00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,960
to get that one moving

00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,200
i think with the initial friction done

00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,440
everything else will then

00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,440
follow and it's not a technical problem

00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,640
that this needs to be solved i mean

00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,640
there's enough it

00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,240
might be complex if you look at the

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,760
pipelines of cf deployment that's a lot

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,440
of fun but um

00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,440
that's not the real issue the real issue

00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,760
is

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,760
i mean us as a technical oversight

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,720
committee committee deciding on

00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,720
something like that

00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,480
doesn't change the thing like because

00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,440
you need the workforce

00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:42,079
actually doing some some stuff but also

00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,680
i'd say there's nobody hindering us to

00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,040
start with announcing

00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,359
a single working group right now and say

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,520
let's see how we get that stuff

00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,400
and delay the rest of that structure to

00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,799
a little later

00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,720
like we don't have to wait four weeks

00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,160
until we then say yeah well and by the

00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,680
way there's a big problem

00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,040
there's no staffing for this working

00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,599
group that we really think should be

00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,720
there

00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,640
so we could immediately start seeing how

00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,640
such a working group could be

00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,200
established i mean it's pretty

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,960
clear that for the bosch based cf

00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,240
delivery that's the current

00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,799
community delivery channel

00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,520
this has to be part of a working group

00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:22,400
right

00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,400
that's already clear

00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,599
and it also we could start it smaller

00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,920
than we maybe think it's going to be

00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,520
as in what are the things for sure we

00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,720
would group together maybe it's cats and

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,720
cf deployment

00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,839
right and like anything else is maybe

00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,119
contentious like

00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:39,200
it could go somewhere else but we could

00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,960
say those two things

00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,400
are these collective distribution and

00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,960
validation

00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,160
community-owned artifacts let's put them

00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,079
in a working group

00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,200
um vmware wants to have people on that

00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,880
working group like

00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,319
we will contribute in that area

00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,440
hopefully other vendors will contribute

00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,520
in that area

00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,559
maybe even get some leads in that area

00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,839
and

00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,920
and then we know who's going to do the

00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:02,000
bionic validation and you know

00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,079
committing

01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,440
actually i like that idea oh sorry go

01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,440
ahead i was gonna say part of it it

01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,480
actually is looking at it and chunking

01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,119
up the

01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:14,400
work streams in such a way that it makes

01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:17,200
it easily accessible for people

01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,680
and look at tagging things suitable for

01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,079
first-time committers to the project

01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,040
try and get new blood in that way rather

01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,440
than looking for

01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:28,880
a large entity that's going to take on a

01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:31,200
big package of work

01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,720
i mean this is getting accessible to the

01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,079
community that's something that

01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:39,520
is actually uh yeah something

01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:42,480
which can be improved a lot so we as a

01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,160
team now at sap we are trying to

01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,319
contribute to the cloud controller

01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,520
since quite some time and it's really

01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,280
not easy

01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,599
that's all i can say and there are so

01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,119
many it's not because of the people or

01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,240
i don't want to blame anybody we get

01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:59,040
good support but just

01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,119
how to open a pr uh with a space

01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,720
supporter or how the project is managed

01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,799
in the beginning it was a lot

01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,119
uh it's moving in the right direction

01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:10,400
but i think

01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:13,920
we can do better and

01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:16,400
get more approachable and yeah

01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,400
julian

01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:24,640
yes hello i'm just a guest so

01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:27,040
um please tell me from somehow

01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,559
disturbing the conversation but i was

01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:31,920
wondering for a while now

01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,839
how um well from the external

01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,359
views it appears that a lot of larger

01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,640
corporates they pulled back from the

01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,119
foundation and

01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:41,200
and the community and i was wondering

01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,520
how work capacity evolves

01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,960
over time in terms of contribution so

01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,799
that the project

01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,640
remains stable it's one of the reasons i

01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:52,000
dialed in today

01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:54,000
and i was also wondering is

01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,799
it going to be the right time for a

01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,240
small organization to offer some help

01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:02,880
although the magnitude we can contribute

01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,520
is naturally smaller than it may be

01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,480
necessary but

01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,000
especially the the question about the

01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,720
process and how it looks like and

01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,680
whether

01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,559
what's the minimum contribution an

01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,559
organization

01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:20,160
should be uh should be able to give

01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,400
that that's that would be something that

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,400
really

01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,680
catches my attention

01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:31,039
uh yeah julian i think i can speak to to

01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,480
some of your questions about like

01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,240
you know one is this the right time for

01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,480
smaller organizations and

01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,760
what is that minimum because this is

01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,720
something that we we've been talking

01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,920
about a lot

01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:44,000
in in rethinking the governance uh

01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,599
i think generally speaking we we want

01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,480
there to be a

01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:50,720
much lower barrier to entry for any

01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,760
organization that wants to contribute

01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:55,599
that's what we've been working out in

01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,359
the new rule definitions for the working

01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,680
groups i don't know if you've

01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:01,119
looked at the community repository and

01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,319
the cloud foundry github org but i'll

01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,200
drop a link in

01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:06,240
once i pull it up to uh the rules

01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,760
document

01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,440
uh that's setting those expectations

01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,240
across the what the working groups would

01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,559
be

01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,480
but you know even there it's not just

01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,799
like the previous model where

01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,160
um there were those more cohesive teams

01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,520
around projects

01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,760
that required a lot more commitment

01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,119
this is intended to be much closer to

01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,319
other communities

01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:31,039
that have allowed you know

01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,000
maybe some expectations of regular

01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,599
contributions

01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,520
from anyone who has authority within a

01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,880
working group but in general

01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,440
um the intent would be to make it a lot

01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,200
easier

01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:46,480
for um individuals even to

01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:49,760
have much more of a part-time dedication

01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,760
to any of the projects

01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:55,280
that's a good point um so just to give

01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:57,200
you some food for thought

01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,359
in my organization we've historically

01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,920
been we've historically been a ruby on

01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:04,079
rails shop so we have a large fraction

01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,000
of rails developers

01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,680
uh we do data service automation there

01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,720
are people who use bosch

01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:14,079
like quite a lot and we do have uh

01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,960
the operations department which is um

01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,079
what i'd say trained in in taking uh

01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,760
cloud foundry releases

01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,440
and shipping them to empire enterprise

01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,920
customers so let's say there are

01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,440
different

01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:29,359
specialization in in those teams

01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:31,599
i i think um if we taken

01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:32,400
a work capacity that's what i would

01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,240
let's say a

01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,440
number of hours that my organization

01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,240
could contribute

01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,440
it could be well let's say that there

01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:44,000
could be an affinity of of certain

01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,599
people in certain projects in certain

01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,799
groups within our company

01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:51,599
to certain projects not all of them

01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:54,400
but to some of them and finding out

01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,160
what's the best way to organize that

01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,720
find people who are willing to do that

01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:02,400
maybe invest some spare time

01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:04,160
in addition to the time we will give and

01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:09,839
to make that rewarding for both ends

01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:09,839
that'll be the challenge i see

01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,640
well thanks for listening and if if at

01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,359
some point there will be

01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,680
communication towards like how this

01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:20,480
could

01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,119
could be done or that if they're more

01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,640
well

01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,319
if you want to talk to an organization

01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,280
who's willing to do that well count me

01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:29,200
in because that's

01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:31,839
it's basically there is some um

01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,200
willingness to do so as long as it you

01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,400
know works out with our day-to-day

01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,319
business we'd be happy to

01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,319
to contribute something finally

01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,520
well we did in the early days but julian

01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,680
this is this is the forum right so

01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,720
so if you can come next week or send at

01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:50,240
least have somebody

01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,039
come next week um that's how you can get

01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,960
keep the pulse

01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,240
on like oh look there's it looks like

01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,880
now there's going to be a swarm of

01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,240
activity

01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:00,960
as we try to solve this uh you know

01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,319
new stem cell line um how do we

01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,760
percolate that through the all the

01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:06,559
projects right

01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,680
this is this is the i would say the the

01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,359
key place

01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,680
um and then you know individual

01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:13,200
contributors as these work groups pop up

01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,799
they need to just dive in if it's an

01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,280
area of interest right so

01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:19,200
as cappy kind of cleans up its

01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,760
engagement model

01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,119
that's all you know ruby code we'd love

01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,920
to have your ruby experts

01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,520
show up and even just you know help

01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,400
clean the code base who knows

01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,039
all kinds of good stuff there well

01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,200
because that's

01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,319
that's something interesting i mean uh

01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,799
from my experience

01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,440
in for example in in earlier research

01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:40,559
projects

01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,799
the there must be a some alignment

01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,599
with the goals that the teams have

01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:46,640
anyway

01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,640
so for example if i was to look for for

01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:51,119
somebody volunteering to take on

01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,400
like say a whole project within the cf

01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,880
foundation

01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,760
that'll be hard so on boarding a new

01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,640
problem that they

01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,039
haven't had before that i think will be

01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:04,480
harder to sell than for example to

01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:06,480
so if we if we if we invest or reverse

01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,640
the perspective for a second and ask

01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,559
what's the fear of any lines for example

01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:14,240
to happen with cloud foundry

01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:17,359
i think there's some some some momentum

01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,000
for example what happens if bosch dies

01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:20,480
away

01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,039
just be temporary deprecated and there

01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,480
will be no

01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,599
security uh patches anymore and and

01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,160
that's the kind of

01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,440
of of area where companies like mine

01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,760
will be

01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,280
much more willing to contribute than for

01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,760
example to

01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,920
take responsibility on a chair and like

01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,640
on board more additional auger work

01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,799
which we

01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,400
as a mid-sized company struggle to do

01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,200
anyway because we have too many

01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,480
engineers and

01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,480
they don't want to do these things

01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,079
makes sense i mean i second that

01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,640
definitely because

01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:54,480
that's also how my team got into the

01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,880
community so we run

01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,520
a special type of cf deployments bosch

01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,599
based

01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,680
with very large installations and we saw

01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:04,720
that the cloud controller simply

01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,160
has some gaps here and there and that's

01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,319
how we slowly got in

01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:10,000
and we have seen some slow requests in

01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:12,640
our installations that may not pop

01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,160
up in smaller installations and then one

01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,960
commit or one pr

01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,799
after the other comes in and that's how

01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,000
it started it also didn't start from

01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:24,080
we want to put something or generically

01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,719
lead something but it's concrete

01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,880
problems and

01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,839
yeah that's uh that's that that makes

01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,960
sense to me too

01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:35,040
so we have basically uh new groups

01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,880
digging into kubernetes and and cloud

01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,799
foundry focus

01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,799
we are training up new engineers you

01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:44,000
know writing operators and stuff because

01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:46,080
porting data cells and so on so it's not

01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,600
only about bosch based cloud foundry but

01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,400
it's definitely where our money comes

01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,400
from

01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,319
and therefore there would be an area of

01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:56,000
interest so maybe

01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:57,279
if if areas show up where participation

01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,960
would be necessary

01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:01,040
feel free to ping me at any time i'll

01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:04,480
try to contribute more

01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:06,560
to these calls but

01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,000
i'm new to this although i've been in

01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,400
the community for very long

01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,080
i don't know really how to play uh or

01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,440
interact with the foundation very well

01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,759
after admit that's

01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,759
on me

01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:22,560
great that's great to know i think i

01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:23,679
think essentially what we're kind of

01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,640
trying to figure out is

01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,279
what imagine a set of working groups all

01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,560
of the

01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,560
different vendors that might be involved

01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,440
what roles do they want to play in those

01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,960
groups like

01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,480
what i hear from julian is like i want

01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,359
some members in a few areas and i'm

01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,640
happy to help

01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,239
in areas that are strategic to me which

01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,640
is true for everybody right it's just

01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:40,080
our

01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,759
the level of role that we might want to

01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,679
take in different areas you kind of like

01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,040
merge those requests all together

01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,199
and you identify areas that are

01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,080
underfunded by everybody and then chip

01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:50,560
go

01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,359
and or the tsc says hey team we really

01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,880
need

01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,280
people to step up in this area even

01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,560
though it's not 100 strategic because

01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,640
we don't have enough contribution in

01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,320
that area so you might even want to

01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,040
restructure the working groups based on

01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,320
who's

01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,640
interested in contributing in various

01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:06,080
areas so like we kind of need to collect

01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,320
that information and then

01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,920
play various scenarios in order to

01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,239
figure out what structures make sense

01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,760
and

01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:14,000
who's going to play which part and what

01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,000
thing

01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,360
we'll brainstorm some ideas about ways

01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,120
we can collect that information

01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,719
some information theory stuff maybe and

01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:24,400
try to figure out

01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:24,400
how to how to make that viable

01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,000
i think we are overtime and i got to get

01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,120
my kids to school as you can hear

01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,159
disaster over here um yep but

01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,159
uh so i think we should call it

01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:38,400
good deal all right everyone thank

01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,320

01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,360
on youtube so

01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,199
we can share it and i'm assuming

01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,199
somebody's going to take the action

01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,560
one of the tfc members to communicate

01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:51,679
with the rest of the community

01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,120
