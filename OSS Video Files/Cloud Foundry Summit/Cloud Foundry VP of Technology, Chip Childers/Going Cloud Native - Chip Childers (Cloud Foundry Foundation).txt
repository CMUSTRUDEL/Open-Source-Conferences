so you're going to need a platform and

00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,530
it really could be anything it could be

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,940
a set of shell scripts my favorite

00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,100
example of a platform that can deliver

00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,580
on this type of promise is a ticketing

00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,169
system think about it right you go into

00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,300
a ticketing system and you ask for some

00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:24,279
more capacity from your operations team

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,800
you have some drop downs and that's an

00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,659
interface it's almost an API maybe even

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,460
have an API into a ticketing system now

00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:31,329
that's not a great platform right

00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,410
because there's people running around

00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:35,770
behind the scenes that are going to have

00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:39,000
to deliver it for you but what exactly

00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:42,640
is a platform so to me a platform is a

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,410
set of software and possibly a set of

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,150
processes behind it that make promises

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,620
the system is making a promise to use

00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,050
the owner of the application that it

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,210
will deploy it for you hopefully it's

00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,510
also going to care for it for you and it

00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,610
will give you a view into how it's doing

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,030
just as input just as important as the

00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:06,250
promise itself are constraints because

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,220
constraints are actually what allow any

00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:12,850
platform to provide you with the service

00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:15,580
that it's promising that's a really

00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,230
important concept it also applies to the

00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,440
way we think about our development teams

00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,909
where the application teams the right

00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,680
constraints are going to free you

00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,010
they're going to free you to be creative

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,930
where it actually matters you shouldn't

00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,670
ask application development teams who

00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,350
are focusing on solving a real business

00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,030
problem to spend a lot of effort

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,220
thinking about how they're going to do

00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,780
log aggregation it might be interesting

00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,659
maybe they belong in your platform

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,640
operations team so constraints allow you

00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:44,650
to free up that team to focus and be

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,380
creative where it actually matters now

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,770
at platt foundry we have summarized our

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:54,040
promise in a haiku here is my source

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,799
code run it on the cloud for me I do not

00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,470
care how so I'll leave you with this

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,869
thought all of you have a platform for

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,140
your applications what promise is it

00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:08,590
making to you is it keeping that promise

00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,869
and are you taking full advantage of the

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,940
constraints in order to be creative

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,000
where it matters thanks

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,000
