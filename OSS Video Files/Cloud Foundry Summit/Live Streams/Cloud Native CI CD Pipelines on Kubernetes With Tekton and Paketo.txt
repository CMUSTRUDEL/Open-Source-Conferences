Description: 
	Kubernetes is the de facto infrastructure to which all modern application deployments are happening. Cloud Native technologies, which are closely tied in to Kubernetes, are replacing all traditional tools such as local dev, networking, monitoring, security, and everything else. 

Join us on this live stream where we explore Cloud Native CI/CD pipelines. This is the central piece of the DevOps toolchain and helps developers deploy with speed, at scale, and complete accuracy. Learn how to make use of Tekton, the standard tool for cloud native pipeline development, along with Paketo Buildpacks which simplify the creation of containers greatly.
