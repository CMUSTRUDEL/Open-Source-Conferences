Playlist: Live Streams
Description: 
	In this video, the co-chairs for the various CF Summit tracks get together to discuss what to expect from the upcoming Cloud Foundry Summit 2021.  Our expectation is that the panel discussion will give you an idea of what to expect in terms of the CFP screening process. We hope it is a great push in the direction of submitting your (inert) idea into a submission.
