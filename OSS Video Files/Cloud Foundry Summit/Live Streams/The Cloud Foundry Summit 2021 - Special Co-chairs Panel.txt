Description: 
	In this video, the co-chairs for the various CF Summit tracks get together to discuss what to expect from the upcoming Cloud Foundry Summit 2021.  Our expectation is that the panel discussion will give you an idea of what to expect in terms of the CFP screening process. We hope it is a great push in the direction of submitting your (inert) idea into a submission.

implemented on cloud foundry

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,160

to be here so great introductions

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,680
um i think it's safe to say that

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,759
everybody on the call is way more

cloud foundry so

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,160
it's just amazing um

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,680
so just some general information before

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
we dive into

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,440
some of the specifics the summit

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,000
is on the 21st and 22nd of july

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:29,039
2021 it's fully virtual

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,039
just like last year and

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,560
more important than that i think we need

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,919
to highlight that

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,599
the cfp closing date is on

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,759
friday the 21st of may so

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,520
don't forget that if you're watching uh

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,720
the big reason we're doing

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,560
this program is so that all of these

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
awesome technologies together can

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,680
inspire you to

cloud foundry

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,479
uh culminating in

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,400
shaping this event into what it is um in

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,840

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,960
that we're really looking forward to all

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,640
of the contributions

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:38,240
that you can give

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,279
so in terms of um

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,800
some of the specific stuff itself uh

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,839
let's maybe walk around

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,480
um once again uh one by one i guess

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,279
in some random order that shadrach will

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,880
pick

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:56,160
and get some specific insights into

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,600
what you all are looking for

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,440
in cfps so any topics that are of

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,399
particular interest to you

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
that you feel the community should

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,160
represent so

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,279
maybe start with james this time

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,279
completely random

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,720
oh yeah i can go first um so

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,120
this is not my first co-chairing of

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,880
track

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
at cf summit or other conferences and

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,320
every time i do one of these

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,360
uh we get way more submissions than

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:35,040
uh as humanly possible to sort through

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,440
i think two years ago um

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,720
mr vols and i had to go through like 200

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,920
and something

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,640
uh talk submissions and pick nine uh so

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,880
it's a you know

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,040
it's it's a good we get a good showing

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,040
what i look for most in the talk is put

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,040
together the putting together the track

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560
is to try and think of what the audience

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,040
is going to respond to

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,000
and and what will make for a good

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,880
experience

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
both for the speakers and for the the

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,279
the participants

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
it's a lot harder in a virtual

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,399
conference of course because

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
you don't always get to see all the

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,760
audience but usually i look for

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,120
a variety of engaging and illustrative

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,480
uh cfps so i'm the one i usually want to

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,560
find a couple of things that are just

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,000
weird and out there just to see

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,760
you know what happened so if you've got

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
a crazy idea and you're like ah they'll

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,279
never

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,839
ever ever accept this this proposal

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,720
submitted

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,120
go right now we'll pause the live stream

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,120
go

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,640
submit the weird talk because those are

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,880
some of the best talks

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,320
uh that the cfp chairs love to read we

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,279
love to watch them just to see you know

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,200
what happens and

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,200
the audience members really identify

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,440
awesome awesome thank you james

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,839
nodding the hardest so maybe you can go

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
next

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,800
who is nodding the hardest amelia

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,800
oh i thought it might have been you

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,720
deshawn

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,200
oh yes i love the out there talks i

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,680
think

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,519
my favorite talks that i see so i'm in

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,120
the behind the curtain track usually the

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,040
core contributors talking

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,560
project update's always great because

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,480
especially now that we're all working

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,640
remotely i'm not in an office anymore i

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,480
don't have casual interactions

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,800
with the other teams as much so i really

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
don't know what's going on outside of my

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,120
little bubble and so those are always

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,959
good

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,519
but i love the uh the stories about

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,480
the weird bugs that went wrong and how

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,839
you found them and

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,560
how you fixed them i think toby from the

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,720
uk

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,600
government did one maybe last year that

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,800
i loved

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,279
and he was talking about how like a

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,600
particular image

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,560
caused you like on a web page cause uaa

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
to have some

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,160
problem anyway they're they're out there

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,480
and they're just so interesting

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,160
uh to get in like a fun way to get into

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
the details of how everything

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,519
works rather than just like here's an

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,240
architecture diagram

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,240
so i love that

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,079
awesome awesome cut

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,800
yeah i i will look for energy uh

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,839
you know when trying to put together the

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,959
track uh i want to cover as many bases

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,360
as i can right there's this kind of path

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,880
that everybody has from dev to

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,839
production that developer experience i

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,040
want to understand

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,120
how like what did you do for your

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,399
organization and how did you do it so

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,680
i'm gonna try to like

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,279
yeah virtually pave that path with

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,959
the submissions that we get so we can

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,399
kind of cover some bases that

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,320
if somebody who's new to the cloud

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
foundry environment that ecosystem they

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,880
have some idea of what it looks like

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,880
from start to finish

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,240
nice nice um

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,600
chris do you want to give us your

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,000
insights

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,120
sure um well i'll speak somewhat

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,120
tangentially here

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,639
um since i'm not actually co-chairing a

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,800
track well

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,160
there are a few um some programming that

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,519
is extra cfp

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,920
uh so right now i'm putting together uh

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,680
some hands-on laps um which will be you

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,000
know technical walkthroughs so if people

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,160
are

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
a little bit tired of just passively

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,040
listening they can actually get their

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,079
hands dirty with um

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,959
with some some code um we've done this a

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,480
bunch of times

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,160
uh stark and wayne is kind enough to

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,440
help us out with the infrastructure and

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,920
which is built on gcp

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,360
and google is kind enough to donate us

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,920
some gcp credits

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,399
um so thanks to both those organizations

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,160
um

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,920
as of right now i believe we it looks

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,440
like we'll have a we'll we'll run our

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,839
the

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,639
uh creatively named tri-cloud foundry

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,720
hands-on lab

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,320
um like as we always do and probably

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,000
either ram or shed rackle

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,680
share that what are we gonna do in that

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
one chris

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,199
and uh they're i believe there'll be a

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,839
paquetto buildpax one that should be a

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,880
new one

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,480
and a one for cf for cates and then

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,160
something that stark and wayne will pick

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,920
up uh gbd

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,839
um so looking forward to all those this

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,440
should be a lot of fun um and then the

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,480
other thing that that i'll do

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,680
once we have the summit schedule set up

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,240
um then i i'll reach out to various uh

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,440
project leads uh on the different cloud

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,279
foundry project teams

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
and schedule office hours which are just

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,680
a drop in time that anyone can

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,240
can pop into and you know you have a

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,320
call with

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,920
the project leads for these or project

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,399
leads and or committers

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,760
uh for the various core projects and

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,600
then you have an opportunity to

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,600
you know ask direct questions in real

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,519
time to the folks that run those

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,720
so those those can be really great as

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,399
well um

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,000
so looking forward to all these and

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,680
certainly seeing what the

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,800
what the three tracks uh hook up for us

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:47,600
awesome thank you chris uh

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,600
next would be behind

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:59,360
well um the track behind the curtain

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:03,279
with emily amelia so i can add to

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,720
what she already said also

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,880
interesting uh discussion suggestions

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
around the future development of cloud

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,079
foundry

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,839
towards kubernetes i think

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:21,279
will be interesting for the community

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,399
or any interesting feature requests uh

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:28,240
we should want to discuss

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,240
or trigger discussion for

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:37,759
it's also it's always also cool

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,759
any issues you faced

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:45,839
on large deployments for example

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,839
at the cpu we have uh something in that

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,480
direction many issues in that direction

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,839
if

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,120
other south facing something towards

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,320
this thing could be also interesting

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,320
but yeah

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,759
awesome awesome thank you um who's

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,399
who has not gone yet uh pl spl okay mark

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,399
okay mark

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,800
what james said not just

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,759
[Laughter]

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,000
um i like to see eccentricity i like to

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,440
see

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,600
capabilities committed in the last few

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,279
years being used you know

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,199
surgical routing who's done anything

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,240
with that i love when it's

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,639
um one of those examples in your story

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
of

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,120
how you're doing something and someone

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,160
says to you god i didn't know you could

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,320
do that

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,360
um and how did you figure out what you

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,560
were you know that that particular trick

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,320
um you know i think that um

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,920
it could be of course a technical in the

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,639
weeds capability that you've surfaced

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,880
and used in some

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,399
useful way it could be an adjacency

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,160
decade there's a whole bunch of places

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,560
you can go with this but i think

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,160
something um i i forgot how you phrased

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,120
james but off the beaten track

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,000
eccentric you know eye grabbing as to oh

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,800
okay

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,320
um and most of us would know you've done

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,680
something a little bit you know unique

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,959
because you've never found a write-up on

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,440
it anywhere else and you kind of figure

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,160
that out

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,520
to begin with we're going to take that

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,839
into the wild metaphor as far as we can

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:17,439
exactly you got it yeah

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:20,000
let's hear it um yeah so

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,799
echoing off of what sean said i think

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,480
that like

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,640
diversity in topics um as well as

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,400
in levels of accessibility is really

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,720
important so not just

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,320
how to's for people who have been in

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
cloud foundry and have been contributors

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,120
and users for a long time but also for

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,960
new people because

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,799
i remember when i was new i really

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,240
appreciated the how to get started with

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,080
x tracks um and not just showing

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,440
a demo or not just showing something but

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,919
also really explaining

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,120
why is something important for people to

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,640
know i think that why

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,000
is the most important thing that i'll be

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,360
looking for personally when i look

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,400
through the proposals

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,799
um and so really pay attention to that

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,120
and

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,880
i'm looking forward to seeing some good

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,000
ideas

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,559
awesome thank you piali um ram

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,559
back to you

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,200
do i answer my own question or do i no

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,840
you don't

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,840
the new one okay so um

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,039
one of the things that i wanted to get

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,120
some feedback on was

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,840
there's different projects that the

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,960
foundation maintains and different

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,760
a lot of these get presented at the

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,080
summit

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,120
um just when you were answering the

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,919
previous um

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,760
question a lot of you mentioned you know

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,640
cf itself pacquiao

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,240
and then there's so many others so

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,039
anything in particular that you

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,039
look forward to

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,280
any any projects i mean that you

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:57,600
particularly look forward to

00:18:49,280 --> 00:19:00,240
being presented in your track this year

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,799
just feel free to unmute yourself and

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,919
answer

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,039
no problem um i'm won't necessarily be

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,039
in my track yet

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,480
but i'm interested in the cloud native

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,360
buildback shim

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,799
and how we're going to get to

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,400
convergence with cmbs

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,880
outside the platform outside cloud

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,160
foundry from a runtime perspective

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,960
so that'll be interesting just to see

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,960
how that's coming along

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
thanks

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,000
well my favorite domain is of course

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,400
networking and so

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,760
i know that there's some some engineers

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,880
who have been working hard on adding

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,160
http 2 to the system and

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,240
it's provided a lot of really

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,919
interesting technical challenges that

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,000
they've been overcoming and so

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,240
i'm really excited to hear them speak on

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,240
that

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,720
if i can convince them to submit a cfp

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,120
should

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,120
uh who's next what's going next should i

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,320
call names

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,320
i'm happy to call names

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,640
okay james let's see her

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,840
i mean echo mark sentiments right the

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,159
end of the wild track

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,080
really is about people using cloud

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,120
foundry in any way

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,200
uh in the real world uh doing

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,720
large scale deployments solving actual

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,159
real world problems like

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
we're not talking i don't want to see a

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,240
demo of spring music deployed

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,039
3 000 times although i do believe that

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,840
is the

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,720
the base demo for cloud foundry um i

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,400
want to see

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,480
a whole bunch of things but mostly what

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,960
i want to see from a variety standpoint

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,080
is

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,919
big and small a lot of years we get the

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,039
like oh i have a massive

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,600
6 000 diego cell cluster and i can

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,400
deploy

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,440
30 million app instances i want to see

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,080
the company

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,919
that's a startup and how are they using

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,600
cloud foundry and what kinds of problems

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,120
are they having and what are they

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,919
solving how are they solving those

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,679
problems because

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,039
i think cloud foundry can work on the

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,799
smaller end of the spectrum

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,559
uh in my day job at stark and wayne we

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,919
help a lot of smallish

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,840
enterprises i mean they're still

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,159
enterprises but the smaller end of the

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,280
spectrum with you know only a handful of

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,200
apps that still

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,880
that get value out of this i'd like to

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,440
see that

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,280
out in public that where we can talk

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,960
about it not under nda and not

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,640
in you know client relationships and all

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,039
that but just what did you do

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,640
and and how good was it was it was was

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,880
the cf push story helpful

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,320
to small shops as it is to large shops

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,559
yeah i think i think that usually i

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,720
agree with james um you know

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,559
being a developer advocate at the um cf

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,280
at the california foundation it's all

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,720
one of our places a job to make sure

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,559
that we get like small

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,080
teams to share stories from small teams

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,960
like also advocates for them to make

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,480
sure that they have

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
you know every single thing they need to

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,559
get started with cf and um

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,720
answer certain questions so i totally

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,520
feel what james just said now

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,159
um thank you james for that um who else

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,320
has

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,600
anything to say um that sean do you have

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,919
something you want to share

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,960
i have all the feelings right this is uh

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,280
already i'm excited

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,640
about uh what i'm hearing uh and excited

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,120
to see some of these submissions

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,840
but that story you know beginning to end

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,159
it you know

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,039
having accessibility for different

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,600
levels

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,120
of maturity uh i definitely care about

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,840
like even like the symbol problems you

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,120
know one that's

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,760
uh fairly recent with me is uh logging

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,600
like how are people handling logging

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,000
yeah how are you keeping them around

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,960
how are you handling loss and scale uh

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,360
just

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,120
there's so many topics to cover and and

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,400
everybody's got a story every guide

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,919
everybody has a story that

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,240
that's been interesting and exciting

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,760
over the past uh nine to 12 months

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,200
uh you know new technologies being

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,240
released how did you leverage that

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,360
awesome awesome exactly uh

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,400
anybody else um

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,559
i think i'm also particularly interested

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,320
in the services story personally because

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,080
i think that cloud foundry in general is

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,080
like really focused on apps typically

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,000
like i've seen a lot of talks about like

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,600
focusing on networking security mostly

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,280
around apps but i really want to

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,360
understand more of this story like the

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,600
full story between apps and services

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,559
how are they connected how do you like

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,720
from day one

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,159
how do you even make a service instance

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,919
for example how do you even connect it

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,240
to your app how do you monitor that

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,679
what's the highly availability story

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,159
around that how do you

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,039
accomplish that so i think that that

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,400
story would be really

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,159
amazing to share um especially because

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,320
there have been a lot of learnings

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,720
recently around that so i'm really

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:36,320
um interested in seeing some proposals

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,840
in that area

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,000
just carrying on from something to sean

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,200
said the logging so in my you know this

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,400
week i found something new inside

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,240
foundry last year i discovered the

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,080
rainer script support

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,760
really interesting you know you can

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,360
create filtered log streams out of cloud

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,720
foundry and i thought wow what could we

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,559
do with that

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,919
um so if anyone's done anything

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,520
interesting there that's one i'd be

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,960
fascinated by because it ties into a

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,360
whole security story that's very

00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,360
interesting

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,559
yeah yeah

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,559
thank you mark um ram

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,720
do folks have any

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,000
very memorable talks from previous

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,320
summits

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,880
something that you really enjoyed and

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,000
that might illustrate

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,960
how how to think about you know

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,080
talks for the future just something that

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,640
you've heard in the past and you've

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,320
really enjoyed

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,840
yeah i think i think pialy should have

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,600
some because she said you know the whole

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,880
get inside thing was easy for her

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,640
because somebody talks

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,000
so pr do you have any memorable talk

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,120
that you think

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,360
um you want to talk about yeah um

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,279
actually the very first talk that i've

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,360
ever seen and this was before i even

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,080
joined pivotal this was when i was still

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,600
searching for something to join and one

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,120
of the reasons why i applied to pivotal

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,559
in the first place and was interested in

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,600
cloud foundry was because

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,720
i saw a cf summit talk by eric mom about

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,799
diego

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,919
and this was like a few years ago maybe

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,440
like three or four years ago i don't

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,720
remember but i just remember what struck

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,880
me the most was that

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,960
diego bosh like those are pretty

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,039
complicated topics for someone who's

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,679
never even seen cloud boundary before

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,080
or is completely new to the field and i

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,279
really

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,600
appreciated the way that eric broke such

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,559
a complex topic and workflow down into

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,799
something that's so

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,480
understandable even for a complete new

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,720
beginner person like me

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,320
and at the same time the content itself

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,400
was still pretty heavy

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,000
and pretty complicated but i didn't walk

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,520
into it or walk out of it feeling like

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,840
oh what did i just learn

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,279
i i felt like oh wow i think i did gain

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,760
something from this i think i do

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,520
understand the gist of this and there's

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,320
and it really interested me in learning

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,159
more

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,919
so i think that those types of talks are

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,279
the most impactful like even if you're

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,440
talking about something that's

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,640
super highly technical how do you make

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,240
that accessible

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,600
to someone who's new or how do you make

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,960
that accessible to somebody who's

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,520
exploring the area

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,679
and presented in such a way to make them

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,039
want to learn more

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,200
awesome awesome thank you um piali shout

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,840
out to eric for that talk

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,880
um hey sean do you want to say something

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,840
yeah i'll just add

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,320
that whole idea of uh doesn't matter the

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,960
kind of

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,000
maturity of the conversation but if you

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,520
can be like eric

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,520
and you can bring people into the

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,600
conversation into a depth

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,799
conversation and make yourself

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,360
understood

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,000
that's huge right so if we can get from

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,400
your

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,679
uh submission if we can see that you

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,240
understand it and that you're presenting

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,960
in a way

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,559
that can be easily consumed by all

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,080
levels of maturity in the audience

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,240
that'll be a big plus awesome awesome

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,600
now i want now i want to be like eric i

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,640
don't know if eric is watching this but

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,760
are you going to be watching this

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,520
character

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,080
if you're watching this you take menses

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,440
i will be in your slack

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,919
okay okay um

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,400
um experience a talk experience they

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,400
want to share

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,240
james do you have any

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,000
i have two i was actually just

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,679
frantically googling to figure out which

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,840
which one of the the gens that

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,279
demandbridge did this talk but

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,559
we had uh one of our customers the

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,440
circuit wayne is demandbridge they're a

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,760
small

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,600
smallish marketing firm they do all of

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,360
their stuff is built and deployed on top

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,720
of cloud foundry and they're an example

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,480
of what i was talking about that lower

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,240
end spectrum

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,000
we're not talking 2 000 developers we're

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,480
talking like three

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,520
and they are able to get so much out of

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,440
it and they talk about

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,120
what cloud foundry meant to them as a

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,600
small operator

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,799
and kind of the the foibles that they

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,600
had getting started

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,919
the cost thing and a bunch of those and

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,840
that

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,279
that to me if i could get more talks

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,520
like that

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,760
i would be happy with the schedule uh

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,760
for cf summit 2021

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,679
and on the opposite end of the spectrum

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,799
a good friend of mine matt serabian from

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,360
zipcar

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,159
gave a talk i want to say three years

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,080
ago

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,080
about secure introduction with vault

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,399
inside of cloud foundry applications

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,120
where he goes through this complete zero

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,679
trust model for secrets introduction

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,880
uh for things like databases from

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,080
applications and it was

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:13,520
incredibly dense material that

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,320
he just so lively presented

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,039
that a whole bunch of people uh got

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,679
really excited about security

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,240
uh and and for people to get really

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,039
excited about security

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,640
uh takes us that's that's a that's

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,480
impressive i'd like to i love when

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,679
people get excited not just about the

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,480
thing they saw but about the

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,840
the doors that it opens in their own

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,840
journeys and what they're doing with the

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,039
technology

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,200
awesome awesome awesome

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,840
anybody else before we move on to the

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,840
next thing

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,720
chris okay behind okay

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,200
i always enjoyed the talks given by dr

jules

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,600
from ibm they are really entertaining

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,440
and also the content is present very

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,360
well so that you can understand

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:10,159
also really complex topics around

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:14,880
gardener or diego in a funny way

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:18,880
this is something uh which is really uh

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,880
nice to see in a conference

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,279
awesome uh these are very interesting

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,440
takeaways

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,279
for um those watching and those

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,720
interested in

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,279
um thinking through their cfp so go back

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,000
watch

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,600
some of the old talks very interesting

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,039
honorable mentions

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,279
here by a lot of folks but also remember

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,200
you might be inspiring other pleas out

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,399
there to join

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,440
cf so yeah

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,440
just putting it out there

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,440
anyone else have any other talks they

00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:00,399
want to mention

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:03,520
before we move on going once then twice

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:06,720
okay i am going to

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,480
ask something

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,600
rather controversial um cf summit

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,799
is predominantly

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,240
targeted towards engineers and that

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:23,840
you know engineering persona but

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,840
how technical do you think a cfp

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,480
submission should be

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,279
um is there scope for you know

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,159
tangential

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,760
non-technical discussions um is there

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,760
scope for

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,880
something like you know how business

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,919
outcomes

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,840
could should would be affected by cf how

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,840
um you know other

00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:50,799
non-web application non

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,159
you know associated services is there a

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,520
13th factor

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:59,039
is my question really um

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,240
um you know floors open for anybody who

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,919
has an opinion

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,240
rahm are you asking us to give away the

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,120
the secret code of the co-chairs on how

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,120
we select talks

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,200
let's just see something like that but

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,200
not like that if there is one

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,000
yeah i can't actually discuss that but

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,559
what i can tell you is when i

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,320
do my talk selection i usually figure

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,679
out hey how many slots there are

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,600
because you do have to fit into the

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,320
schedule and then i like to

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,840
divide that number into subtract one

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,000
divided by three

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,880
and the one that i subtract that's my

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,440
wild card

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,039
and i'm looking for just the weird like

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,399
what are people gonna remember even if

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,240
it wasn't

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,919
you know a hundred percent on and it can

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,880
be technical it can be business it can

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,679
be whatever

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,440
and then the other three silos bins

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,840
buckets whatever you want to call them

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,720
one of them is for hard tech stuff one

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,760
of them is for

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,720
business process like improving

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,919
developer productivity or or reducing

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,240
infrastructure spend

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,919
those kind now we call that fintech or

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,000
fin-ops

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,360
that we're doing finops years ago at cf

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,039
summit um

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,880
you heard it here first and then the

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,919
third one i i reserved for like the

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,880
social

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,080
um i don't want to call them soft skills

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,320
because i think that's a disservice

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,519
to how much how difficult it is to to

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,080
talk about the

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,039
the non-technical non-computer binary

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,200
stuff but like

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,399
how do you as a developer feel using

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,720
cloud foundry

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,559
uh how has it changed the way you write

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,080
code how has it affected architecture

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,440
those kinds of

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,519
of talks make really good talks

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,919
uh and i have a hard time when i when i

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,519
try and shop cfps around to people like

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,760
when i'm trying to sell people on

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,120
submitting cfps everyone's like oh you

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,399
know i did this one thing and

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,480
that might be interesting i could do a

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,640
demo of that it's like yeah but remember

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,840
when you used to have you know you had

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,760
two people on your team

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,440
and you could only push like three apps

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,880
a day and now you've got four people and

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,559
you're pushing a hundred

00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,080
like that's big let's talk about that

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,159
that's that's kind of how i i don't

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,440
normally ever hit those numbers exactly

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,120
but that's kind of

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,360
the mix-up that i like to see because it

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,840
gives you some variety and it's not just

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,840
wall-to-wall brain drain tech talks

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,760
um i think one thing i can share about

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,919
like what i'm looking for

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,039
for the how to track specifically is and

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,960
maybe this is the

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,559
product manager side of me talking but

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,880
like even if it's a very

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,159
technical or engineering heavy a demo

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,279
that you're trying to do or how to that

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,919
you're trying to discuss

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,919
i think keeping the end user in mind and

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,440
like who is this how-to for who's

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,440
actually going to be

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,200
doing this in the real world what is the

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,360
impact of this workflow

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,240
i think that that is so important to

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,640
communicate

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,679
even if the room is full of developers i

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,960
think it's still important to

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,039
communicate that because i think that's

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,880
something that everyone can connect to

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,720
and it makes that so much more

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,960
meaningful to share

00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,799
so end users always keep them in mind

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,000
you know one of my favorites ever was

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,760
actually at a spring conference but it

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,159
was about cloud foundry and it was uh

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,840
liberty mutual talking about getting to

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,280
production in 10 minutes in a 100 year

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,359
old insurance company

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,919
and almost all of the conversation of

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,440
the talk track was about outward facing

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,520
and how leveraging cloud foundry and

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,359
what it meant for them to be able to

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,240
attest and be able to get past all those

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,760
gates

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,720
um and he basically described

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,800
you know so much of his universe outward

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,320
facing from the cloud foundry view as

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,520
opposed to inward facing and what he was

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,200
doing to set it up

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,560
and it was very high level it was

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,679
actually a really really interesting

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,760
talk so

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,960
um and it doesn't have to be some

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,079
company that size if

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,480
i it but the the outcome you know when

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,320
they

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,839
they get that right and the lightning

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,159
hits they're just really really cool to

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,839
see

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,399
it's a a three-person company or a 3000

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,919
engineer

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,599
company uh whether it's technical or not

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,160
there's there's always going to be some

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,119
level of emotion like when i'm writing

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,320
a presentation or an abstract uh what's

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,200
the emotion what's the thing that's

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,280
going to connect

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,640
uh you know as mark just started talking

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,640
i think about all of those

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,839
uh sessions that i watched and it

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,680
touched me my heart

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,200
right being a fan of the product and

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,079
seeing how i get goosebumps

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,800
uh thinking about all the ways that this

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,200
ecosystem

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,240
has allowed us to do more exciting

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,119
things

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,240
faster more secure all of those emotions

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,760
that sometimes we kind of take for

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,200
granted sometimes it's it's nice to

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,640
restate the obvious

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,599
right a lot of people don't understand

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,520
how easy a cf push can be

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,960
right we've kind of taken well i know

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,480
i've taken it for granted

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,160
uh the the level of ease

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,160
that experience that i have and the

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,240
excitement about delivering

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,520
to production to our customers and

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,320
getting that feedback shorten that

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
feedback loop

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,599
all those things that sometimes we take

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,560
for granted uh sometimes it can be

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,720
really exciting

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,839
if you're showing it to somebody that's

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,839
never seen it before

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,119
it's definitely a good nutrition

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,880
definitely

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,880
um anybody else i want to go

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,960
okay going one

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,320
okay wrong yeah i i want to bring

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,800
um bring up something um

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,839
again slightly more tangential and i'm

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,000
going to go with

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,680
behan because he's been the quietest one

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,119
so far

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,119
in in comparison so

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,640
because this event is virtual and that

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,520
can be a challenge for like a lot of

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,880
folks

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,200
any thoughts you want to share about

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,560
what can be particularly difficult

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,440
especially if you're a first time

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,680
presenter

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,640
at a virtual event as opposed to you

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,119
know it being a physical event

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,640
and i and the reason i want to bring

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,760
this up is

00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,119
for the foreseeable future a lot of the

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,680
events for very good reason um seem to

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,640
want to

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,800
continue on this virtual mode so

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,560
although i'm

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,960
you know i'm really hoping that you know

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,320
everything goes back to the way it was

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,040
i don't want to use the n word normal

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,160
word

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,000
but um i'm

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,160
you know really hoping that you know we

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,079
can go back to doing the

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,920
events in person but virtual events can

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,800
be challenging and so i just wanted to

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,320
get some folks

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,320
thoughts on on that

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,280
um what i because i think is

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,280
more difficult is to

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:47,599
do the recording for the event uh

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,079
usually it's taking much more time than

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,720
you

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:56,079
think it will take and you

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,880
always can improve it and draw a new one

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,520
a new one

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,079
and at some point you have to give up

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,079
and say

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:07,200
this is yeah this is the one

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:11,359
and be happy with you

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,359
uh yeah this was uh

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,359
my challenge when i did it for the first

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,880
time for virtual conference

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,440
to get the recording done in the times

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,280
what i

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,839
i actually planned for it uh it was

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,839
a challenge

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,760
awesome yeah i totally agree with um

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,240
beyond i mean i've done a lot of talks

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,760
in within um the side of the pandemic

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,400
and now and one thing i've always had

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,640
issues with

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,680
is you know recording the talk you know

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,760
you you you

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,599
let me say you are you find out various

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,079
um errors for example you did not turn

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,160
on your

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,440
audio and you record about 30 minutes of

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,520
your um

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,880
of your talk so there's always that

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,880
there's also you know

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,880
uh making certain mistakes missing the

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,280
points and going back to do it so

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,119
um the best way to do to actually record

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,560
videos the best way to actually record

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,839
videos is to

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,359
um have a script so draw a map okay this

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,960
is where i want to start from this is

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,760
where i want to get to and this is how

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,280
i'm going to do it so having a visual

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,720
representation of your entire talk is

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,680
going to be very easy for you to not

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,320
make mistakes

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,880
and have a very very at least almost

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,359
perfect

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,040
talk so having a script for your talk is

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,720
actually very important and very

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,200
um useful when you are recording your

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,000
virtual talk so that's sort of like

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,760
what our advice personally if you on one

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,880
if you submit a talk and you accept it

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,280
and you want to record the talk you

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,359
should

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,040
definitely keep that in mind unless

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,280
you're like an expert or a pro

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,640
that has been doing this for a while so

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,400
that's um one way

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,839
i feel like you can actually make your

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,839
talks better

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,160
so is anybody else that's willing to

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,480
answer the same question that

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,599
behind myself has answered you know from

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,960
your experience

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,800
i think i feel like james is going to

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,680
have a lot of like experience with this

00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,640
i feel like

00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,200
i i will say that uh the virtual event

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,280
thing has been a blessing and a curse

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,520
uh the blessing being that i i don't

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,720
have to pack a suitcase to go to a

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,760
conference

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,839
uh the curse being that as as a

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,440
veteran presenter at conferences making

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,359
the switch to virtual

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,200
if you haven't done that already and you

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,400
have spoken at conferences in the past

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,440
it's a very different feel

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,760
for starters you don't have an audience

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,800
to

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,720
interact with you can't make eye contact

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,800
with people in the audience to see are

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,119
they getting this are

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,800
am i off in the weeds not explaining

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,440
myself do i need to slow down

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,079
speed up is everyone asleep the only

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,520
person you

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,240
have to look at is yourself and that's

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,280
also

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,079
really weird and i do a lot of live

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,760
events down i've gotten used to it

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,680
but but that's one of the biggest

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,359
weirdnesses about presenting and it's

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,200
something you can you know it's weird at

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,240
first you'll get into the groove

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,200
uh and then and it goes away but i see

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,359
desean uh

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,720
is shaking his head vigorously i'm

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,319
thinking of all these things

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,000
all this knowledge that we're kind of

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,800
sharing out to the world and yeah

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,440
i'm agreeing i'm nodding i i'm kind of

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,680
awkward

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,640
uh and i like this i like this uh

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,480
virtual approach

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,960
i like that i can go in and edit when

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,480
i'm done oh i missed it on that take

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,160
let me go back and just say that one

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,040
little bit that i missed in

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,760
uh flashbang and and now it's it's back

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,839
in my

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,440
my presentation so yeah there's all

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,599
these there's benefits

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,200
right and and depending on your your

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,720
skill level and your comfort level

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,040
uh yeah you've got a little bit of

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,359
flexibility uh i like to grab somebody

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,240
and

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,640
bring them in the room when i'm

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,440
recording or have somebody watch

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,720
uh on the phone uh while i'm going like

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,079
hey did that feel right

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,000
because i do i want to share the emotion

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,599
i want i want to be able to share

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,200
the goosebumps moments i want to be able

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,160
to get that out it's going to be hard to

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,079
see that

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,000
in in the call for papers and the

00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,359
submissions uh so i'm going to be

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,839
looking i'm going to try to

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,640
to feel that emotion but yeah there's

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,680
lots of these

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,800
tips and i hope i hope hope hope that

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,119
what we're providing here is that

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,880
entry uh it's okay if this is your first

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,000
time presenting at a conference

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,880
right don't be afraid to present and you

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,319
have a little bit of

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,000
leeway you have a little flexibility on

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,760
this one i want to hear

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,520
i want to hear from that community so if

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,880
you're maybe a computer science student

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,800
that just got done taking

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,480
uh your ap tests and you have been

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,560
introduced to cloud boundary and

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,599
you want to understand share share what

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,520
you've learned

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,160
so far that would be awesome

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,880
awesome awesome um so one more question

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,000
from my end

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,040
um so what um what advice

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,200
to um do you all have for like

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,160
first-time speakers i know like we're

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,640
encouraging like

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,599
more people to submit and of course the

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,960
first timers

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,880
i mean a lot of people are actually

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,359
looking into i'm sharing their knowledge

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,200
and

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,280
some of them back out because of the

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,520
fact that they are intimidated by maybe

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,200
the

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,960
line-up scene like people with a lot of

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,640
experience and speaking and they don't

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,520
just feel confident enough or feel like

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,920
their talk

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,200
is going to you know be accepted in the

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,960
cf summit so

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,880
um what advice does like do you

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,400
folks have for um first time are

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,160
submitting their first talk to the cf

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,640
summit

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,520
um i can i can speak to this a little

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,200
bit the first

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,040
talk that i gave was actually my first

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,359
year when i joined pivotal

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,880
um and that was really nerve-wracking

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,560
for me in a lot of ways because i

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,560
first of all never given a talk in a

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,640
conference in general before and i also

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,480
just joined pivotal at that point and i

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,160
i'm like do i even know enough about

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,200
cloud foundry to be giving a talk i

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,280
don't know

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,319
um but i think like i was so grateful

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,400
because my

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,920
co-workers really encouraged me to

00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,720
submit the proposal because they were

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,319
like if you

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,160
don't submit the proposal then you don't

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,599
have a chance to even get it accepted in

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,119
the first place so it's better than the

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,640
zero percent chance

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,960
and i think that really stuck with me

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,280
because you don't know until you try

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,040
and i i'm really grateful that i did

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,599
because even though i was extremely

00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,640
nervous

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,119
before going up the actual conference

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,960
i think a lot of my nerves went away

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,319
when i started interacting with the

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,000
audience and i started seeing all the

00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,440
faces and being like wait these people

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,680
are actually interested in what i'm

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,319
talking about that's amazing

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,240
and i think that's really a real thing

00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,359
that's that happens as even in a virtual

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,200
conference because

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,960
just remember that if your talk does get

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,480
accepted there's a reason why it got

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,160
accepted and

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,480
it's because we strongly believe that

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,480
it's going to be valuable

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,680
and impact the community and a lot of

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,800
people who are really interested in what

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,880
you have to say

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,240
so definitely submit an idea even if

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,839
you're new definitely submit the

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,640
proposal because

00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,760
it's a really really great way to share

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,359
your ideas

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,800
and you have to get started at some

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,839
point so

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,920
good luck yeah thank you so much for

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,680
that priority i

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,680
definitely agree with you because that

00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,520
was how that was how

00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,960
basically it was when i first gave my

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,760
mind when i gave my first talk for the

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,680
first time

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,680
um it was really i was shaking when i

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,040
clicked on confirm like so me that was

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,560
literally shaking i was like

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,160
um these people are really going to know

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,200
how much of a fraud i am

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,920
whenever this this stock has been

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,839
accepted

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,920
so it was i was shaking but at the end

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,240
of the day when i actually got

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,599
to the venue to give the talk seeing

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,839
like a bunch of people

00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,119
like peace games take pay and putting

00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,560
all your attention on me

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,800
really really made me comfortable i'm

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,720
like okay so these people really want to

00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,720
listen to what i have to say

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,160
i mean that that alone was like really

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,160
really comforting and

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,599
i think um i think it was so it was

00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,000
successful that my first talk was really

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,000
really

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,319
successful so i mean you can never know

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,720
until you do it like p.m please said so

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,400
just

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,000
you know just click on submit click on

00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,960
finish your talk click on it and you

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
know submit

00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,839
what's the worst that could happen um

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,839
so who else has like i needed to share

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,240
on this particular question i asked

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,280
i just wrote um you know you're there to

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,800
tell a story

00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,720
think of it as storytelling well we say

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,640
you rehearse and write your script

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,839
don't put your script on your slides

00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,920
keep them

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,520
go to demo keep your slides as we're as

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,880
low in word count as you can because

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,400
it's not a handout

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,480
it's really just a few markers to keep

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,319
you on a track um

00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,319
you know you're you're there just to

00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,000
have a you know kind of a one-person

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,520
conversation with the audience and just

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,200
tell them what you went through

00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,119
and it's a journey story the best ones

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,240
always turn into i started here i ended

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,920
there and here's what we managed to

00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,440
discover along the way

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,240
but um you know it's the standard

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,640
presentation tricks of the trade

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,000
um completely agreed there's there's no

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,280
there's no substitute for getting

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,680
out there i personally hate

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,880
pre-recording because i find that i need

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,480
that feedback

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,760
and it kills me and i do a bunch of

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,359
takes and i hate every one of them when

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,480
i listen to my self-talk it just kills

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,599
me still dead

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,200
so don't feel bad if that happens to you

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,079
and it's it's not to say you must go

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,839
live but um yeah it just

00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,200
it you know it sounds almost cliche but

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,920
if you just be yourself having a chat

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,440
about it

00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,079
that's the best flavor the most natural

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,400
feeling i think that comes out

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,359
awesome the the the piece of advice i

00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,359
always give new

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,880
new speakers either before they've

00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,480
decided yeah i'm actually going to try

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,560
and submit to the cfp or

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,760
after when they've gotten the acceptance

00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,040
another you know

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:13,119
all nerves and butterflies the audience

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,960
isn't required to go to the conference

00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,560
right this is a it's a three-track

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,480
conference so if you've got a ticket you

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,960
have two other options to go to

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,839
they are in your room because they want

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,160
to hear you

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,079
speak and more importantly they want to

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,280
have a good time

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,960
uh most people like 99.9

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,880
people don't go to talks to heckle the

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,520
speaker even though that's the 100

00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,720
percent

00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,319
fear even seasoned speakers have

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,319
so if you're if you're thinking about it

00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,920
like i think i could talk to this topic

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,800
or i think i have an interesting story

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,200
to tell

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,040
um just keep in mind the audience also

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,480
wants to have a good time so so they're

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,680
gonna cut you some slack and

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,880
most of the things that you're gonna

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,000
worry about and that you're gonna you're

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,319
gonna get off stage

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,680
or close out the live stream and go oh i

00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,680
said this wrong and i said that wrong

00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,240
nobody's gonna notice because everybody

00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,520
was there to have a good time

00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:07,359
saki you think

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:12,160
james anybody else okay

00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:16,319
mom so i'm going to

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:19,359
spend the next few minutes in

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:21,119
testing the memory of our panelists now

00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,880
now that it's been established that you

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,480
folks have been in the community for a

00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,280
while

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,440
i know for a fact that he remembers

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,880
every single one of them going back to

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,040

00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:55,040
[Music]

00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:55,040
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:06,800
i got this one 2020 was both remote

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,800
2019 philadelphia and

00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,240
18 boston and basil

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,960
uno was 17 boston oh no i'm not sure

00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,000

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,720
it was also basel we did basel two years

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,839
in a row which was which was great

00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:36,559
um and before boston was it

00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:39,920
santa clara oh i think

00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,200
we did santa claus in 2016.

00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,839
unless we did a two years interview we

00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,800
do two because we had the mall of

00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,839
america's one year and then they moved

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,440
the venue

00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,440
i think we did do santa clara twice

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,960
nice

00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,280
when it was one room with like a folding

00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,960
table with one coffee pot on it

00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,760
like seven people showed up that was

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,760
2014.

00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,040
it was sanitary it wasn't san francisco

00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,559
okay

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,559
memories are blurred going that far back

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,839
yeah i remember i took the train down

00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,599
from san francisco to santa clara

00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,880
and i remember first hearing it as santa

00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,319
barbara and i was like this is going to

00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,040
be great and then i heard santa clara

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:27,839

00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,520
in

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,960
berlin but that was before i joined um

00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,240
the first one i went to was frankfort

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,760
which was great

00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,599
but i'd only been with the foundation

00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,520

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,280
