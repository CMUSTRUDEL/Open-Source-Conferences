Title: Small Teams Making a Big Impact â€“ GOV.UK PaaS
Publication date: 2021-06-09
Playlist: Live Streams
Description: 
	Join our live stream to learn about the Cloud Foundry-based PaaS service that powers digital applications as part of the Cabinet Office Government Digital Service. 

In this stream, we have an opportunity to take a deep-dive into the operations behind a government-scale Cloud Foundry deployment. We have representatives from the GOV.UK PaaS team who will be sharing some stories of how they keep digital system afloat for hundreds of departments and thousands of applications. Different needs, varying deadlines, diverse languages and frameworks, all supported by a single GOV.UK PaaS running Cloud Foundry. 

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the whole operation is the size of their team and how they are able to extract immense efficiency, thanks to mature management practices aided by the right technology choices. 

Join us to learn all about it. It is an opportunity to interact openly with the folks who are making this possible. Software engineering teams of all types belonging to companies of all sizes are sure to benefit from the takeaways!

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,960
who chooses to remain anonymous

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,200
rafael is a senior developer i think

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,600
yeah as a senior developer he got the uk

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,320
pass

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,520
and he will be accompanying uh mark to

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,799
like talk about how

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,040
cf is inspiring their team so um

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,159
over to ram take it over

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,680
hey everybody

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,720
good morning good afternoon good evening

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,320
to you you all because

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,159
you know people are joining us from

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,920
different parts of the world

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,439
and a good day to those who will be

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,960
viewing the stream

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,960
in retrospect so

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,960
we have a one guest with us here today

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,439
mark buckley from the cuff dot uk has

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,640
team

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,840
and joining him is rafael

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
and he is a senior developer also on the

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
gov

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,120
uk as team so they go by

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,720
at gds team on twitter

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,360
and obviously the main reason we have

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,360
them

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,560
uh here today with us is because they're

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,760
like users of cloud foundry

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,280
but i think the bigger story here that

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,720
we're here to

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,120
sort of share with all of you is

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:45,440
how they're able to

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,840
envision and and build and provision

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,440
all of these wonderful government

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,599
initiatives and

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
they're able to make like a massive

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,440
impact with

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,680
a significantly small team so as i was

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,599
digging into doing some research about

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,680
how big their team is how many apps they

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,920
own and things like that

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,959
it's actually a fairly small team that

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,720
supports like a

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,400
huge spectrum of applications

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,480
across several departments across

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,760
several verticals that do like so many

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
different things

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,720
so i was very curious about that story i

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,760
was very impressed by that

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,640
story after i heard it and so um

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,360
i think it was only you know real for us

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,720
to

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,040
share all of that with all of you and so

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,720
that's what brings us here today and

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,680
rather than hear it from me let's

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,560
um hear it from uh mark and the other

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,720
folks

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,519
themselves welcome mark uh do you want

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,360
to just introduce yourself very quickly

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,159
sure thanks ram thanks shadrach for the

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,480
introductions my name is mark buckley um

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,959
i

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,239
am a product manager on gov dot uk

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,120
platform as a service

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,840
or we've got uk has really like to

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,640
abbreviate

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,640
it to uh rafale want to come in from the

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,599
shadows

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,720
sure um my name is rafael i'm a senior

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,840
developer on the gothic

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,280
past um yeah and

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,280
we'll just take it from here i suppose

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:17,040
great stuff um so

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,639
ram uh what would you uh best like i

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,239
mean i've got some i've got some slides

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,600
that i can kind of present to give a bit

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,720
of an overview

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,840
um so if uh if that's okay then i will

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,840
just

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
uh

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:43,840
i think that's a perfect

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,320
okay so hopefully uh you're able to

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,320
see my screen got that uk and as we're

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,199
talking about small teams making a big

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,639
impact

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,639
i thought that would be an appropriate

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,680
thing to label

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,680
the presentation

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,360
uh as um so

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,639
before i kind of get into platform as a

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,919
service it's probably

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,400
important to give a bit of kind of

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,759
context as to um

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,039
well what government uk is and where

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,240
rafael and i work

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,000
so rafael and i are uh

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,160
working in government digital service or

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,680
gds which is part of the

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:40,320
uk government um it's been around since

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,759
sort of the early 2010s i think 2012

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,960
and the sort of initial

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,560
program of works i suppose that was

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,240
created back then was the consolidation

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,000
and migration of

00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:00,080
uh a whole plethora of myriad of

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,319
um websites and consolidated them

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,880
into the one website that we know today

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,400
as gov.uk

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,120
just to put this sort of scale of that

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,199
into kind of perspective

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,120
i think there are around 900 websites

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,840
ultimately consolidated

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,759
um into what is gov uk

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,360
now um off the

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,680
off the back i suppose of uh of that

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,400
work and because of that success

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,400
um the

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
digital strategy around transforming

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,720
government to enable

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,280
citizens to interact digitally with

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,280
government was kind of enabled

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,560
and the next thing or one of the next

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,240
things was what

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,520
we refer to as government as a platform

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,280
so government as a platform or gaap

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:59,120
as we're also fond of abbreviating it

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,960
was kind of started around 2015

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,360
and comprises the products that

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,880
you see on the screen at the moment so

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,960
good.uk notify

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:14,840
our notifications platform uh wk pay

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,919
which is a payments um interface

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:22,080
and uh products that allows

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:24,479
citizens to pay um online

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,440
uk that i'll be talking about

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,000
extensively

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,000
and the uk design system that

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,639
essentially is the

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
front end and kind of an on-brand user

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,280
experience

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,560
that government services in the uk

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,680
um all adhere to

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,319
um we decided to embark on

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,240
sort of these products we did a lot of

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,120
user research around what would be most

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,720
beneficial

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,800
to government departments

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,879
to know what essentially what were the

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,080
things that their

00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,919
different government departments of

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,160
different arms are

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,759
doing time and time again they're

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,479
they're all these kind of things so

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,840
they're they're having to send um emails

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,759
and notifications about

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,319
um potential services and things like

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,599
that they're having to procure payment

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,319
platforms um

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,120
and in order to be under the ecommerce

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,800
uh

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,800
as part of the cloud

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,280
strategy or cloud first strategy that

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,319
was implemented around 2015

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,080
then procuring hosting

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,520
and designing for websites and things

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,640
itself so

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:39,680
gds decided to centralize all this

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:42,320
um and as such uh enables sort of those

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,279
efficiencies and benefits across the

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,920
public sector

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,040
by addressing these issues once in a

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,720
central way and

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,360
commoditizing it then

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,959
services across government can then use

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,640
these components

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,839
to quickly uh safely securely uh

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,040
create services that have a great user

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,839
experience

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,800
um so that's just sort of a background

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:14,320
to the historical context of why

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,839
um a platform as a service was created

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,120
um this while although this is

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,920
um a little out of date um

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,680
and these are the kind of most recent

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,040
figures i could kind of get my hand on

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,320
in terms of the

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,120
the benefits that these uh government

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,839
platform products have provided um so

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,480
you've got gov

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,600
uk in the middle that has provided you

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,040
know

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,240
tens of millions um and this is just in

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,160
one financial year so the benefit to

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,279
the taxpayer also government is kind of

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,640
palpable and visible so

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,760
um we're over on the right

00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,720
um around nine million pounds

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,760
worth of benefits that we've provided to

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,880
the public sector

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,640
by platform as a service and

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,399
cloud foundry essentially being in

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,920
existence so that's

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,880
that's great um but

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,320
uh i think we've we've also grown

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,800
heavily so i can speak

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,920
certainly around platinum service um to

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,320
say that in the last year

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,760
those 7.8 million pounds worth of

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,200
benefits have increased to around

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,959
12 so about 40 increase in the last

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,000
year on that um

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,360
yeah we're we continue to grow and

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,680
develop add features

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,120
and hopefully get more and more tenants

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,920
um and

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,040
uh underpinned um by cloud foundry and a

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,880
lot of that expertise

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,560
so that's great um

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,600
i will go into

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,720
uh sort of a bit of the

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,839
reason for us being and essentially what

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,600
cloud foundry

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:06,399
and us and folks like rafal

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:09,920
from the engineering side enables

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:13,360
other government departments so um

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,320
you know whenever a service is

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,680
designed and created and policy folks

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,000
around government are thinking about

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,519
what they need to do in order to allow

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,279
the citizen to interact

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,399
with government there are an underlying

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,920
set of problems that will eventually

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,959
or very quickly become

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,839
pretty present for anyone that wants to

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,600
run and service at scale so

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,320
finding web ops or site reliability

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,959
engineers

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:52,079
and infrastructure people is costly

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:55,360
they're not only to find

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,639
the kind of rights or talent but to keep

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,839
teams like that in employment

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:06,000
um procuring the appropriate hosting

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,000
and related tools that has to be

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,920
appropriate i suppose for government

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,800
type services

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,200
uh as you might as you might guess uk

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,959
gov

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,320
is very um up on

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,160
cyber security and making sure

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
the infrastructure is assured and

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,800
accredited and that kind of thing

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,839
so um the procurement process can

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,959
take an exorbitantly long time um

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,360
which is sort of contrary to

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,800
how folks obviously would like to do

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
rapid and agile development

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,279
then once potentially the

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,240
services kind of created but managing

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,399
that infrastructure and the deployments

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,440
and making sure everything was patched

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,880
and all of that

00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,160
these are you know the the life cycle of

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,120
a service or an application that is

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,720
being run is not just building it it's

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,200
running it it's maintaining it

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,160
it's all of the um extra stuff that

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,600
needs to be

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,040
um that needs to go with it

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,120
these challenges uh they're you know

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,320
pretty common uh to almost all the

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,639
services that

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,839
are existing in existence around around

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,000
golf

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,440
um service owners and people

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,760
sometimes have to think about this

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,200
sometimes they don't um

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,800
but the traditional way i suppose within

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,920
um certainly with the uk government is

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,880
that teams will then

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,519
procure components from different

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,000
vendors

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:51,199
or services aws these type of things um

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,079
and either

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,079
yeah have to

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,880
get someone to manage it for them or

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,240
employ a team that can manage it

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,720
themselves

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,000
which is why uh something like fans

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,680
coming along

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,120
um was is looking to solve

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,360
that issue um this

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,199
this was sort of the problem uh around

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,560
government before

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:21,600
profit uk pairs so across the top

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,000
across the top uh you've got the you've

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,199
got

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,680
an example of various different public

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,880
sector

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,680
bodies so when i say public sector i

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,760
mean

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,760
kind of any public service so that might

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,880
be a central government department

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,560
but it could also be potentially a local

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,760
government

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,760
body a council for instance there could

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,639
be a completely new department set up

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,079
such as when

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,639
we were exiting the eu that department

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,839
was set up

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,680
kind of overnight um and there are also

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,440
sort of arms length bodies things like

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,040
highways england and things like that

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,920
that manage some of the

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,320
transport and infrastructure around that

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,160
now

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,320
what you had in these cases was

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,240
every one of these departments also had

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,639
numerous

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,440
services that they needed to provide um

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,480
and also

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,199
various solutions so you might have

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,600
um one department doing everything on uh

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,639
one

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,680
one cloud-based hosting service

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
um a lot lots of places are still doing

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,360
things

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,800
on bare metal and on-prem kind of

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,800
infrastructure and then you'll also have

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,519
potentially legacy services and new

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,880
services

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,880
together and like people having to run

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,480
like a proliferation and always

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,079
increasing different types

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,079
of infrastructure and

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,759
yeah technology which becomes as you can

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,399
imagine very expensive

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,959
and in order to keep them running quite

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,240
often

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,759
folks would get locked into expensive

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,600
contracts and things like that with big

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,519
suppliers

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:12,160
so what the uk has

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,160
endeavoured to achieve and to

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,480
try and sort of approach was

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,399
you know being that platform as well as

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,399
a platform as a service

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,600
that would be a single kind of reliable

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,519
um uh cloud hosting solution

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,639
in public cloud um offer a marketplace

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,240
of backing services so different storage

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,560
types

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,000
and different types of services that

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,199
applies to applications

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,480
to allow their uh get their apps and

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,600
data working together quickly um

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,120
not only that because you know by

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,839
centralizing a lot of that sort of

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,680
investment

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,680
then able to build on that with new

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,639
features so as things like

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,800
within cloud foundry develop we can pass

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,800
on those benefits to our tenants

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,079
uh by enabling them through through our

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,120
platform um

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,240
and as mentioned before

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,280
always kept up to date and secured

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,720
um and respond to cvs within you know a

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,640
couple of days whenever

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:23,280
they come around and that makes

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:26,079
uh the um information assurance person

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,400
now around government very happy because

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,840
they

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,640
they know that that is

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,360
being taken into account what what this

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,640
means

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,240
for these services what this enables for

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,480
our teams across government that might

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,840
not have um the same

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,799
the resources or

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,480
capacity to be able to have these

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,760
multi-disciplinary teams

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,039
they have they have less need to hire

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,440
infrastructure engineers they spend less

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,440
time

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,039
they spend less time procuring and

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,280
setting up infrastructure and building

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,600
these services because there's already

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,600
an assured platform to build it on and

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,320
allows them to move kind of quickly and

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,799
freely so they can spend time

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,840
um iterating building their applications

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,080
making sure that their service

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,280
is meeting um

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,600
meeting the needs of their user um as

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,960
as far as possible without having to

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,640
worry about

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,799
i need to keep my operating system

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,480
patched and all that

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:32,480
all so ultimately

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,760
we are a shared platform that service

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,880
teams can use to

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,880
host our applications in the cloud we

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,480
manage the infrastructure

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,720
so that they can concentrate on building

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,559
high quality services and

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,440
over the sort of five years ago we've

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,480
seen some some great examples

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,480
of the transformation

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,600
of government and making it easier to

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,840
build and run

00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:01,440
cloud native services um

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,880
so uh this is probably more of a

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,400
sort of marketing type slide that when

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,520
we're

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,360
selling in the benefits of the uk has to

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,480
other different departments

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,960
we're kind of like uh you know

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,679
um look you just have to manage the

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,520
stuff at the top

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,280
if you just like build your application

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,039
and deal with the apis

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,280
we do all this good stuff that we do all

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,559
this good stuff down here at the bottom

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,080
and so

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,679
and we're clear about the kind of

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,440
division of responsibility

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,480
between that but by looking after all of

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,520
that kind of stuff

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,640
underneath it um and

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,559
enabling and offering things like the

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,840
cloud foundry cli and things like that

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,520
enables

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,200
service teams to really get started

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,880
quickly so it's quite a

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,679
compelling business software

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,120
sounds a lot like you folks are really

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,640
pampering and spoiling your engineers

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,679
sorry sorry for the interruption

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,080
uh well um i don't know if rafal

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,799
feels he's being pumped but maybe our

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,360
maybe our

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,039
uh our tenants are being pampered yes

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,480
yeah yeah yeah well we yeah

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,480
we um you know this and so this is

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,640
i'm i'm not going to speak too much

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,000
about this since uh you know

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,320
uh you folks are very familiar with

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,360
kind of like you are all at cloud

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,919
foundry so

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,480
this is all very familiar to you and how

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,000
um

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,280
cloud foundry using build packs and uh

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,559
what have you um enables

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,080
uh successful kind of

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:48,159
creation and running of applications

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:52,159
um i suppose our

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,880
stack as it were as as we know and

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,520
one of the reasons that uh um ram and

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,000
shadrach

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,679
uh reached out to ourselves we are built

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,240
on cloud boundary

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,400
um we use bosch to abstract our tenants

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,320
and extract our users away from the

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,520
underlying

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,080
infrastructure um and we deployed this

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,799
all

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,880
using concourse ci um

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,480
i don't know whether rafael you'd like

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,840
to kind of um

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,720
say anything about the maybe the

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,520
interplay between cloud foundry and

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,250
bosch or

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,240
like how maybe we

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,799
[Music]

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,919
interact with cloud foundry to work with

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:41,200
upstream and things like that

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,720
for majority of the thing we deploy cm

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,679
deployment

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,600
we have very few components that we

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,400
override ourselves for different needs

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,600
of our

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,720
users for example ua we kind of forked

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,240
it for the time being

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,000
and are providing like two or three

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,720
extra features

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
um other than that like it's pretty raw

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,159
cloud foundry that is

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,840
essentially managed with wash and

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,080
deployed with conquerors as mark said

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,360
yeah nice cool

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,480
um so i suppose from a higher level

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,919
kind of thing um by

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:23,120
using bosch to deploy things offering um

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,320
tenants the opportunity uh

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,600
of cf push which was pretty radical

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,919
i think um back when uh certainly when

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,960
we

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,200
kind of started um that you know

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,240
they could push an application and it is

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,360
running on the internet

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,720
in minutes it provides immense kind of

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,480
business fun

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,880
um and uh you know previously

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,760
there were certainly like instances and

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
things that i've

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,720
heard from our tenants that they would

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,720
have to kind of

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,960
go to it and operations uh provision

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,080
or procure and provision an environment

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
things like this and all of this can

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,520
take

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,320
absolutely weeks whereas um you know

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,600
with

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:11,840
cf push and um it's uh

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:15,679
a lot simpler um

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,600
so yeah uh as as you know

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,080
this is bosch that's what we use it kind

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,559
of sort of use it for

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,760
um this this layer and bosch is

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,799
completely invisible

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,559
uh to the to the tent we don't expose um

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:33,840
bosch at all uh to to our

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:37,600
tenants um i believe that's correct

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,799
um but then with uh cf push

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,679
and uh command line interface um we do

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,880
expose that

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,919
and so we have tenants uh that are

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:53,440
interacting directly with the cli

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:56,480
um and yeah we we we just use the cscli

00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,640
so we expose all of those commands and

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,600
uh we generally just take a a

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,120
fork or a fork pretty much um cloud

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
financial documentation and things like

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,760
that

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,320
and once um users and

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,279
tenants are kind of used to it the the

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,720
feedback is

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,919
usually um resoundingly kind of positive

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,840
uh there is that i like i feel and

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,679
and from speaking to our tenants uh

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,120
cloud foundry is definitely fulfilling a

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,000
real

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,360
niche in the market in terms of a

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,840
compelling

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,880
um and very user-friendly developer

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,679
experience

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,480
uh the we haven't necessarily we haven't

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,559
really come across

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,600
in other technologies and things like

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,679
that was

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,120
um the main reason so if we went for a

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,679
cloud foundry

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:51,360
in the first place

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:54,640
this might be a bit overkill

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,919
uh this is sort of our architecture

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,200
of the environment and how um it's kind

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,480
of

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,360
set up so end users access

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,000
services using web browser as you expect

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,159
developers access the service either

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
via a web browser we have a admin

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,440
console

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,480
passmin as we as we call it

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,159
or by accessing the api um using

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,600
customer encode or using the cli

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,679
inbound traffic flows through load

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,480
balancers

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,559
they have aws shield advance enabled to

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,520
protect the platform

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,960
um requests are passed to the router

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,240
determining

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,559
whether forward where to pull the

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,159
traffic to and which of the cells is

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,679
responsible for running

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:51,039
that tenant's application the

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,039
router to applications running on

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:58,000
running on cells these are ec2

00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,559
resources um applications on

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
the cells may may contact private

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,960
applications on other cells

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,320
for um backing services off the internet

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,240
as it were

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,840
um api requests passed

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,840
through the load balancer to cloud

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,720
controller

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,520
um and cloud controller is responsible

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,640
for managing

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,640
all the api requests for platform

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,039
actions

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,039
wondering kind of do you

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,760
want to explain the um a bit more around

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,559
the

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,960
cloud foundry control plane referral or

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,960
the or

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,600
um as you said this is probably an

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,400
overkill but uh yeah essentially we

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,039
we deploy a few brokers on top of cloud

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,039
foundry

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,799
and some others with bosch itself um

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,559
and those are essentially you know

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,320
standard brokers just interacting with

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,720
external services like one of them

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,360
is avon just to provide few uh

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,919
few marketplace options for our tenants

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,130
some of them are more direct like rds or

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,279
s3sqs brokers um

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,200
[Music]

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,480
that will just directly interact with

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:21,120
our aws accounts

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:23,440
just to create those um

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,120
yeah i don't think there's much to it

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,799
like it's it's pretty much standard um

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,480
architecture from cloud foundry to be

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,600
honest there's not much magic

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,360
we introduce yeah

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,399
so uh diego for scheduling workloads

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,440
um aggregator for access logs

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,399
um debugging and we use um

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,760
uh autoscaler the autoscaler as well

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,120
pretty much straight up straight out of

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,880
the box

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:56,000
so yeah um the sort of

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,640
uh size of it um i suppose or how we

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,159
kind of

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,120
set it up um we started

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,399
our first kind of foundation as it were

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,520
was in dublin

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,799
so um eu west one

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,039
i'm not sure if that's one or two i

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:14,240
think it's one um on aws

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,760
but we have three availability zones

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,120
um we then uh so that you know

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,240
if there was any issues that we could

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,679
fail over gracefully

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,399
into other availability zones

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,080
um and then due to this small thing

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,360
called brexit

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,559
and data of sovereignty uh some of our

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,399
tenants were like

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,080
oh it's got to be hosted in london it's

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,039
got to be hosted in london

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,600
and so we basically duplicated our

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,039
foundry

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,640
and now we have two um dublin and london

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:51,840
which potentially allows us

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,960
um you know a lot of resilience if

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,520
people are savvy enough to like run one

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,720
thing so

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,760
both regions um but

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,480
generally speaking uh all of any new

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,440
tenants

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,480
um and a lot of existing tenants have

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,480
all migrated

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,840
um onto the london region and that is

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,840
our primary

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:18,559
foundry um

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:21,440
i can't remember sort of the size

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,960
or sort of the number kind of sounds

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,000
only that london

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,720
is a good sort of 60 bigger i think than

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,919
dublin

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,320
um yeah

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,360
we just increased numbers of cells in

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,559
london to 102 today

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,840
so that's a lot of machines yeah that's

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,840
a lot of machines

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,039
thanks thanks yeah um it's been a lot of

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,159
years in the

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:57,520
lincoln right um and

00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,320
uh yeah so we try i suppose now

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,320
um using the resources we have to

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,320
support our tenants and users

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,799
um from the whole sort of user journey

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,080
or life cycle i suppose it's more more

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,559
appropriate

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,720
um from sort of becoming aware that a

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,200
team needs to

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,159
find somewhere to host that verification

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,840
um

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,360
through to supporting them in terms of

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,159
evaluating its use

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,159
so some of our documentation how we meet

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,679
security principles how we

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,600
we meet ia and service level agreements

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,080
we also potentially help them with

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,960
onboarding in terms of documentation

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,960
make the uh make all of the sort of

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,399
common commands and

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:45,600
um uh the cfcli very

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:50,000
kind of easy to interpret and

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,640
um we as mentioned we have this uh

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,520
i'll show you in a minute the tasman

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,799
interface

00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,159
uh online where you can sign up for

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:03,519
a class account and

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,640
that connects directly to uaa

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,240
um to in order to create sort of user

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,840
accounts as part of

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,600
that cloud foundry um and

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,720
then enabling the sort of running and

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,760
maintaining um enabling people to scale

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,320
and if necessary once a service is no

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,440
longer

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,559
required we offer that facility as well

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,600
so we're a sort of full um full life

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,440
cycle

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,240
service and you know these are the sort

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,600
of

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,080
um touch points as phones

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,880
that uh tenants and expected tenants

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,240
will come

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,840
come to so um we have a lot we have

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,120
a full kind of web interface which is a

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,679
cloud

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,440
uk if anyone would like to have a look

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,519
um there you can view our sort of

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,640
pricing and the backing services

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,720
as well as sign up for it manage your

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,080
team permissions

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,000
and uh that kind of thing there's also a

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,200
technical documentation

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,240
uh bottom left is uh representing

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,240
the um cli that developers um

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,519
will interact with um and we also

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,960
offer some um things like backing

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:27,760
service metrics um in the admin console

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:31,120
so the uh i mean these they're not

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:34,240
i suppose the fidelity that um i'm sure

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,440
engineers on the call uh would

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,399
expect but uh they allow a kind of

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,320
nice overview of things to see when

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,840
people might be approaching

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:50,399
um capacity of

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,919
databases or um increased 500

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:57,279
errors and things like that so

00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:00,799
that's useful for them and

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,799
for the other side of uh business

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,640
uh how much does it cost and we'll have

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,880
a have a billion skills

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,480
so it's a it's a pretty kind of rounded

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,919
product product

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,960
um so i kind of

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,679
i suppose main motivations

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,679
and what we enable teams to do

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:29,120
most commonly um i suppose is either

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:32,320
a team that needs to launch a

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,840
service quickly they

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,960
have either either as i say like a

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,039
department's been stood up overnight and

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,159
they need to get something out quickly

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,600
um or

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,480
sort of a more considered approach is

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,960
when

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,919
we have solution architects technical

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,360
architects

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,559
wanting to consolidate onto um

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,760
sort of more consistent uh a more

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,080
consistent platform

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,080
so that there are no sort of surprises

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,240
and they're not having to

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:10,159
run myriad different infrastructures

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,720
um because of the type of

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,440
i think because of the type of service

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,480
and

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,720
digital experience that government

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,040
tends to offer we're probably a

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,240
very good fit for probably in excess of

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,359
eighty percent of

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,839
digital services they could all probably

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,280
uh if if they were so inclined should i

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,440
say because they're not mandated

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,720
to use this they were so inclined they

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,440
could

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,040
um create three-tier typical services

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,800
backed with a database that would live

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,320
very happily on paths um there are

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,359
uh also things obviously uh technologies

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,079
change

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,480
friends change um that don't necessarily

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,679
fit

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,320
um perfectly on paths um but

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,040
for the vast majority of stuff in

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,560
government

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,839
we're solid these are just

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,800
some of the kind of user

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,200
needs or challenges that we look to

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,200
address

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:17,599
and look to address them through our

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,280
documentation i suppose or

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,200
through feature development and user

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,000
research in order to

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,880
deliver a service um to them that they

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,880
can meet their needs

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:35,040
but ultimately um

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,920
so we try to create we've tried to

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,520
create a platform

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,560
that makes it easier to securely

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,599
and rely reliably run

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:49,040
services with

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,000
fewer operations and site reliability

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,000
engineers as possible

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,079
and so they don't have to get involved

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,000
in the infrastructure

00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,599
we want to make a developer friendly

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,040
experience so they can move

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,920
quickly iterate on their designs and

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,960
get something out um something that

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,240
adheres to

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,079
the government service standard

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,760
which is sort of the governance process

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,359
that all services and government have to

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,800
go through in order to

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:23,200
um continue to get funding and go

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:26,800
live um and we look to do this obviously

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,560
in the most cost effective way uh to be

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,240
the best benefit for the taxpayer and

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,560
also by providing a platform

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,960
stops the proliferation of every

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,240
government department creating their own

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,839
cloud platform that's in essence

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,839
the the

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,119
um as such we now

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,440
have lots and lots

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,320
of tenants from sort of all across the

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,680
public sector

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,480
so um international trade cabinet office

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,240
home office

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,960
um various folks and various services

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,320
from these um but also

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,800
um not necessarily the

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,760
central government so civil aviation

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,359
authority

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,040
is a public

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,720
funded corporation i i don't actually

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,680
know in terms of the

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,520
uh the government that uh technically

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,920
looks at the uk civil aviation authority

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,240
but

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,119
they uh you know are the governance of

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,160
our skies

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:36,079
um and make sure that uh you know

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,200
um aviation operators are um doing

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,320
things appropriately

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,680
um the uh yeah the actual

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,960
the the caa service that is on is on

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,400
um has is um for

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,520
registering and educating yourself about

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,880
uh drones and model aircraft

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,880
so wow okay yeah

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,160
yeah it's pretty interesting like to see

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,560
all the um cf like presently serving all

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,560
this

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,680
you know important sector of the uk

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,119
government it's really really

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,200
interesting and

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,359
yeah we're basically making an impact

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,280
and i love that

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,800
yeah uh it's a it's a big impact you

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,040
know and um

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,839
i'll i'll get on to some of the kind of

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,960
the the

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,400
biggest ones so um uh yeah

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,640
over in the right we've got flying and

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,680
drones model aircraft

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,800
we've got up

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,040
kind of front and center and top middle

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,280
uh so gov uk notify our notifications

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,359
platform actually lives on pass

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,720
so we're eating our own dog food so to

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,480
speak um

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:46,079
where uh water hosts host that

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,520
um and the top the top right one was

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,160
uh top left one sorry um getting support

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,320
if you're

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,320
clinically extremely vulnerable to any

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,119
virus this was a

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,079
service that was stood up within four

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,240
days

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,119
at the beginning of of the at the

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,480
beginning of the pandemic

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,920
and between between it going between

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,839
the sort of first full request and

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,160
um the first care package getting

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,280
delivered

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,359
uh to uh shielding people was only

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,280
uh i think like seven dates in total

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,920
just the service itself was like

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,000
four days it's so and that's only that's

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,280
been made possible only because of

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
um pads and cloud foundry

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,280
um providing that and being able to move

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,839
that swiftly and

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,960
reliably if it wasn't if it wasn't kind

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,079
of

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,119
um if it wasn't quick and safe um then

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,560
people wouldn't use it

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,800
but because it's been assured and

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,680
uh accredited by cabinet office people

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,119
know that it

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,320
is and is run by us

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,480
um yeah so this is and

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,680
it's not just it's not just paz i hate

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,880
the patients who add

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,000
notify um uh

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,560
there there is a article about this on

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,680
that on

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,520
that blog that can be searched but

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:15,119
we're we're talk so notify um

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,359
uh shortly after the pandemic started um

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,400
uh the nhs who were already using notify

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,319
but um

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,920
they decided to use notify for all of

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,760
the notifications

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,240
around test and trace um and

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,280
uh getting coverage tests and things

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,480
like that

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,240
and they've they're now they

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,319
they went from something like their

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,160
busiest ever day being two million

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:43,119
to scaling up to like 25 million a day

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,839
like with it within within like a week

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,240
and

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,440
that's you know and ultimately that's

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,560
underpinned by

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:55,200
um uh technology

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:58,320
cloud foundry all being um to make this

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,520
to enable this so it's great um

00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,079
[Music]

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,280
we've been growing consistently i think

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,000
kind of

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,480
probably clear-ish to see that sort of

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,760
there is a

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:15,760
an increase in that gradient um uh

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:18,880
from around the start of march last year

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,160
and that's that's definitely as a result

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,839
of being able to

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,880
uh yeah so so here we are on this is the

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,160
pink bar is the beginning of march 2020

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,680
and there's been sort of a marked uh

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,040
increasing growth rate of folks using

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,079
platform as a service

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,440
as a as a result of either needing to

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,800
stand up um services quickly as a result

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,000
of the pandemic either because they're

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,560
new services

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,079
or migrating things online because

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,200
people are no longer in offices

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:57,520
and able to um offer these

00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,880
things in uh in person

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,520
um what i

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,079
quickly sort of go over this because i

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,280
suppose

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,760
from a sales point of view

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,440
um and what government services sort of

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,280
care about

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,119
this is yeah i'm pretty much interested

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,359
in this yeah

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,359
this is how uh we sort of sell our

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,119
benefits case and how we break down

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,839
so um yes you have avoided build costs

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,040
because

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,240
uh um either uh services will have to

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,400
build and procure

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,920
their own platforms or their own

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,079
infrastructure

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,960
procurement from the open market or the

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,040
gcloud and digital marketplace can take

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,680
up to six months

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,960
plus whatever build time there is that

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,240
infrastructure and in

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,040
that in-house solution um

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,040
has has done that you can you can just

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,079
take pads off the shelf and

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,520
you don't have to worry about the

00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,760
daily maintenance costs is truly

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,920
kind of where we see and deliver most

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,960
benefits government

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,720
because from individual

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,720
government departments needing to employ

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,160
engineers that are appropriate and

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,800
confident in kind of doing this

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,119
it's expensive and keeping them securely

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,160
patched up-to-date running efficiently

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,000
support you name it that's very

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,200
expensive

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,800
and so uh being able to lessen that

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,400
burden by offering powers

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:36,240
is it's great because of our scale

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,040
we can offer potentially cheaper

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,800
uh cloud resource costs we do a lot of

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,359
reserved instances and things like that

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,119
so they can benefit from that

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:50,240
and yeah avoided need for procurement

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,040
and information assurance that

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,920
is probably something pretty unique to

00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:00,240
government services

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,800
in terms of you know i don't know how

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,280
how many other folks that are using

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,040
cloud foundry

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,400
have to think about this as much but

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,079
making sure everything is

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,720
um able and able to

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,520
host personal data up to official

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,240
sensitive

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,440
in government parliaments is very

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,359
important to

00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:26,560
our stakeholders um some of the sort of

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,359
softer benefits i suppose that

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,480
one gets from using pads in cloud

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,280
foundry

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,480
because we have that expertise and the

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,520
team that runs it

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,800
and the cloud foundry community um an

00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,599
open source project

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,119
behind it then you have that sort of

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,760
trickle down of

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,760
increased

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:53,359
maturity of offer enabling

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,680
new features um and uh

00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,480
and you folks spending so much time on

00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,599
enabling

00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,680
that um uh great

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,280
uh developer experience and things like

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,680
that so uh

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,920
some of those yeah so while we might not

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,040
be able to measure it directly

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,280
um uh i think it's obvious

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,280
hopefully for everyone to see how much

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,000
sort of value cloud foundry has

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,040
has brought by offering the open source

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,040
project in the community

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,440
um we have a public roadmap

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,160
which is sort of how we decide what to

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,280
or one of the

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,079
ways we decide which how to prioritize

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,119
things

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,680
um it's on github if anyone wants to

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,200
kind of look

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,200
this is old but um

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,079
and yeah this is sort of hopefully the

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,839
sort of

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:51,920
as we are underpinning part of gaap um

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:55,200
then government services can host on us

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:59,280
design it on brand take payments

00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:02,880
offer notifications in reliable

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,920
successful and secure secure way

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,960
so uh yeah it's hope

00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,240
i think that's been

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,920
sort of evident to see um

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,960
quickly because um

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,960
i appreciate that potentially

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,319
coming to time maybe not i don't know

00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,880
how much time do i have ram

00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,800
cataract am i am i okay do you want me

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,119
to shut up

00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,119
oh no you're doing fine go on no problem

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,880
um so uh at the beginning of the year we

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,280
were

00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,040
um actually a few few less than this and

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,240
a few different faces

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:45,839
um but sort of this has been

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:49,200
the the makeup we were about at max

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:53,440
15. we have grown very quickly

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:56,720
very quickly actually in the last um

00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:00,560
few months um i did sort of a stock take

00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:03,280
uh it's all for stock register um

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,480
and we're about we're we're approaching

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,599
now

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:11,359
24 people we've got some people joining

00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:13,440
um but uh up up until sort of the

00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,240
beginning of the beginning of the year

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,960
um rafael might be able to correct me

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,880
but i think

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:24,000
we were two developers

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,680
four or five sres

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,599
um including a tech lead and

00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:34,640
one primarily front end developer

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,880
um and hopefully

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,000
hopefully in a not too far distant

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,000
future we've got

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,920
um we'll kind of expand that probably to

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,359
eight sres um three or four developers

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,240
and under tech so

00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:53,599
which you know for us will be a massive

00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,040
massive increase in our

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,559
engineering capacity and things like

00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:01,680
that and that'll be great

00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:05,119
bearing in mind um we've

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,880
already been sort of um

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,200
yeah as i say hosting services from

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,000
around 200 organizations

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,119
uh including things like including

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,119
things like notify

00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:20,160
that um are sending billions of messages

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,800
a year um there's some there's some

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,000
really sort of

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,599
critical critical stuff on there and the

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,920
friendship we've been doing that with

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,960
like

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,440
around 10 people yeah um

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,520
it's it's not it's not necessarily been

00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,960
easy it's been quite hairy at times

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:41,040
but it's been it's been very rewarding

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,040
um and hopefully

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,319
you know i'm sure as engineers yourself

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:53,200
you understand or can understand the um

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,839
struggle sometimes to make it visible

00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,960
what it is

00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,839
that uh and how integrals the

00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,359
infrastructure

00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,359
thinks and what cloud foundry

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,520
not is not something that's easily

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,720
visible and you can point to and say

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,280
this is what we do but you know without

00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,000
it

00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,559
uh you know the internet kills over and

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,040
uh

00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,599
you know i have very angry people on the

00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,720
phone

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:22,160
being like why can't we do it

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,559
any trade internationally anymore so

00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,079
uh and you know that's that a lot of

00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,040
that's underpinned with cloud foundry

00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,640
and things like that

00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:34,400
so it's it's been a good

00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,960
good partnership in that regards um

00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,760
needs evolve same with the products so

00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,200
just sort of

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:44,720
to say kind of what um the future

00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:48,400
i think holds for us um we are keeping

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,480
a keen eye on cloud foundry

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,760
um understanding kind of what the future

00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,319
of bosch is and

00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,040
what future with kubernetes and things

00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:57,839
might

00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,640
entail so we're keeping open-minded

00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,359
around that as

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,280
as mentioned we have a well a a whole

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:06,480
ecosystem would be a whole

00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,920
um you know user base that will

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,520
need to move with us i suppose

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:17,040
um so uh we are

00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,520
um you know currently embarking on what

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,800
we think

00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:24,160
sort of should be the next steps how we

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,920
um mature with the evolving needs of our

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,520
of our community of our community our

00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,160
tenant base but also

00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,040
the uh evolving needs of posting

00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,079
generally

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,640
um what are the trends that um

00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,359
shadrach was mentioning that uh we need

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,240
to

00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:42,079
be mindful of death and keep up to date

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,640
because you know otherwise we become the

00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,319
legacy

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,319
technology and then um

00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:54,000
see see what happens from that regard

00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:57,280
but yeah so i suppose i mean governments

00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,040
historically and generally don't move

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,079
too quickly so i'm not saying i'm not

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,880
saying that the

00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,800
success the successor or what we decide

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,839
to do will be in the next

00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:14,400
three four even six months but

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:16,559
um we'll keep uh abreast of

00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,760
the cloud foundry foundation and the

00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,040
community and

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,680
hopefully um share some learnings and

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,119
understand from from where you're going

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,319
where we want to go

00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:32,000
and uh hopefully

00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:35,119
carve a path um together so that uh

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,520
we can offer um a platform that's

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:40,559
different purpose for many years to come

00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,960
um so yeah i think

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,720
i think that's really sort of more like

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,000
well it's all i've prepared

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:51,520
for sure and all i wanted to say um

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,839
but uh hopefully that yeah let's

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,839
gives you sort of a bit of a uh

00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,359
overview and understanding into what

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,839
rafale and i

00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:07,359
do uh every day

00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:11,520
um and um yeah i'd be happy

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:14,160
if there are um questions or

00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,880
you know what what now what what what

00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,880
would you folks like

00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,599
um so we usually like check if there are

00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,800
questions but

00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,200
um i'm looking at other channels and it

00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,760
seems

00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,040
like there's no question which is

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,200
totally fine

00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,280
i mean it seems like that means your

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,440
presentation was really really good and

00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,640
clear that nobody had any single

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,559
question because

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,760
i mean because or the answer to that

00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,079
question in the uh

00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,440
presentation so that's why we make one

00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,599
way we can think about it

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,880
which is a good thing yeah i'll take it

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,240
i'll take it i'll take it that way

00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,480
shadrach brothers

00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:55,359
oh my god i'm so bored stop talking

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,559
questions it's just that good that

00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,960
people don't need to ask questions

00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,880
because

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,280
your presentation is just really really

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,119
good yeah so let's take it like that

00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,920
um personally i actually enjoyed it

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,839
because um it just shows how much

00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,119
impacts cloud foundry is making in the

00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,280
world like for

00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,240
somewhere as big as the uk you know you

00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,160
know serving

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,920
like the government data services like

00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:19,040
that much you know just seeing

00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,480
um this particular um technology in

00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,440
action just makes me really really proud

00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,119
of the fact that

00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,040
you know i work with the foundation and

00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,880
i'm trying my best you know put the

00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,160
um the gospel let's see the gospel of

00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,640
cloud crowdfunding out there make more

00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,880
people

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,000
adopt it like you know like the uk

00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,040
government and

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,640
you know the uk um of the uk pass

00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,559
so it's like a really really big deal

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,160
and i appreciate you for like

00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,839
you know breaking it down telling us

00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,559
everything we're single we really need

00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,160
to know

00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,680
i mean listen now the departments that

00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,000
sort of benefits from the

00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,240
uk powers also was like really really

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,079
interesting and very very good to see

00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,359
so i appreciate that that presentation

00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,079
was really really

00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,480
um really really good like i definitely

00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,000
would

00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,920
look at it some other time and watch

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,119
this video over again so no

00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,880
okay so i'm working for um i'm working

00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,720
i'm advocating for a technology that is

00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,200
being used by the uk

00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,400
you know you know how big that is and

00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,400
you know how um

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,160
it's working effortlessly and you know

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,839
there's no downtime there's no stuff

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,079
there's no like stress for developers

00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,720
that

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,640
are coming on board so um that's like

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,559
something to be proud of so thank you um

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,280
for doing that mark i really appreciate

00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,680
that

00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,280
um um ram do you like have anything to

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,960
say i mean just so we don't spend too

00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,839
much time you know trying to

00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,440
talk much yeah i think that was a

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:37,119
wonderful summary of

00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:40,160
um what the

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:42,000
government as a platform means i i

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,079
really love that term i'm going to

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,920
tweet about it like five times this week

00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:49,359
but

00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:52,000
it's it's very heartening to see what um

00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:54,160
cloud foundry the technology and the

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,319
cloud foundry community at large

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,359
to be honest has uh has been able to

00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,440
deliver now

00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:01,359
obviously you know it was not built in a

00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,000
day um it's taken

00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:05,599
years of efforts um from so many

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,480
different people and

00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,680
it's just again it's just so warm and so

00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,680
heartening to

00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,680
just watch the story play out and

00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,000
make something you know come alive at uh

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,359
government scale now

00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,720
i just wanted to dig a little bit deeper

00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:28,160
in the little time that we have about um

00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:31,599
what does a footprint look like

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,000
for a particular department like

00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,640
what's what's it like with one of your

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,920
tenants

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,720
um do they have like a few websites few

00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,440
apps

00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,520
can you put a number to it what's their

00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,839
team size like

00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:50,640
um so it it varies uh

00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:51,760
immensely so some of our biggest some of

00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,119
our biggest tenants

00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:58,240
um are essentially uh you know

00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:01,520
um they have hundreds of applications

00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,720
um and many many services i mean so

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:08,240
the the two the two foundries uh dublin

00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,640
ireland um dublin and london together

00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,160
there's around two and a half thousand

00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,160
running applications

00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,599
obviously in that communication it's not

00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,520
it's not a service but it gives you sort

00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,960
of a

00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,040
escape the scale that we're talking

00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,240
about um

00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:27,520
and you know but people vary from

00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,160
thing like a some smaller departments

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,240
might

00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,839
just be running a couple of prototypes

00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,119
and you know

00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:38,160
okay a tiny amount of compute up

00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,680
to um uh some departments are

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,319
essentially going

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,280
up uk paths first and trying to put all

00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,000
of their

00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,640
uh of their digital estate off um and

00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,440
doing

00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:51,359
things like um their single sign-on and

00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,720
their some of their crm systems

00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:58,160
uh so like lots of this

00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:00,160
all on all on um on paths and

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,559
they're you know spending tens of

00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,839
thousands um

00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:09,280
a month so um but what

00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:12,319
i think what we have the the sort of the

00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,520
the services or the at that end of the

00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:16,799
scale as in

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:20,160
they're all in on paths um they

00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:23,839
generally also have pretty sort of uh

00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:26,240
mature um sre capabilities

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:27,680
um themselves and their own operations

00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,520
capabilities

00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,040
um although uh by using paths it

00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,079
supplements that massively

00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:39,359
so instead of having 12 engineers

00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,799
they can have two kind of things to look

00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,960
after the infrastructure

00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:44,319
but at the other end um you know you've

00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,440
got uh

00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:48,799
uh folks that we're enabling them to

00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,640
deliver applications

00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,559
and run them without having any

00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,920
operations kind of capability at all

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:59,280
or at least no dedicated capability

00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,400
so and we've yeah and

00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,000
from various sort of uh stakeholder

00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,960
interviews and things like that we know

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,480
that we've

00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,079
not only saved them like thousands of

00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,440
pounds but also

00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,079
um weeks and weeks of either training or

00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,400
development

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:19,920
expertise and enabling enabling them

00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,160
to maintain

00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,000
um and run services in a sustainable

00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:27,119
fashion rather than

00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,160
um uh getting a say

00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,920
an agency or a supplier to build it

00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,760
and then being stuck with them forever

00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,839
because they can't run itself

00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,280
but having something like cars and that

00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:41,280
enables them to

00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:44,319
um do that at a fraction of the cost so

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:47,440
um there are lots of benefits or

00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:48,160
likes we had at every sort of part of

00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,680
the stack

00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:54,880
as it were

00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,280
nice yeah i mean i definitely think i

00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,000
can

00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,799
go on and on but in the interest of time

00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,319
i think it's a

00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:06,319
it's a good point to conclude but

00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,760
mark your you you and the team are

00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,359
building like

00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,760
infrastructure of the present and

00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:13,760
envisioning infrastructure of the future

00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,520
on behalf of like so many different

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,079
government agencies and things like that

00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,400
and

00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,440
on behalf of the larger cloud foundry

00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,920
community

00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,760
um and one of the things that you did

00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,720
note in your presentation is

00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,799
you know evolving into the future and as

00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,200
a community and as part of the

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,160
cloud foundry foundation i think we are

00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,200
also on a

00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:38,000
very interesting path uh in terms of

00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,280
incorporating the latest sort of

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,160
elements from

00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,240
um cloud native infrastructure into the

00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,000
cloud foundry experience and

00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,760
we are also evolving the platform so

00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,440
specifically um

00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,520
there's there's a lot of effort that's

00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,599
going into making cloud foundry

00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,079
available for kubernetes infrastructure

00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,400
and

00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,079
we're watching like the first successful

00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,079
rollouts in like

00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,440
um government scale operations and

01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,839
things like that and

01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,040
we're definitely going to bring that to

01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:07,040
your doorstep

01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,160
and um i think the journey should

01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:12,400
continue it should evolve and it should

01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,440
become bigger and you know just help

01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,640
serve like

01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,200
a lot more um folks at large

01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,680
so thank you so much for being here

01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,559
modern whole building just there so if

01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,079
you can base to

01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,680
if you can bring the future to my

01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,200
doorstep ram you know

01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,799
we're just around the corner from that

01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:50,079
so actually

01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:52,799
i that's that's some very

01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:56,480
needed motivation so thank you i'll

01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,960
experience

01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:10,079
and the cloud foundry um story

01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,760
that's that's okay

01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,280

you know we enjoy being part of the

01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,400
community um

01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,680
that's the joy of sort of open source

01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,119
and things like that

01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:25,200
um but uh also you know i am

01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,880
well i'm the only one with a face on on

01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,640
this stream but you know

01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:33,200
thank thanks yeah thank you for

01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,760
um for joining for sure as one of the

01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,880
longest

01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:40,000
standing members of uh uk but also

01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,400
the whole the whole expanding team um

01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,400
on government uk has and that's that's

01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,799
not just engineers we've got

01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,040
lots of uh uses of center design and

01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:51,520
products and delivery management so

01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,319
yeah it takes a it takes a lot of work

01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,799
but

01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:58,480
as you you've hopefully just understood

01:01:54,799 --> 01:02:01,359
some of the benefits of it so it's great

01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,119
yeah that's dope yeah um yeah so yeah

01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:04,160
thank you for this like i really enjoyed

01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,960
it i mean

01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,359
it was really an eye opener to see how

01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,359
many

01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,480
like how many important you know

01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:13,039
communities that the

01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,839
um cal foundry technology store it like

01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,520
is

01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:17,599
is serving so it was really an eye

01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,079
opener so thank you for doing this and

01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,839
um

01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,079
i don't know if nobody butchery i cannot

01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,960
talk today um that would probably be in

01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,920
the next

01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,599
live stream um i usually talk a lot like

01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,000
at this live stream once today i was

01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,720
like required because i wanted to like

01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,160
learn

01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,000
from like what you've seen what you've

01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,520
been saying so um

01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,200
maybe next time you still love my

01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,079
trolling of rama you know

01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,640
banter etc but today it was just like

01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:45,039
more about

01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,480
lenin okay well you know

01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,240
next time we'll have some more back and

01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,559
forth shadrach you know

01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,079
then it's like less just me talking but

01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,440
um yeah no thank you

01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,599
yeah thanks for the opportunity it's

01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,240
good yeah sure didn't show me yeah

01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,200
anytime

01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,839
anytime shortened yeah so i think um

01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,760
with that

01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:05,200
if there are no questions i just checked

01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:08,400
the youtube stream and um

01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:10,160
okay so how often i just saw a question

01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,599
i don't know if it's actually

01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:16,559
yeah so someone said how often

01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:19,200
do you upgrade or patch if i'm not

01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:22,400
mistaken

01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,079
um well uh we have

01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,319
so some of the cadence of our kind of

01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,599
meetings we have sort of a monthly

01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:30,400
meeting where we look at

01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,760
all of the upgrades that have happened

01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,640
to the various components

01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,000
that month um so i think not only like

01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,160
cloud foundry so obviously

01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,760
the build packs and things like that and

01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:42,240
cloud foundry itself

01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,400
um but also the backing services that we

01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:47,599
um enable to make sure um

01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:51,039
to upgrade and catch them but also

01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:53,520
we respond to cds and things

01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,559
like that that come that come in sort of

01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,680
as soon as possible

01:03:54,559 --> 01:04:00,000
we have targets to kind of um

01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,960
deal with any cvs within sort of five

01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,359
days

01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,119
uh but yeah generally we're trying to

01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:07,520
get onto sort of

01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,240
a monthly cadence at least for some of

01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:12,480
these things

01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:14,240
um just so that we don't start sort of

01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,240
wading through our own tech debt

01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:20,960
and things like that and and get behind

01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,000
so yeah usually we at least meet about

01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,280
it monthly

01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,880
cves as soon as

01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,839
yeah that makes sense that makes sense i

01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:32,960
think that about answers the question

01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:35,200
um since there are no more questions

01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,880
let's not go ahead of time and you know

01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,799
