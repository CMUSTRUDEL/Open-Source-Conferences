Title: How Volkswagen and Rakuten Use Cloud Foundry For Multi-Cloud
Publication date: 2016-09-22
Playlist: Case Studies
Description: 
	Most organizations today are managing multiple clouds, but it can be difficult. Volkswagen, Rakuten, and PaaS providers explain how the Cloud Foundry platform can be used strategically for multi-cloud - allowing organizations to choose the right cloud for the right workload, create redundancy, avoid vendor lock-in, and focus on applications instead of infrastructure. https://www.cloudfoundry.org/

multi-cloud is something every

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,040
organization is considering be it from

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,860
startup to enterprise fortune 500 global

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,630
2000 they're evaluating their entire

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,670
application and technology portfolios

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,990
and trying to best figure out where

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,000
their application workloads should

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,150
reside and how they should manage those

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,090
workloads as commonly factura all the

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,990
accounts have sent us today and we

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:35,670
produce each year 10 million of cars and

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:38,640
from 2018 this will all be connected to

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:44,640
our data centers and also connected to

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:47,460
each other called foundry is in my

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,940
opinion an excellent platform to target

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,980
multi-cloud because it has this very

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,680
neat and very clean separation of

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,609
concern between the platter itself and

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,829
the adapter that it's used to actually

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,409
perform the deploys on different clouds

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,200
now we're living in a technology field

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,570
business Renaissance no application is

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,670
an island no business process is an

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,290
island everything is connected there

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,220
will be multiple clouds in many

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,920
different clouds there's not one

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,909
internet there's not one cloud

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,610
abstracting away the infrastructure

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,400
abstracting away the cloud allows us

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,930
then to choose a different cloud based

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,479
on characteristics that we might not

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,979
even know today so two years from now we

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,360
might choose a different cloud it's

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,860
really important that we still have the

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,270
application running but the

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,799
infrastructure doesn't matter

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,750
and I think Cloud Foundry has a really

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,970
strong role in that that whole use case

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,070
because now if the infrastructure is not

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,689
critical to have to try to tinker with

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,820
you can now focus on the applications

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,290
and look at our foundry as that platform

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,240
for you to focus on your application

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:53,729
services for the developers it's almost

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,509
the same the same platform the same

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,430
methodology the same environment and

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,189
that's great because the forms the

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,950
development teams shouldn't be any

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,920
difference between deploying an

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,899
application on-premise or deploying the

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,270
application run on a public cloud

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,290
doesn't matter which publicly multi

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,769
cloud is actually

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,629
just realities of today's enterprise you

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,430
want to be able to choose to public

00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,590
cloud providers and also have on-prem

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,599
possibly and we're going to just

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,819
continue to see a mixed use of

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,439
underlying infrastructure and choices

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,450
about where we host our applications and

00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,189
where we store data one of the things we

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,170
love about Cloud Foundry is it really is

00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:36,299
enterprise friendly in the sense that it

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,579
doesn't require you to go start over

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,439
from scratch and so an enterprise

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:43,739
doesn't have to whip and replace all of

00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,900
their data and change how they do data

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,389
management in order to gain advantage

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,519
from Cloud Foundry which is which is

00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:53,540
essential because applications come and

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,540
