	Microservices, Events, and Breaking the Data Monolith with Kafka - Ben Stopford, Confluent & Cornelia Davis, Pivotal 

One of the trickiest problems with microservices is dealing with data as it becomes spread across many different bounded contexts.

Event-first thinking has a plethora of other advantages too, pulling in concepts from event sourcing, stream processing, and domain-driven design. 
  In this talk, you will learn the following: Transform the data monolith to microservices. Manage bounded contexts for data fields that overlap  Use event architectures that apply streaming technologies like Kafka to address the challenges of distributed data
