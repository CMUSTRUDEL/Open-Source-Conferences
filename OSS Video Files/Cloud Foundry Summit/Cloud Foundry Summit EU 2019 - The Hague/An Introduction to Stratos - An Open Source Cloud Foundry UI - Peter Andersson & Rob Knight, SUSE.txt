	An Introduction to Stratos - An Open Source Cloud Foundry UI - Peter Andersson & Rob Knight, SUSE 

Is your organization making the move to Cloud Foundry, but your operations teams are concerned about learning yet another CLI for managing your deployments? Already using (or planning to use) Kubernetes in your operation? This session will take a closer look at Stratos, the new “Single Pane of Glass” for Cloud Foundry Instance and Application Management that runs on Kubernetes. Stratos is an Open Source, Web-based Graphical User Interface (Console) for managing Cloud Foundry. It allows users and administrators to both manage applications running in the Cloud Foundry cluster and perform cluster management tasks. Todd and Dwain will demonstrate: User access controls, application consumption from CI/CD, application instance controls and more. They will also show how a Containerized Cloud Foundry interfaces with Kubernetes and the Kubernetes Dashboard.
