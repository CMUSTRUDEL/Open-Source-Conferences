zero-scale” is an idea that an application can be reduced down to zero instances when idle and brought back to the required amount of instances when it is needed. It enables better resource efficiency by allowing idling workloads to automatically scale to zero and zero workloads to be automatically re-activated by coming requests.  This session will introduce an experimental project “scale2zero” which implements this feature for Cloud Foundry. We will introduce the user experience, how it works with other Cloud Foundry components like GoRouter, loggregator. We will also talk about future integration into app-autoscaler project and how it will affect and work with dynamic and scheduled scaling.
