Description: 
	Humanising Onboarding: Helping New Team Members Find their Feet in the World of Cloud Foundry - Sapphire Mason-Brown, EngineerBetter 

The world of Cloud Foundry can be difficult to navigate, with a sea of complex components each with their own quirks. For those new to Cloud Foundry, particularly platform teams that maintain Cloud Foundry foundations, this is can be intimidating. Additionally, the process of getting to grips with how Cloud Foundry works is not a speedy one. How can we make the learning process rewarding, not daunting, for new team members? And what do new team members need to be able to deliver value early?  In this talk, Sapphire will explore what psychology tells us about learning and how to leverage this to help new joiners grasp the complexities of Cloud Foundry and gain confidence as members of their team. Whether youâ€™re new to Cloud Foundry or responsible for on-boarding new team members, this talk will leave you with actions you can take to make your on-boarding process as effective as it can be.

hi everybody my name is sapphire I'm an

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,460
engineer with a consultancy called

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,050
engineer better thank you for coming to

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,460
this session you could be anywhere in

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,080
the world right now but you're right

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,109
here with me and I'm eternally grateful

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,730
for that um as part of my role with

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,830
engineer better something I find myself

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,260
doing a lot is helping people learn the

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,019
ins and outs of cloud foundry when

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,240
that's what cloud cloud foundry is

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,480
details about the components that deploy

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,239
cloud foundry and different deployment

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,760
mechanisms like concourse for instance

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,739
as a result I spend a lot of time

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,360
thinking about the most effective ways

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,030
of helping people learn about these

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,129
components without being intimidated by

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,100
the sheer scope of things they need to

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,079
learn I think about helping people stay

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,940
engaged in the learning process and

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,820
continuing to believe that they can

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,620
utilize this learning going forward it's

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,270
not uncommon for companies to struggle

00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,010
to find people who have all of the

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,480
skills and experience using all the

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,500
technologies that are required to

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,619
maintain their Cloud Foundry

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,810
environments and as a result being

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,020
willing to train new starters and doing

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,549
it effectively is crucial

00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,770
additionally beyond having knowledge of

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,810
these technologies team members truly

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,909
come into their own when they're able to

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,040
experiment and infuse their teams with

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,390
innovative new approaches to looking

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,390
after their platforms and technologies

00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:28,380
the scope of what a team maintaining

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,900
cloud foundry environments needs to know

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,430
varies from team to team and one

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,920
important area that all teams will have

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,259
to cover at some point is what cloud

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,290
foundry is and how that particular team

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,509
is the Poynting in for teams using Bosh

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,060
deploy cloud foundry this would include

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,670
what exactly Bosh is easier said than

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,380
done and its role in deploying and

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,110
managing the lifecycle of different

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,420
deployments many teams might create

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,170
their own Bosh releases and that has its

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,909
own very steep learning curve similarly

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,890
some teams will be taking a cube

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,270
aneesa's approach so it'll be essential

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,340
for team members to know exactly how

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,750
cube metis works and how that relates to

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,360
the cloud foundry environments that

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,490
they're looking after and additionally

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,350
Concours is often used

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:18,630
the means of deploying and maintaining

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:22,710
these foundations so it's a lot to learn

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,660
it can be intimidating especially if

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,800
someone is being exposed to all these

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,810
technologies for the very first time so

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,190
how do we help people get to a point of

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,280
which they're comfortable with all these

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,990
technologies and in a position where

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,330
they feel that they can deliver value to

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:44,280
their team the concept of self-efficacy

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,290
is one that's existed for a while and

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,270
that its most basic level it refers to

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,240
whether someone thinks they're able to

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,220
do a particular task successfully say

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,260
they need to deploy a fresh Cloud

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,210
Foundry environment if their first

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,280
thought is that it's rather trivial they

00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,550
could do it without much effort we'll

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,080
say they have high self-efficacy but if

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,850
they're immediately terrified by the

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,010
thought they're not sure where to start

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,100
and it's something they don't think they

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,000
could do because what is Cloud Foundry

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,210
we'd say that they have low

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,800
self-efficacy what summary some research

00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,750
has made broad distinctions between

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,530
those who have self-efficacy and those

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,170
who don't

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,150
but in fact it's a malleable trait that

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,280
can be influenced so if you ever come

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,020
across any experts talking about hiring

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,690
people with high self-efficacy or

00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:34,650
training people with high self-efficacy

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:37,110
ignore them completely there is

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,630
influential source about self-efficacy

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,660
for a given task is performance on the

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,060
same task or given tasks previously past

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,640
successes enhance someone's expectation

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,010
of their own mastery whereas failures

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,630
particularly repeated ones lower these

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,520
mastery expectations

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,440
if someone regularly makes Cloud Foundry

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,990
deployments and more from their lot they

00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,790
occur without issue and more inclined to

00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,100
think that they could continue doing

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,510
that going forward and it would

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,850
positively contribute to their

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,709
self-efficacy whereas if someone had

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,630
never deployed a Cloud Foundry before or

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:13,610
every time they tried had been marred

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:16,650
with issues the opposite would be true

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,750
another contributing source is vicarious

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,880
experience this refers not to the

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,780
behavior of the individual but their

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,970
observing the behavior of

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,070
seeing other people perform tasks

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,740
successfully makes the individual think

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,420
that they too could do the same so if

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,700
other team members are continuously

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,890
deploying and maintaining their

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,180
platforms new starters are more inclined

00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:41,500
to think that they could do the same

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,990
thing going forward how someone feels a

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,910
given time can have a high impact on

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,710
their evaluation of their own competency

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,560
even if they're doing some of they've

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,320
done before if someone is stressed or

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,610
tense or agitated it might lower their

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,770
expectation they'd be able to

00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:03,730
successfully do something another time

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:05,290
and a lot of the time someone's thoughts

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,540
about their own performance don't quite

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,490
match up to reality and in these

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,100
circumstances they benefit from others

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,420
helping them realize their potential

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,200
although it can be limited in its

00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,840
effectiveness

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:22,180
when appraisals are realistic they can

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:24,580
contribute to successful performance so

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,740
how can we realistically boost the self

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,470
efficacy of those entering the world of

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,330
cloud foundry for the first time there

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,250
are many cases for throwing someone in

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,010
at the deep end by to argue that this

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,350
isn't necessarily one of them I say to

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,120
carve out time for learning and give new

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,490
team members the opportunity to dedicate

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,110
time to learning about the platform's

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,670
they'll eventually be maintaining and

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,280
the technology is they'll needs to be

00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,200
confident in this helps make the very

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,200
act of doing their jobs a lot less

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,000
daunting a lot of new starters don't

00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,610
necessarily know what they don't know

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,430
and need some guidance on where to focus

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,170
their attention and how best to proceed

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,210
at engineer better we have an ordered

00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,160
backlog of materials for new starters to

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,010
work through gradually increasing in

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,300
difficulty and it helps everyone develop

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,430
a foundational understanding of

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,050
components like Cloud Foundry Bosch and

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:18,370
concourse so let's look at look back at

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,700
those factors that contribute to

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,680
developing self efficacy if someone's

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,360
just started and they're not coming from

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,550
a team that does anything like what the

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,840
platform team does there are many things

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,330
that they'll be doing that won't be

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,640
reflected in their past performance but

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,440
a foundational level it's like it but

00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,000
some things will even if it is

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,000
just using a command-line interface

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,350
begin with low-level skills and and

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,240
progress the things are more complex in

00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,100
the world of cloud foundry you can start

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,100
with one of the most basic but crucial

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,900
components pushing an application the

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,980
act of pushing an app to Cloud Foundry

00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:59,230
is simple but it's immediately rewarding

00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:02,200
make this success pushing an app the

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,680
past performance then informs the next

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,330
work that people will be working on and

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,330
if they can push an application they're

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,950
ready to create services and so on

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,840
similarly if someone's getting started

00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,660
with Concours if they've reached a stage

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,370
where they can create a job in concours

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:23,290
the possibilities are endless so if you

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,660
can sure that the progression and

00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,890
increases in difficulty in the work that

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,320
new starters are working on is

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,760
reasonable and achievable their past

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:35,800
performance will always be upon a

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:38,020
positive contributor keeping new team

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,450
members abreast of the work of existing

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,860
team members will help them remain aware

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,140
of what they too could be achieving

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,450
eventually the more similar the team

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,750
member for comparison the better so

00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,790
being exposed to the work of other

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:54,940
recent new starters is a bigger

00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,110
self-efficacy boost than those team

00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,100
members who've been on the team for a

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:01,660
longer period of time there's only so

00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,520
much that can be done to moderate the

00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,320
emotions of other people and for the

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,790
most part if you're on someone's team or

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,800
you're managing them the only thing you

00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,360
really have control over is potentially

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,730
the environment they're working within

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,710
and this partly relates to the first

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,169
point I raised which is carving out time

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,510
for people to do that to do the

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,790
foundational learning if there are

00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,830
additional pressures like pressure to

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,510
learn everything within a very fixed

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,710
period of time this can be detrimental

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:33,300
to the learning of new team members and

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,300
cause problems further down the line

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,979
verbal persuasion is more than just

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,620
saying you can do it the comments

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,150
actually be impactful attention needs to

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,360
be paid to both the source of the

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:48,290
feedback and how realistic is unless the

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,350
person to living feedback is gruder's

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,290
you'd as credible and competent it'll be

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,790
viewed as meaningless so people who have

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,590
an understanding of exactly what new

00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,900
learners need to know and are learning

00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,670
and who are also invested in what

00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,460
they're learning are the best people to

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,980
facilitate the whole persuasion and on a

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,200
platform team this would be fellow team

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,360
members or managers with a technical

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,210
understanding of what new starters are

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,560
learning

00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,270
additionally the feedback provided needs

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,150
to be realistic and approach an

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,190
appropriate flippin off off-the-cuff and

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,020
motivational talk isn't very useful

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,990
because it doesn't really give anyone

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,610
something anything to work with and it

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:33,140
does very little to boost someone's

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:35,630
self-efficacy an unrealistic feedback

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,900
can be misleading and eventually result

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,940
in failure and that in turn lowers

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,340
someone's self-efficacy saying for

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,400
instance if you can do a CF push you can

00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,750
create a bas-reliefs is deceptive if you

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,280
don't acknowledge that there is a world

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:54,260
of things that need to be explored

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:56,390
between those two steps high

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,600
self-efficacy continues to be beneficial

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:03,170
beyond initial learning within a team

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,600
and as we know learning within technical

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,370
roles never really ends in cloud foundry

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,960
alone there are continuously new

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,300
features being introduced which have

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,340
their own learning curves so being able

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,490
to continually learn is crucial for

00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,990
those on cloud foundry platform teams

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,090
some researchers have looked into how

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,010
self-efficacy impacts the continued

00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,320
learning of high school teachers at

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,970
school in Flanders using a measure

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,770
called the teachers sense of efficacy

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,200
scale this was a measure of

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,360
self-efficacy as it relates to the tasks

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,310
that teachers do and with specifics of

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,320
school environments they measured

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:39,800
self-efficacy as well as continued

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,090
involvement in continued learning they

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,960
found that teachers who had the highest

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,090
self-efficacy

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,870
were more likely to take part in these

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:50,150
continued learning activities so this

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,720
gives us reason to believe that boosting

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:55,190
self-efficacy does a lot to encourage

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,480
people to continue boosting their

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,820
workplace relevant skills the next

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,460
learning tool I wanted to look at is

00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,230
it's easy to assume that play has no

00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,550
place in the workplace work as a place

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,620
for serious business and the

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,510
infrastructure that underpins a lot of

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,280
very important applications probably

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:17,390
isn't the best playground for new

00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,970
starters when I talk about play I'm

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:22,160
referring to the act of engaging in an

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,110
activity for non serious reasons that

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,220
can be distinguished in some way from

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,480
the real world how does this relate to

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,550
helping new people grasp the

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,710
complexities of cloud foundry and gain

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:38,750
confidence as members of as members of

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:41,510
their team to create my abstract a given

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,340
team might maintain Concours

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,310
environments with a lot of in love

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:50,510
responsibilities including down now

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:53,470
downloading resources creating wash

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:56,900
releases building docket images and

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,970
deploying a platform that utilizes the

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,770
resources Bosh releases and docket

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:04,090
images produced by the other pipelines

00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:06,530
and then there's the platform itself a

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,770
platform that deploys hundreds or

00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,660
thousands of very important applications

00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:14,000
it's safe to say that you wouldn't want

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,770
new status to experiment with or learn

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,590
what Cloud Foundry is within these

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,060
environments it's also quite likely that

00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,890
knowing the importance of these

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,160
environments your new starters don't

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:27,320
want to experiment with them either what

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,150
they need is their own playground their

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,680
own environments separate from the real

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:34,010
wells of the very important applications

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,750
and pipelines giving new starters the

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,940
space the Play equips them with a

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,430
risk-free arena to develop domain

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,900
relevant skills in environments that are

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,180
similar to the real well that they'll

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,010
need to be working win within they're

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,140
given the opportunity to develop skills

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,120
they'll be later utilizing without the

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,080
cognitive load of potentially breaking

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:56,210
and mission critical system errors are

00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,280
particularly useful in learning about

00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,810
how system works but you don't want to

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,460
see them in your production environments

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,290
or even the development environments

00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,240
that people using to test out features

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,300
there are less views

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,339
production one error message can provide

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,950
helpful information about how a given

00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:14,290
component relates to another and the

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,510
language that that component was written

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,430
in with the information that errors

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,649
provides they paved the way for further

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,440
investigation allowing learners to

00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,420
explore more and discover and develop a

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,360
more nuanced understanding of how these

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,880
cloud foundry components work alternate

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,290
additionally in these play environments

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,209
people are less scared of making

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:39,310
mistakes and less inclined to disregard

00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:42,149
errors as anomalies play also has a

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:45,550
positive impact on intrinsic motivation

00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:47,410
intrinsic motivation refers to the

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,750
motivation to engage in a task for the

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,120
sake of it due to an interest or

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,870
enjoyment as opposed to being a means of

00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:58,450
getting a reward or avoiding punishment

00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:01,149
conversely extrinsic motivation stems

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,790
from something external be it goals set

00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:08,170
out by someone else or praise or rewards

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:09,940
in an experiment in the 90s mba students

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,920
had to participate in a task where there

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,709
were either production managers

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,760
performing a learning company company

00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:21,399
exercise or spar ship captains plane the

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,800
word blaster game the task was exactly

00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,050
the same across both conditions it was

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,300
just the name that differed when the

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,950
task was viewers work the ends was

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,709
viewed as more important than the means

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:36,070
and the students were less interested in

00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:38,320
in continuing with it conversely when it

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,060
was viewed as play the means was much

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,470
more important and students were more

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:46,810
motivated to continue in the realm of

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,640
Cloud Foundry there are a few options

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,260
available for presenting new starters

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,990
with play environments for them to

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:57,339
investigate learn and be motivated to

00:14:52,990 --> 00:15:00,040
develop their own lines of inquiry need

00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:01,810
a Cloud Foundry environment CF dev is a

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,910
Cloud Foundry distribution that you can

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,770
run locally on your workstation and it

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,360
gives new stars as a place to experiment

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,160
with deploying applications and

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,089
exploring Cloud Foundry for the very

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,339
first time if you want to explore them

00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:17,769
at Bosch with Bosch and why wouldn't you

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:19,209
there's Bosch light

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:21,429
like provisions you with a Bosch

00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,920
director which you can deploy locally on

00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:26,290
your machine and it allows you to deploy

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,110
Bosch releases as containers as opposed

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,879
to the ends it says this provides a lot

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,829
of visibility into the process of

00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,399
deploying washed director as well as

00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:38,709
developing and testing Bosch releases

00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,989
and with a Bosch light deployed the

00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:43,869
world is your oyster the world of Bosch

00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:45,730
deployment sayers learners are then able

00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:48,149
to deploy their own Concours

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,079
environments or cloud home to deployment

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:53,019
environments on their local machine

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:57,489
they're free to break can mend and break

00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:59,019
and mend to their heart's content and if

00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:01,360
it's possible within their organization

00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:05,369
they can deploy any of these components

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,369
on the is that's available to them

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,920
similar to self efficacy the ability to

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,259
play has benefits they extend beyond

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,809
introduction relearning play can have a

00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:18,429
positive impact on team members paving

00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,799
the way for greater innovation within

00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:23,410
the organization it helps people to

00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,389
think more divergently and find unusual

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,100
mental associations that are separate

00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,069
from the traditional approaches that

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,110
exist within the organization the use of

00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:34,089
play as a path to innovation is

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,220
something it's been demonstrated in a

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:39,819
world of different fields including the

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,129
pharmaceutical industry management and

00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:43,779
organization scholar Alexander style

00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:47,350
looks at drug innovation through the

00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:49,179
lens of Roger colwiz area of play and

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,429
while set out for different types of

00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:55,600
game that are all present that are

00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:57,249
present in all societies be a gun which

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,470
is a type of game in which performance

00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:01,749
is key these the games based on

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,619
competition where some set of skills are

00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:05,130
put to the test

00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:08,529
most sports fall into this category

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,579
there's the Ilia which is a type of game

00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,949
based on chance

00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:13,750
where luck is what determines the victor

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:18,520
this would be a game like snakes and

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:20,949
ladders mimicry is essentially a game of

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,260
make-believe where plays take on some

00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:26,220
sort of role and act outs simulations

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:30,039
like online role-playing games and

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,420
finally there's the ill Nick's come from

00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:33,640
the Greek word for vertigo

00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,460
this refers to games expose players to

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,410
some sort of physical force and movement

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,930
to elicit some sort of emotional

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:44,800
response like riding a roller coaster or

00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:47,020
spinning around until you fall over main

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,710
components were interested here in here

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,570
are the a gun and the earlier spy

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,060
carried out a case study of one of the

00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,300
top five drug companies at the time the

00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,070
time-being 2005 due to the nature of

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,080
drug discovery research it goes without

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,750
saying that a core element of this work

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,210
is skill researchers need to have

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:10,060
knowledge of synthesis chemistry biology

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,150
and pharmacology and without these

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,190
skills the research couldn't be done at

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,510
the time of the study the company in

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,400
question was going through a period of

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,140
transition where they're experiencing

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,080
more management control and greater

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,240
focus on the quantity of drug candidates

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,210
as opposed to opposed to the quality as

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,740
a result they had less time to explore

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:34,210
specific scientific research questions

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,480
this was views being in his in

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,520
opposition to drug discovery as a whole

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,860
one senior scientist said most of the

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,900
greatest discoveries are random the

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,780
chances of exploiting Serendipity's are

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,610
much lower now that's a dilemma because

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,480
you cannot say I'm off to play in the

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,490
lab for a while

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,380
I don't really know what to do by the

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,380
outcome maybe something amazing that

00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:59,290
will be too anti industrial but in fact

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:02,350
it often works that way similarly

00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,210
another doctor said all the interesting

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,120
things I've published have been sown

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:09,310
deputies the study suggests that

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,500
scientific research is based on both the

00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,680
high skill of researchers and the

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,150
element of chance that comes into play

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,120
rather than assuming that scientific

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,460
work operates along linear trajectories

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,320
the study suggests advanced science

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,120
based research can be booked can be

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,270
explored being based on skill and chance

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,910
these ideas of the agon and the Ilia and

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,800
crucially when the opportunities of this

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,320
chance element are being stripped away

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,920
those in the field for less able to do

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,920
their jobs effectively

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,279
I haven't worked in the tech industry

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,289
for a long time and like so many

00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,539
industries it has its own jargon that

00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,919
will you'll grow accustomed to one word

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,529
that always sticks out for me is

00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,470
onboarding and the fact that it can vary

00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:57,830
from place to place so naturally I had

00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,529
to look it up myself to double-check for

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,600
some unloading as viewed it's just the

00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:04,399
process of giving people access to the

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,029
systems they'll eventually need to do

00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:07,909
their jobs

00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:10,130
however for onboarding to be effective

00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:11,779
it needs to leave people thinking that

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,220
they have the skills and knowledge to

00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,440
actually be able to do their jobs

00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,870
effectively and for a Cloud Foundry

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,000
platform team this entails learning

00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:23,720
about a number of complex technologies

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,529
and how they work together so how can we

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,720
do this effectively we can dedicate time

00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:31,390
to creating learning materials for new

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,830
for new starters to work through

00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,760
ensuring that these gradually progressed

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:40,120
in complexity but also given people

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,649
enough of a challenge to motivate them

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,659
we can ensure that new learners are

00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:49,279
given and know that they have time to

00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:51,020
develop their initial understanding we

00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,240
can showcase the work of other team

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,330
members so new so new team members can

00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,399
see what they could eventually do we

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,980
should provide realistic encouragement

00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:05,120
from the right sources to continuously

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:07,429
motivate new starters and need to ensure

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,260
that they have space and time to play in

00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:12,409
environments that they know will not be

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,179
disruptive to the wider team like a lot

00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,190
of practices and approaches that are

00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,529
introduced to support a core set of

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,409
people these stand to benefit anyone

00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:23,330
much like new team members existing ones

00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:26,090
also benefit from the high self-efficacy

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:30,679
and the scopes of play helping deliver

00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:32,600
value in innovation to the business you

00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:33,830
can find the references to the research

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,620
that I mentioned throughout their

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,419
presentation at this link here and I'll

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,980
be - the state to the side of the stage

00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:42,080
if you have any questions or want to

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,440
discuss anything in further detail thank

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,589
