Description: 
	Seeing the Forest for the Trees: An Operator’s Guide to Observability of CF with Metric Store - Todd Persen, Pivotal 

In this talk, Todd will introduce a recently-released component of CF called Metric Store and discuss how it is becoming an invaluable tool to cut through the noise of streaming, ephemeral metrics. Instead of simply pulling metrics out of Loggregator with a nozzle, Metric Store will provide operators with the ability to analyze long-living metrics about platform health and performance, while also offering a richer interaction with developers as they build and deploy new applications.
