Description: 
	Implementing the Schedulers: A Look at the Internals of Diego and Eirini - Nima Kaviani, IBM & Jen Spinney, Pivotal 

How does Cloud Foundry know where and how to run your app? It started with Droplet Execution Agents (DEAs) as the backend scheduler. Then, we re-architected Cloud Foundry to replace DEAs with the more-maintainable Diego. Today, with Eirini, we allow you to choose between Diego and Kubernetes as the scheduler. Cloud Foundry operators who are considering the switch from Diego to Eirini may find it valuable to know the key differences and how to troubleshoot the new Eirini/Kubernetes scheduler.  Nima and Jen have been contributors to both Diego and Eirini and have a deep understanding of the internal details of both. In this talk, they will do an in-depth comparison of the components of Diego and Eirini. They will discuss design differences across the two schedulers, and compare the pros and cons of each environment. They will also cover common debugging and troubleshooting tips for both.
