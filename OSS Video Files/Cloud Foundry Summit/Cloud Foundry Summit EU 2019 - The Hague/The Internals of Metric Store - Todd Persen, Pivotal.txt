Description: 
	The Internals of Metric Store - Todd Persen, Pivotal 

In this talk, Todd will walk through the high-level source code of Metric Store and highlight its key components - ingress via Loggregator, persistence with the InfluxDB storage engine, querying using PromQL, and authorization with the CF Auth Proxy. After a thorough tour of this codebase, attendees should have a good grasp on the architecture and be able to build new applications that leverage the features of Metric Store and contribute to the open source project if they so desire.
