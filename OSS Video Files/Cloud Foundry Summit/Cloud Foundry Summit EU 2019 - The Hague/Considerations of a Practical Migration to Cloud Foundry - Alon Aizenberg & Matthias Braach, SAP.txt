	Considerations of a Practical Migration to Cloud Foundry - Alon Aizenberg & Matthias Braach, SAP 

In the past year, we migrated our product and teams from an Infrastructure as a Service to Cloud Foundry. We will be happy to share our view on a practical migration of existing software products to Cloud Foundry, including reasoning about choosing a PaaS, migration pitfalls, best practices, application changes which you must do, and changes you should avoid doing. Attending this session you will learn our view on the optimal way to migrate existing applications and teams to work with Cloud Foundry.
