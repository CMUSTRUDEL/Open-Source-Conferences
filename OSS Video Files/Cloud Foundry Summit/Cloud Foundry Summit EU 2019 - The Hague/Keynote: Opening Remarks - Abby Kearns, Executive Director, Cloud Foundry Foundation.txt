good morning that was really sad it's

to have you all here it's so exciting to

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,220
be in Europe again we have chosen a new

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,890
location for those of you that have been

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,439
coming for several years we are not in

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,779
Basel this year we were there was a

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,099
steady stream of his showing up in Basel

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,110
I think people thought we were gonna

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,950
officially decamp to Switzerland

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,440
but we are so happy to be here in the

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,840
Netherlands and thank you all for

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,460
joining us so today is day one of a

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,680
couple of days we're gonna all get to

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,460
spend time together and I'm super

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,719
excited about it today we have an

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:02,010
amazing line-up of speakers and a few

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,559
demos and I am super excited to share

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,640
the stage with an amazing roster of

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,869
people but first I'm going to do a

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,869
little bit of a monologue

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:19,310
this is a caterpillar

00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:22,039
you may be asking yourself why is Abby

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:26,750
showing me a picture of a caterpillar at

00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:28,610
a cloud conference well a caterpillar is

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,289
implementing of something that I've

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:35,259
spent a lot of time thinking about over

00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:35,259
the last couple of years transformation

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,790
see a caterpillar weaves a cocoon

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,020
disappears for a few weeks and then

00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:49,650
emerges as a butterfly transformed its

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,650
magic right

00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:55,060
but now how about something completely

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,990
different this is a wide whitewater

00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:02,049
kayaker she's always alert always in

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:06,759
motion always trying to figure out how

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:10,060
to move forward the waters around her

00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:13,030
constantly shifting she must react to

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,150
the forces in the moment one moment at a

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:23,230
time this isn't magic

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:26,110
it's mastery so let's talk about

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,569
Enterprises today some of you work for

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,269
enterprises some of you don't but let's

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:33,849
all pretend that we right now work for

00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,530
an enterprise there's something I'm

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:40,239
really empathetic about these days

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,920
because it's a very tough job what does

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,040
is you're in an enterprise what is your

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,900
existing technology portfolio look like

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,970
where do you want to go are you being as

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,349
innovative and iterating as quickly as

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:57,940
you possibly can in fact are you a

00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:59,170
caterpillar or you a kayaker because if

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,859
you listen to the language around

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,480
digital transformation today we in the

00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:06,280
enterprise we're weaving our cocoons

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,400
we're gonna disappear for a few months

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,630
and then we're gonna emerge transformed

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,430
we're done we're digitally transformed

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,430
we're there we've accomplished our goal

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:20,920
but we all know the journey is a little

00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,780
harder than that because real

00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,660
transformation is not adopt about

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,900
adopting a shiny new technology or a

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,150
couple of new technologies it's about

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,560
adapting to a world that's now ordered

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,930
around technology the next new and shiny

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,819
thing is actually a river rapid of new

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:45,040
and shiny things and it's not slowing

00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:48,099
down so the reality is we're all

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,319
kayakers now the waters are going to

00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:54,340
keep shifting around us and changing and

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:57,430
we're going to have to figure out how to

00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,100
navigate those rapids our strengths will

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,380
be tested and our successfully measured

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,380
by our ability to master these new rap

00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:15,459
but what does this mean for you and the

00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,019
work that you're doing well as we think

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,079
about the future we need to make sure

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,320
that we have plans for learning

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:26,010
continuously learning and adapting it

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,139
means that choice is critical and

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,900
finally an importantly abstraction is

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:34,540
paramount we need to be able to extract

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:40,570
the technologies and give us the option

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:46,270
ality as we evolve so whether you're a

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:47,400
CIO CEO o software developer or lead of

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,870
your business

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,229
you're gonna have to focus on horizons

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:56,800
further ahead then the next new and

00:04:53,229 --> 00:05:00,160
shiny thing because in order for it to

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,220
be successful we need systems in place

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,810
that allow for our organizations to take

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,410
advantage of these new tools and

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:12,030
technologies as they come up

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,030
ultimately making your business better

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,610
because the pace of change is

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:26,200
accelerating everything is accelerating

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:29,590
I believe today organizations are forced

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,229
to reckon with this change there's a

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,990
river rapid of change ahead and there's

00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,729
no getting out of this boat we're just

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:44,229
gonna have to learn how to master the

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:47,260
rapids so today 69 percent of IT

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:50,310
decision-makers say that digital

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:55,000
transformation is extremely important

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,260
and that number continues to grow from

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,870
my unique vantage point

00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:02,050
I predict that organizations that can

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,849
adapt to this pace of change not just

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,820
the one-time change but adapt to this

00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:10,770
pace those are the colors those are the

00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:15,219
companies that will win in other words

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,389
we need better kayakers you see where

00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:21,099
I'm going with this now

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:26,110
yeah but what does it mean to be a

00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:28,060
better kayaker well in order to think

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,430
about that let's revisit the original

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,740
intent of digital transformation before

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:36,610
it became a buzzword or something we all

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:39,550
rolled our eyes at the core ideals of

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,860
digital transformation where we would

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,729
like as a company to be more responsive

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:48,099
to changing customer needs changing

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:50,819
technologies changes in the market we'd

00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:53,710
like to be able to fail faster and

00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:59,020
finally we'd like to be able to iterate

00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:02,349
and innovate more and to do that we need

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:07,120
to build for the future with plans for

00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:10,569
learning systems for choice and we can

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,469
do that in a very powerful way because

00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:16,150
we can abstract away the complexity of

00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:17,259
having to make that one choice that

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,560
you're going to spend the rest of your

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:22,120
life with and so when we talk about

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,099
digital transformation what we're

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,270
talking about actually is just software

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:35,500
as strategy and this all hinges on one

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:41,259
thing developers so at Cloud Foundry our

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:45,909
vision has continued to be how do we

00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:47,949
continuously build for the future to

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:51,009
ensure that all of our community members

00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:53,229
our users the people within the Cloud

00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:58,349
Foundry community are able to build

00:07:53,229 --> 00:08:01,919
viable businesses for the long term in

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:05,800
short we want you to be better kayakers

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:08,259
we want you to build for the future but

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:13,060
to do that we must adapt to change

00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:14,830
faster embrace multi-platform and most

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,909
importantly engage in open source

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,629
because we're in an open-source

00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:23,529
conference but what does that actually

00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:25,630
mean it means that our vision of an

00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:29,289
integrated platform that provides the

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,270
best experience for developers is still

00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:35,010
relevant to

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:39,360
day but we also need to evolve and

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:41,160
change balancing quickly changing

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,940
technologies particularly in the cloud

00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:49,820
native space but continuing to hear to

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,820
our core vision the developer experience

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,520
so we've always been evolving at Cloud

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,170
Foundry for many years

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,430
Iranian quarks represent just the latest

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:07,380
in that evolution the Marchi the market

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,970
is catching up with our relentless focus

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,640
on the developer experience I don't know

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,680
if you've noticed that but developers

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,920
are super important to everyone these

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,960
days the kubernetes community is

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,050
reaching out and asking for our help on

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:28,790
the developer experience and it's time

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:31,800
for us to answer that call in fact today

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,250
most users and and most of you are

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,150
running a variety of technologies new

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,220
stuff is going to continue to come along

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:45,150
regardless of what comes next though our

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,400
North Star is still going to continue to

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:50,430
be to provide the best developer

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:57,600
experience irrespective of the platform

00:09:50,430 --> 00:10:01,230
and the technology but we're an open

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:06,180
source which is an amazing place to be

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:09,420
these days open source is fueled 100%

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,520
though by an engaged community and it's

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,860
our goal every year to continue to

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,010
improving the experience of our

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,650
developers to cultivate that community

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:23,220
and to strengthen the ecosystem that

00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:26,850
supports all of this because ultimately

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,650
open-source is a virtuous cycle when we

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,810
free up developers and allow them to

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,850
focus on innovation they add even

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:38,070
greater value to the enterprise in fact

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,890
66% of enterprise IT decision-makers say

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,740
that open-source unlocks value for their

00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:49,080
organization so open source remade

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:52,530
a key strategy in Cloud Foundry we

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,380
automate everything the goal is to allow

00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,210
developers to focus on fixing less on

00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:01,140
fixing problems and more on building new

00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:03,540
solutions and they can bring that back

00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,240
to the platform back to the community

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:10,650
back to the technology that's at our

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:14,220
core by contributing ideas feedback and

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:17,040
code this strengthens the entire

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:21,300
ecosystem which leads to stronger

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:24,320
developers and a stronger ecosystem and

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:32,520
when that cycle is working at its best

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:35,460
it's all of you the benefit in addition

00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,010
to these long-held goals we continue to

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,260
work with you our community to deliver

00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,550
the best open source developer

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:47,870
experience for the entire industry

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:52,790
this means largely on top of kubernetes

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:56,010
with the arena and corks projects but

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:59,400
let's not forget what got us here this

00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:02,010
is all built on the amazing work and the

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,880
years and years of development effort

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:10,050
put into building the cloud foundry that

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,210
we know today projects like Diego have

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:17,070
made cloud foundry the success that it

00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:18,990
is in fact over half the Fortune 500 are

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:24,750
shaping the future of their companies on

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:26,730
cloud foundry right now and I want to

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:31,140
talk about a few of those companies here

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,160
today we're in the Netherlands so we

00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:38,940
just thought we'd start with another

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:40,890
lens Bank a local bank robber bank rebel

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,250
Bank is the third largest bank in the

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:48,920
Netherlands they've been running Cloud

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:51,720
Foundry for many years now for them

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:55,140
they've been able to scale up to three

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,130
hundred teams something their previous

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,930
platform couldn't have

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:05,280
but most importantly all of this is

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:07,500
managed by two people and they've been

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:14,000
able to scale up to 900 application

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:18,930
instances let's talk about another

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,680
company Telus for those of you from the

00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:24,270
UK probably recognize the brand they're

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,400
the largest aerospace and defense

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:31,140
contractor they started off with their

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,040
journey with a digital factory with just

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:37,380
10 people in Paris that's now Scouts

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,650
scaled up to more than 200 in the

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,720
digital factory and they're opening new

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,380
digital factories across the world today

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,560
for them they've been able to speed up

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,390
their MVP process achieve high degrees

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,180
of application availability and most

00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:57,690
importantly allow their developers to

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,400
spend most of their time coding is that

00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,100
where we all want to be right spending

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:08,160
our time coding writing products and

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:10,260
getting them into the market and last

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:15,840
but certainly not least they'd want to

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:17,490
shout out to sky a uk-based media and

00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,630
telecom provider that I believe we're

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:24,620
all familiar with even in the u.s. with

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:29,540
23 million customers across Europe

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:31,680
they're a very big presence in the world

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,050
they've been running Cloud Foundry for

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,250
many years have been able to scale up to

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,770
3,000 requests per second for their

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:43,440
mobile services they've got more than

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,360
300 developers working on new

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,810
applications and new services and new

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,830
capabilities and they're able to use

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,630
across 4,000 containers using this

00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,040
platform to address a lot of their

00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:00,570
streaming services that they've built

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:03,690
out today these are just a few of the

00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,040
amazing companies that exist within the

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:09,720
Cloud Foundry community that are doing

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,320
amazing things not because Cloud Foundry

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,720
is

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,120
an amazing technology because it is but

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,710
because they're able to leverage that to

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,830
achieve the real outcome which is

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:22,980
developing new applications innovating

00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:28,320
and iterating quickly getting those

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:31,170
ideas into market and all of this is

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:37,020
made possible by you the Cloud Foundry

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:39,810
community I've shown you these logos

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:44,060

serve the full spectrum of user and I'm

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,250

difficult it's not an easy journey but

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:29,370

the future we need to embrace change as

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:54,570
a community and as I've often say it

00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:59,880
change is hard but it can be really

00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:02,340
rewarding at the end and to the

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,060

more engaged you can contribute yes that

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:39,149
means code but also time ideas feedback

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,100
every single one of those things are

00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:42,570
deeply important to both how Cloud

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,659
Foundry continues to evolve as a

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:51,110
technology but then also how we as a

00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:51,110
community continuously grow and evolve

00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:57,600
anyone who's learned to master the rush

experience what you've never seen before

00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:21,919
to build for the future but most

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,919
importantly have fun
