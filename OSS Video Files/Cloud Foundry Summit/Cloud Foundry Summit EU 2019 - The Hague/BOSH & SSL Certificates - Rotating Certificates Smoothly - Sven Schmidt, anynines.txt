	BOSH & SSL Certificates - Rotating Certificates Smoothly - Sven Schmidt, anynines 

Rotating certificates in BOSH can lead to disastrous outages leaving Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes environments broken.  This session will tell you the 101 of SSL & TLS protocols in a BOSH world. Find out how BOSH & Credhub handle the creation, deletion and rotation of certificates differently and why it is so much harder to deal with certificates than with other naive secret types. See how you can cause a director “meltdown” during rotations and learn to avoid them in your own production environments.  You will leave this session with a step by step plan on how to rotate certificates in any BOSH based environment without downtime, avoiding the most common pitfalls.
