good morning everyone let's get started

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,580
welcome to cloud fairy 101 I'm doctor

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:15,210
Gao a clan leader and a single cloud

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,300
engineer at dark and Wayne yeah good

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,760
morning also from my side now we also

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,000
have the photo of us my name is Matthias

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,619
I work for a company called Nova Tech

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,930
which you're gonna be the co-chairs for

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,539
this track for the next two days so

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,489
please in case you want to know anything

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,710
if something is unclear whatsoever you

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,000
can ask us anything we try to be here

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,000
for you all the time

00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:47,340
ok so I'm gonna start with with this

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,469
light real quick just to just to

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,199
introduce that that talk I mean we've

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,870
been busy in the last weeks to select

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,370
and align the talks for for the next two

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,789
days and and this was a lot harder than

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,489
I thought

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,920
I have never done this before and the

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,449
way we did it I mean we were basically

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,309
look look at that cow foundry and say

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,659
what will people need to know in order

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,770
to get started what are the relevant

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,900
topics what are the relevant

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,479
technologies that surround the ecosystem

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,590
and you'll probably see a lot of I mean

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,970
I'm not gonna read through all of them

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,610
but you see all the ones that have been

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:22,200
mentioned in the keynotes like ireenie

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,390
and quarks Porsche so we try to make a

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,770
bit of a wide selection to make sure

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,380
we're not we're not focusing on one

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,130
particular area but we cover a big range

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,420
and in case you plan to spend the next

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,400
two days in here you should be very

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,869
familiar with the with the cloud foundry

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,210
echo system yeah Majesty the burgoo the

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,390
summary about how it's like to talk what

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,689
do we select just adding to that I want

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,720
to say there's lots of good at Hawks

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,369
estava made it I want to thank for thank

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,610
all of those people who submitted talks

00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:00,060
and we had a hard time to pick we want

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,430
of them peace keep speaking today but we

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,310
cannot I thought that's the only problem

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,640
I have I go shopping for dresses one

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,700
after me cannot but anyways let's see

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,860
the schedule so day one if you go online

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,710
under the side you

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,100
filter by the track your see something

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,300
like this to break it out so we have a

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,130
beginner's guide so it will give you

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,610
introduction about CF concepts as a

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,220
whole system it also have talks for

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:36,290
herself how you are going to deploy CF

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,570
and there are many ways to deploy CF

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:42,990
regardless what we you use underneath it

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:46,940
is the pouch use the brush to deploy so

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:50,370
we have about one one for that purpose

00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,620
how can we have CF one one without

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,800
talking about the applications so we

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:59,160
have two talks no matter you are the new

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,770
user just push your first two CF app to

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,230
your cloud sorry oh you want Megara to

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:09,030
your existing IP to cloud sorry you are

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:12,900
all covered then we will wrap up our

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:17,880
first day use our cute fancy beautiful

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,560
you ice rattles alright so I'm gonna

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,310
walk with you quickly through the

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,080
selection of day to where I'm gonna be

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,959
actually taking part also as a presenter

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,730
in the first track I'm not gonna read

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,250
through them now I'll try to visualize

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:36,090
in a similar way as dr. gallo just did

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,610
so on this day we basically have one

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,880
general introduction talk that's the

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:45,140
Cloud Foundry for for everyone the other

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,570
ones will basically be a bit of a mix of

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,570
various technologies and also lessons

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,930
learned using those technologies so of

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,000
course also focus will be on application

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,250
development and deployment to the

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,230
platform and usage of the platform this

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,269
will be done on an example with with

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,820
spring boot we're going to talk about

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,440
build packs to make every sure everybody

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,500
understands the concept of build packs

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,410
how they're being used internet foundry

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:15,150
CLI plugins is an interesting thing for

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,519
people getting started so they can

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,410
enhance the Cloud Foundry experience by

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,120
writing them themself and extend the

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,729
functionalistic scope there so there

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,860
will be an introduction to that

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,389
kubernetes is of course a big topic

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,180
everywhere I mean we don't have

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,699
like full getting started and learn

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,249
kubernetes everything this would

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,710
probably be too big for it for that

00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:40,409
session but this is like more to focus

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,419
on kubernetes from a quarks and ireenie

00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:46,409
perspective which makes it very relevant

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:49,229
to to Cloud Foundry and then also the

00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:52,110
service broker API to basically learn

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:55,020
how to attach external systems to your

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,300
to your Cloud Foundry environment so I

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,340
hope you're all happy with the selection

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,960
that we picked as we just said it was

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,669
very hard we had a lot of other talks

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,560
that we could have selected as well and

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,860
was really hard for us to do like not

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,960
include everyone and so with that we

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:15,439
just can say have fun happy learning and

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,439
thanks for being here

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,490
