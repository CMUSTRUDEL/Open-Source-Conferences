Description: 
	Cloud Foundry in Simple Terms: A Beginner's Journey - Gloria Dwomoh 

"Cloud is someone else's computer". Have you heard that line before? This gives a basic explanation to what cloud computing is and maybe it could be a convincing enough answer to explain what cloud is to a 5 year old without additional questions. But can Cloud Foundry be as simple? In this talk, Gloria will start from the ground up like what does cloud mean up till what is Cloud Foundry, in simple terms, while exploring some of its intricacies. At the end, you'd have a better understanding of some of the key fundamental concepts surrounding cloud and Cloud Foundry.

welcome to my talk my name is Gloria

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,570
jumo I'm a computer systems engineer and

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:12,960
this is a introductory introductory talk

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,179
about cloud computing cloud foundry will

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,789
start from the very very basic kind of

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,340
like learning ABCD and then go into the

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,130
more complicated stuff in order to build

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,410
up from the easy to the hardware and

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,080
also create a good foundation so that

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,410
things can be easier for you in the next

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,329
talks this talk came as an inspiration

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,270
from an experience I had some years back

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,890
in an interview before the interviewer

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,579
actor recruited ready to prepare

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,379
anything

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,750
I was oh no you don't need to prepare

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,370
anything when I went to the interview

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,930
and one thing I was asked is what is

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,100
cloud computing what do you know about

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,899
cloud computing and then I was like in

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,390
my mind of course I've heard about it

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,969
but I'm not really sure what to say

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,710
let me say what I know but then after

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,379
that interview I got a feedback learn

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,110
more about cloud computing it is the

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,510
future of infrastructure and since then

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,909
is when I began searching about what

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,619
cloud computing is and how can I make it

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,540
easier for other people to understand

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,460
because I said a computer engineering

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,340
I had like a technical background but

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,189
still it was an abstract concept that

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,000
was kind of hard for me to fully

00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:23,460
understand what it meant

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,979
so with that came this talk and I hope

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,380
that what you learn today gives you the

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,450
good fundamental knowledge to make the

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:38,780
other talks understandable for you and

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:38,780
approachable so let's start yep

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:52,060
outside things from Arthur it's from all

00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,060
other

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:09,630
okay so yeah now hopefully I can

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,280
continue cool background music so the

00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,710
first thing that we'll talk about is one

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,320
of the most asked questions in

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,690
interviews is explained next to someone

00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,780
and that usually is to explain a very

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,580
complicated concept to someone in order

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,930
for them to see how well you are in

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:33,600
breaking down various concepts and in

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:36,420
our talk the X will be cloud so I

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,580
decided to consult the social media

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,420
warriors to give me an explanation of

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,060
what cloud means and when I did that I

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,540
got various rail responses the first one

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,720
that I got is this one here as I can

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,340
imagine but it's exactly what most of

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,060
you first thought when you hear the word

00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:01,230
cloud and there's a research that was

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,720
done by Citrix in 2012 and there the

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,700
sale at first mind when asked about what

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,799
cloud computing is the majority thought

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,959
that it was a cloud in the sky or

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,510
something related to the weather so it's

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,220
actually real that a good amount of

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,019
people still don't fully understand what

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,360
cloud computing is but there are people

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,860
that do know and that's a good thing so

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,739
that is why we will begin with a very

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,630
fundamental parts but Sushil the social

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,870
media wars the rest of their to give me

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:33,150
a reality check by giving me this man

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:36,150
here and it's like okay cloud computing

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,239
is just someone else computer so that

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,760
made me wonder kids not the skies it's

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,100
someone else computer and that can make

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,170
someone a bit paranoid it makes you

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,940
wonder if someone has computer could be

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,470
a co-worker's computer and they are

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,010
spying on you and then you have like a

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:55,410
third party person behind the scenes

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,239
looking at what you are doing but no

00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,860
that is not what cloud computing is and

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,260
eventually the best response came

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,110
through this man here which is like the

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,700
closest one of the best explanations

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,440
that I've seen yeah it's one of the best

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,050
explanations that I've seen so far like

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:17,310
Daddy what a cloud made of Linux servers

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:20,820
mostly yes that is actually true so with

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:24,000
that being said let's take things a bit

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,100
backwards let's do a history walkthrough

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,100
with how cloud computing first came

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,290
about so we first had something called

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:36,210
the monolith which was like centralized

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:38,970
computing all the peripherals and was

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,020
controlled by one central computer with

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:47,070
these complex computations as well and

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:49,170
that gave pave the way for monolithic

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,930
applications which are applications that

00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,370
run as one unit and that work come from

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,580
the world monolith which is a Greek

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,380
world become but Manos means alone and

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,300
then let us mean stone so everything is

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:07,710
like one unit one unified stone and

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:11,580
after that we had like we needed change

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,110
because this made things to be costly

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,900
because you needed to upgrade your

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,390
systems each time you needed like more

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,850
bandwidth for users and other things and

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,260
it was hard to support a lot of users

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:26,550
concurrently so that way the way to

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:31,130
decentralized systems distributed

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:34,440
computing which was a great advancement

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:37,140
in technology and it enabled

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,590
organizations to be able to scale the a

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:44,270
project by having no upfront hardware

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:48,180
costs and that is how cloud computing

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,700
came about and also that enabled

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,950
organization to leverage leverage third

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:57,450
party infrastructure instead of having

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:59,820
their own so now we know what cloud

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:03,330
computing is we know what cloud is by

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,980
what is cloud computing and here I say

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,850
that cloud of hearing is the ability to

00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,770
deliver services over the Internet that

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,380
is like the simplest way to put it and

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:20,940
as we go along you be able to see more

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:23,270
of us we mean by services so I wanted to

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,940
see a bit about what is the cloud

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:29,129
infrastructure

00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,750
the cloud architecture usually has like

00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,879
a front and side which is like the

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,620
client infrastructure and then he has

00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:39,180
like the back inside which is like the

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:42,240
stories the cloud runtime and more more

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,069
things so it's kind of like the way we

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,259
have application sets today that it has

00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:50,520
the front end and then the back end and

00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:54,539
then we have something else which is

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,629
called a cloud service model which is

00:06:54,539 --> 00:07:00,539
what we have seen like X as a service so

00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:05,039
people say like let's say infrastructure

00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:07,050
as a service or platform as a service

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,090
they have different names for that and

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,969
that is any service that can be

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,370
delivered to a vendor or an organization

00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:19,770
through the internet with the use of

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:21,270
cloud computing so let's see few of the

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,699
common ones that you might come across

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,949
today in other talks or you might have

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,020
seen or you will see in the future one

00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:30,440
of them is infrastructure as a service

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:37,860
and you often see it as an abbreviation

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:40,279
they I a yes years I see and that is is

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,740
there it's like the provisioning of

00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:47,099
fundamental tools things like virtual

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,270
machines or physical machines resources

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:53,159
in order to be able to run your

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:55,710
application and that is like platforms

00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,639
like Google Google cloud platform or the

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:02,190
Microsoft Azure that some people use to

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,430
run use in conjunction with cloud

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,430
foundry

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,740
and infrastructure as a service it

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,260
provides us as a virtual machines and

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:18,920
other components that are made available

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,690
through visualization so then we have

00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,460
software as a service and software as a

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,580
service is any type of software that

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:29,830
runs online in the internet consists in

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:34,000
the abbreviation of SaaS and that is

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:40,100
software's like let's say Gmail CMS

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,720
content management systems and then we

00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,140
have something else like identity as a

00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:48,440
service which is being able to have like

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,180
a digital authentication system where

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,880
each user is able to use a single

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,750
password for example to sign in on all

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,430
the systems of your organization and the

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,650
last example that would be because

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,390
there's much more than this for that

00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,670
I'll say here but these are some basics

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,800
that you see often they're good to know

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,260
the last one that I will speak about is

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,460
platform as a service and I've put a

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,530
star here and we'll step a bit more into

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:20,390
this because this is very related to

00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:23,480
Cloud Foundry so what is platform as a

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,820
service so platform as a service is a

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,790
model that of offers runtime for

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,240
applications and also the tools needed

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,150
to deploy and develop your applications

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,780
and that exact that is exactly what

00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:41,560
Cloud Foundry does so knowing that let's

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:46,360
move on into what cloud foundry is which

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:49,790
hopefully a lot of you know already so

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,870
cloud foundry is a open source cloud

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:57,790
application that helps you to deploy

00:09:52,870 --> 00:10:01,220
Enterprise enterprise cloud applications

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,680
and cloud foundry makes things easier

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:08,600
for you in relation to the traditional

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:11,750
IT or the infrastructure as a service

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,150
platforms so what it does is that it

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,430
makes you have to manage fewer things

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,640
that you will have had if you didn't use

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,820
cloud foundry

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,380
so with Cloud Foundry you manage the

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,140
application and the data you see in this

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,660
diagram here and then Cloud Foundry

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,390
manages all of these other things in the

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,490
infrastructure as a service which we

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,709
explained what it was previously and

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,589
here is some example of it like Amazon

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:40,740
Web Services whisper OpenStack and so on

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:49,320
and it does that it helps us do that

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:53,399
with the use of Bosch and we have to see

00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,160
like what boss exactly does both unifies

00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,470
the release engineering deployment and

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,810
lifecycle management so that is how it's

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,269
a able to handle a lot of these things

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,529
here we showed here cloud phone is able

00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:10,160
to handle all these things we have

00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:13,589
showed here through the use of Bosch and

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,260
both also makes it easy to roll back

00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:20,760
when you have like some issues with your

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:24,240
updates or yeah you have done something

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,949
wrong and also both is commonly used by

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,110
cloud foundry

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:30,029
because cloud foundry needs various

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,149
boundaries of virtual machines in order

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:36,300
to run so what is what is commonly used

00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,899
for that and also as you see in the

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,089
slides

00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:45,390
it creates an employee's virtual

00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:49,050
machines so these are a few of the

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:51,180
benefits of using Cloud Foundry one of

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,420
the very important one is it here it

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,699
helps with vertical and horizontal

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,310
scaling and a lot of platforms that have

00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:03,990
a lot of users need to continuously

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:08,670
scale and this is how feel there is a

00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:10,649
cloud fund we can help you so how does

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,959
Cloud Foundry help you focus on

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,209
development while it handles all the

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,970
other things for you behind the scenes

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:20,209
like the virtual machines creating

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,620
containers and all those type of things

00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:25,860
we'll see that through exploring what

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,160
happens when we do share push which is

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,740
pushing an application

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,920
- with the use of Cloud Foundry to the

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:37,240
cloud so first we have the Cloud Foundry

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,610
controller and what it does is help us

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,420
if I help us find the needed build

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:46,070
package we'll see what it is next

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:49,250
the cloud phonic controller is like the

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,770
brain of the process and it manages the

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:55,180
entire application lifecycle from the

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:59,570
beginning to the very end

00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:02,120
so after CF controller finds the needed

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:08,150
build pack what build pack does is it

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:11,540
creates an application image and in

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:13,070
short this is what built pack does it

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,920
help us to identify the necessary

00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,690
dependencies to configure the app so for

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,080
example if the app you're uploading is

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:24,020
made on Ruby on Rails bill pack is able

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,930
to identify that through a process here

00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,280
but Bill pack goes through for example

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,650
it goes through the tech ten first

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,390
detecting if you actually need any bill

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,760
packs and after that it supplies the

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,950
dependencies you need so for example on

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:41,660
the Ruby on Rails example that I gave it

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:43,460
will help you install the necessary like

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,430
gems or any other things that you need

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:49,550
to run your application and once that is

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,800
done it provided feedback to Cloud

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:58,370
Foundry indicating how it should execute

00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:01,400
your application and then once Bill pack

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,950
has created that image Diego comes and

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,350
take that that image is called droplet

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:11,140
and it runs it in a container called

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:16,180
Diego cell so now we see what Diego is

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:22,130
and insert Diego helps us manage

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:26,120
application containers so we'll look a

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:28,190
bit of what Diego does I'll spin like

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,890
part of it because like Diego can be a

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:34,460
full talk of its own so what happens is

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:36,200
that when we do the CF post the cloud

00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,600
controller which we said that is like

00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,600
the brain of

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:45,710
the process I have mana stains it passes

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,130
the request to the BBS which is the

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:52,310
bulletin board system and it's a thatís

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:55,370
it's a central data store that allows us

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:58,900
to store various information about our

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:03,770
application so what it does is that the

00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:05,660
bulletin board system stores the things

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,830
that we have passed through in the

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:13,510
request in the database and then after

00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:20,540
that it creates an auction via auktioner

00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:25,010
which then finds the right cell for us

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:28,250
to run the application by consulting

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:31,490
with rep here which accepts the AWS

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:36,020
action request and then what that does

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,940
is it executes what we have given to it

00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,820
through creating something that we call

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:44,690
a garden container which is what this

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:49,900
thing here is and by the creation of the

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:53,060
garden container it downloads like every

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:56,120
information we have given in the droplet

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:59,390
image the resulted from the staging

00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,780
process we did before and it enables us

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:05,720
to run the Cloud Foundry application

00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,580
that we have given to it so the other

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,770
things that it does here we won't really

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:13,310
dive into it because it's not very

00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:16,220
relevant to our talk right now but you

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:21,710
can read more about it through this link

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:24,890
here that I've written as a source so

00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:27,260
let's see a bit about the best practices

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,770
when it comes to creating cloud native

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,930
application and by a cloud native

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,640
application I mean cloud native I mean

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:42,380
applications that are designed to run on

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:45,080
the cloud primarily so there was the

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,360
creation of something called fair factor

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,910
methodology in the initial stages of

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,510
cloud computing as people try to find

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,180
like

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,460
lines of like what is the best practices

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,800
that we can follow to create cloud

00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,170
native applications and that means

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,950
applications that were primarily created

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:06,020
to run in the cloud first so the 12

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,000
factor methodology gives us like 12

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:12,079
different factors that a application

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,130
have to have in order to be portable and

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,110
every silent when deploy to the web so I

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,110
won't speak about that all the 12-hour

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:23,150
focus on two of them right now which are

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,390
relevant what we are speaking one of

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,070
them is dependencies one of the things

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,530
that it says is the application have to

00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:33,410
have dependencies and that is something

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,470
that build pack manages reads we spoke

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,360
about before that it finds the it finds

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,250
the dependencies that our application

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,500
need in order to run efficiently in the

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:46,730
cloud and another thing that we are

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:49,010
going to see is processes your

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,140
application has to be able to run on

00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:58,480
multiple servers and for that to happen

00:17:51,140 --> 00:18:01,760
you have to be able to use processes and

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,520
as we said before the application needs

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,960
to run multiple servers so that is one

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,610
thing that we have to know about

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,540
processes and the other things is that

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:14,930
web applications are stateless so every

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:17,300
request to the web isn't safe is seen as

00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:21,620
a you it's seen as a you request so if

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,000
we want to save the state that we are in

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,700
right now we have to use something that

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,030
is called backing services which is also

00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:31,880
called like storage and so the thing is

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:37,250
that we are spoken about a 12 factor and

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:39,470
one of the components in it is as we

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,050
said processes and data pieces are

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:46,130
decoupled from stateless applications

00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:49,370
which we said web application are so the

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,900
question that comes in mind is that the

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,690
AYGO cells are great for running

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,270
stateless applications but where do we

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,730
get like the app databases that we need

00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,040
in order to bug the state for example

00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:07,070
that our application needs

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:11,300
and there is where the open service

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:13,790
broker API comes in developers can

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:17,770
provision and bind particular services

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:21,050
to an application so for example in our

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:23,750
talk here we spoke about databases if we

00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:26,840
need a databases we can get that through

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:31,430
the open service API and bind it to our

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,740
applications to see the other services

00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:36,710
that we can use a side of databases we

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,900
can do that by using the CF marketplace

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,270
command when you do that it will list

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,670
the various services that you can use

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:46,010
for your system one of it is databases

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:48,590
and then for example if you want to

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:52,670
create a database we use the CF create

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,200
service command to create the database

00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,110
and then we have to bind it to our

00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,960
application and we do that with the CF

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:03,950
bind service and once we do that any

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,890
time we push the application it will

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,110
create the processes that we need and it

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:13,040
also attached the services automatically

00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:15,170
if we have bound them previously to our

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:21,860
application through the steps that have

00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:24,980
explained before open service broker API

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:28,130
has had some new updates a few months

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,990
ago and now for example it improves a

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:33,260
synchronous operations and it does a lot

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:36,140
more other things I've added like a last

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,780
slide in this presentation that has

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,060
resources that you can see more of the

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,310
updates and also you can dive deeper

00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:49,010
into Cloud Foundry and the concepts

00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:52,250
around in it and with that said my talk

00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:57,230
is coming to an end I would like to

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:59,930
thank Swarna and Denise you this is my

00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:02,630
first talk at Cloud Foundry summit and

00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,750
they really helped me prepare with the

00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:08,980
presentation and gave me moral support

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:12,320
so I'd like to say a big thank you and

00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:35,910
can you speak a bit more loudly because

[Music]

00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:31,210
yes so yeah the business model would

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,340
explain later

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:49,240
anything related to this talk in

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:50,799
specific yeah you can yes so I study all

00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,529
of these things by myself as I said

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,210
after that interview I was still to

00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:56,409
learn about cloud computing so then I

00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,299
started digging and digging and digging

00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:58,809
and that's how I learned about Cloud

00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:01,630
Foundry

00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:05,250
and I did some like online courses

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:07,720
there's one at EDX about Cloud Foundry

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,000
for those of you who like to do courses

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,320
and there's like they have the

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,899
documentation and many other things

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,940
resources that you could use so that is

00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:17,950
how I learned about it so it's something

00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,049
you can learn by yourself but it's

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,480
always better if you can have someone to

00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:25,120
help you because then you don't have to

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,909
struggle as much but hopefully with this

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,470
talk it does the same thing it will help

00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:31,049
you not me to struggle that much with

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,049
