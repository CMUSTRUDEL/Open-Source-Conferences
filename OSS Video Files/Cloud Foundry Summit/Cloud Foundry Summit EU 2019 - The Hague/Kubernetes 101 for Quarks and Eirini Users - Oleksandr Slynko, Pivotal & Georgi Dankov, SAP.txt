	Kubernetes 101 for Quarks and Eirini Users - Oleksandr Slynko, Pivotal & Georgi Dankov, SAP 

For a long time, the majority of Cloud Foundry operators used Bosh to operate their deployments. Quarks project provides another way of deploying and using Cloud Foundry - Kubernetes. You might want to deploy it but don't know where to start.
 This talk is for you.
  Oleksandr and Georgi will show how to deploy and operate applications deployed on top of Kubernetes using Quarks. They will share their experience operating, upgrading and debugging Kubernetes-deployed Cloud Foundry. They will share potential caveats with starting with Quarks. Additionally, they will show the Eirini flow of deploying Cloud Foundry application. 
 As a result, you will be able to deploy on Kubernetes and use the simple Cloud Foundry installation."
