	CF Volume Services - Building for Failure, Security and Performance - Paul Warren, Dell EMC 

CloudFoundry has had a volume services capability for several years now allowing the platform to run workloads that require a persistent disk. We have also laid the groundwork for the same capabilities in Project Eirini and contributed to industry standards defining how to attach volumes into containers.  Based on NFS and SMB it has been both an interesting and challenging journey to provide a viable and reliable service offering into a modern, Cloud Native platform, using protocols that were designed decades ago and to a different set of assumptions.  Join Paul and Julian for a guided tour of Volume Services in CF and Project Eirini and on their journey from the very beginning finding a viable solution through to present day and building a service offering that is effective, efficient and resilient against failure.
