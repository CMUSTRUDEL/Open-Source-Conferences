great let's get started hello my name is

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,799
Johanna Ratliff I'm an engineer at

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,080
pivotal and this is the first podium of

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,639
all of the talks I begin it I give it at

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,630
this conference that I can actually see

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,180
over so I'm ecstatic

00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:23,210
this is leveraging CLI community plugins

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:27,390
so on the 101 talk I really wanted to

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,160
give y'all something that leveraged what

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,149
was already out there from the community

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:37,230
and what was already accessible to be

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,570
built in open-source as well so this

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,920
might be a similar experience to what

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,890
you've experienced with Cloud Foundry

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,780
CLI at any point you're going you feel

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,360
like you've figured out what exactly you

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,989
want to do to your app and then the CLI

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,149
is just not working for whatever you

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,710
needed so hopefully we'll be taking you

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:01,710
from this to something closer to this

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:04,860
and how are we gonna do that that is

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,860
going to be CLI plugins so the huge

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,880
benefit from CLI plugins is that you're

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,369
not trapped to what this standard CLI

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,860
binary looks like you can extend it for

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:21,990
yourself to be whatever you need so in

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,409
what scenario is what I want a CLI

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,330
plug-in well first when you're using any

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,850
kind of addendum product to Cloud

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,329
Foundry any kind of product that might

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,829
be new to the platform and you want to

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,280
leverage or you heard about a cool

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,680
feature here and maybe those features

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,340
aren't already in the standard CLI

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:50,159
release so examples of this might be log

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:52,890
cache or metric registrar which takes

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,869
some of your app metrics and puts them

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,610
back into the logging stream any kind of

00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:02,880
syslog drain functionality that you

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:07,680
might want from your service that you

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:11,069
stood up and sometimes the Cloud Foundry

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,660
plugins or the CLI plugins just give you

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,150
a nicer experience

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,580
your vanilla API so for example I'll

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:21,150
show you the log cache plug-in during

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,190
the demo but there are pieces of that

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,290
that if you're just querying or if

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,110
you're just hitting that API you're

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,690
gonna get a big dump of JSON and we can

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,760
actually make a much better experience

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,860
for you by taking those three or four

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,290
pieces that you're probably going to

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,820
want to scan first and formatting them

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,190
and so that's what we really leveraged

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,100
our CLI plugin for I'll show you that

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,170
later and then another time you might

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,480
want to CLI plug-in is when you think

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,520
well somebody else has definitely been

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,470
annoyed by lack of functionality on this

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,400
exact same thing and you're sitting

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,760
there and you're like I'm not the only

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,130
one I'm not the only one who needs this

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,720
that's a great time to look for a CLI

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:05,250
plug-in or perhaps write one yourself

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,790
which we'll get to so things like the

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,680
log cache plug-in we didn't go ahead and

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,110
continue with that same CF logs

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,180
experience we went and jumped into a

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,980
more UNIX experience so we said well we

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,740
have the power here so let's change it

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,140
from CF logs to CF tail and CF tail

00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,840
follow because a lot of folks will be

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:28,740
very familiar with that terminology and

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:32,790
we just make ease-of-use improve ease of

00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,640
use the Who am I plug-in one of my

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,320
colleagues wrote this and up until it's

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,060
been available for a long time and up

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:44,670
until eight months ago I would complain

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,310
and be like I just want a CF Who am I

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,630
why is it that hard why hasn't the CLI

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,310
team built this yet and they're like

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,040
there's a there's a plug-in Johanna

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,520
there's a plug-in so I went and I got it

00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,890
and I'm a much happier person now there

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,890
are so many plugins that have

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:07,430
[Music]

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:10,370
explanations on your repo plugins

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,280
commands that I'll show you that say hey

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,889
this is just so you can use a wild-card

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,070
in deploying your apps or deleting your

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:22,490
apps like I can do some a couple letters

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,229
star and those were like three apps that

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,220
I wanted to do the same thing to so

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:30,650
let's just throw a wild card in there

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,860
some of the explanations you'll see next

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:36,020
to the plug-in listings are like yeah

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,690
that is the thing I want that sounds

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:43,009
completely sane I'd absolutely want that

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:47,500
so anytime you feel like somebody else

00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:50,800
has definitely wanted this before okay

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,800
demo time

00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:09,409
okay we're gonna have to exit out of

00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:09,409
presentation mode really good

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,180
and what if we bump this up

00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:34,659
okay can you all see this to a

00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:36,339
relatively good extent okay so let's

00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:42,039
look at the plugins I have installed

00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:44,249
right now so you can see some of the

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,199
ones I was previously referencing and

00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:49,209
they give you the plug-in that you do

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,209
have installed they give you the version

00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:55,509
of the plug-in and some of these sub

00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:57,129
commands that you've been enabled on CLI

00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:59,199
do to this plug-in so what plugins

00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:04,329
really do is they give you a broader

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:06,699
suite of sub commands enabled so let's

00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:11,159
follow the instructions and just do repo

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:15,249
plugins as it tells us to and find out

00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:16,569
what plugins are available so a lot of

00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,829
these look really cool and they're

00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:19,449
coming from different community members

00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:24,279
so they're coming from the people at

00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:26,349
this conference things that like do all

00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:29,259
you know run the same command on all the

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,759
apps in a space org globally you've

00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,969
wanted to run the same command on that

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,339
before so let's make it easy to do it

00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:39,249
for every single one in a space route

00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:42,129
lookup find the applications associated

00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:45,819
with a given host name and you can see

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:48,639
how different levels of admin are like

00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:54,759
an admin level vs. developed developer

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:58,089
level off here we'll play into kind of

00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:03,129
leveraging these different plugins but

00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:05,259
for now let's give you an example of one

00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:10,419
of the ones one of the ones that my team

00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:16,529
wrote let's give you an example of how

00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:20,439
to add a plug-in to your CLI experience

00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:23,379
so I know somewhere up there is the bug

00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,809
noise plug-in and I'll show you where

00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:28,299
these are hosted in a little bit but

00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:32,289
this really is how easy it is to install

00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:35,099
a new plugin yes I do want that binary

00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:35,099
give it to me

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:43,770
so it goes out oh yeah this is speedy

00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:47,700
that's good so it goes out and fetches

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:50,910
from the Cloud Foundry community plugins

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,650
page where you can say hey community I

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,810
have a plug-in I would really like to

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,000
host it here and that is really what

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,280
repo plugins is fetching from what it

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,160
says here are all of your options and so

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,960
you can install a plug-in that you've

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,020
written for yourself it doesn't need to

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,300
be hosted on the community page you can

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,040
install a plug-in and say install it

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:16,490
from this local place I just wrote it

00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:19,380
for myself and try it out and you can

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,150
install a binary that you have on your

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,360
github you can say here's here's the

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:29,750
endpoint go install that binary don't

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:33,990
question me CLI and it will go and add

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:37,770
whatever addendum you've created this is

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:41,640
quite slow whatever you've created to

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:44,280
add it to your effectively sub commands

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:49,230
that you can leverage from just that CF

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,480
CLI experience so this is taking a while

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,290
so I'm gonna say that y'all have seen

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:59,790
how to install one and it's great and we

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:05,220
can just use some of the ones that are

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:08,460
already here so hopefully I'm still

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,860
logged in but for example if I wanted to

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,130
use my log cache plugin

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:20,690
I could be hitting an API and get a

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:20,690
really extensive JSON drop but instead

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,600
I can get some of that condensed

00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:36,699
information the things I really care

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,430
about cache duration the number of

00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:43,319
things stored in my log cache for the

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:47,110
apps in my space where I am right here

00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:49,089
so as this user I only have my log

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,850
spinner demo app but you can see how

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:57,850
this can be a lot nicer of an experience

00:09:51,850 --> 00:10:00,129
than just full JSON and only being able

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,410
to hit the API so if that's ever

00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:03,819
something that you've written an app

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,709
that you're like you know what I would

00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:07,629
love to be able to condense some of this

00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:09,939
information for my own uses you can also

00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:12,779
write a plug-in and just improve your

00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:12,779
experience like that

00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:26,559
additionally let's try

00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:29,079
çf tale log spinner demo look so many

00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,490
metrics what a delightful experience but

00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:33,670
this is what I was telling you about

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,679
kind of tail vs. tail follow we decided

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,480
that a unix-like experience was a

00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,809
priority for us so we wrote some

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:45,490
commands that our tail tail follow that

00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:51,490
are normal for the way we think about a

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:55,959
CLI usage so that's kind of a quick demo

00:10:51,490 --> 00:11:01,509
intro to how you can start navigating

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:06,309
CLI plug-ins where that information

00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:16,749
might be and then what we're gonna do is

00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:22,110
pop back to some slides and pull up a

00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:26,860
couple pages so I really wish plug in X

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:29,579
existed well plug in discovery can be

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,579
done at that

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:37,000
repo plugins command directly in your

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,710
CLI like we showed but it can also be

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:49,070
sorry all the Wi-Fi is real slow right

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:50,510
now but it can also be on this page that

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,930
I will show you when it comes up in a

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,930
second

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,440
go little Paige go okay

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:20,700
I'll pull it over later okay so this is

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,339
the Cloud Foundry community CLI plugins

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,459
page so this is where you would want to

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,140
engage and you can see to include your

00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:30,120
plug-in in our community repo please

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,970
follow the instructions on github so you

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,740
can go to their github page through here

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,329
and say hey I'd really like to

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,740
contribute a plug-in back in maybe

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:43,220
you've written one maybe you're excited

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:45,630
to share it with community and have it

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,970
shown directly on here so that that

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:52,100
binary can be pulled down from anybody

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,100
saying hey I'd like this plug-in

00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:58,200
additionally like I said you can do

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,329
plug-in installs from your own local if

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,220
you've written one but I really

00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:03,959
encourage anybody who's interested in

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,579
developing plugins to contribute them

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,890
back to the community because so often

00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:13,380
there's that oh I would totally use that

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:14,640
experience speaking up should totally

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,019
show y'all later The Who am I

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,649
experienced I was I was previously

00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:22,500
referencing so these are just a couple

00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:29,959
of the CLI plugins that you probably saw

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:33,480
in that repo plugins output earlier so

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:37,010
there-there is definitely this big scary

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:44,160
warning of like it is it is a binary

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:45,899
that to an extent we've we've hoped will

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,990
not have malicious actors adding things

00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:51,480
to the community plugins but yeah I

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,550
would perhaps if you're interested in a

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,860
plug-in and you don't know who wrote it

00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:00,180
maybe go check out the github and make

00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,890
sure it's not malicious but so they're

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,440
not vetted but they are a really

00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:07,199
powerful tool that most most of us have

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,579
successfully used without too much

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:13,560
trauma there so these are pretty good

00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:18,870
instructions for kind of using your

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:21,149
first plug-in command and as previously

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,850
mentioned really what plugins do do is

00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,390
they expand your grouping of sub

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:31,980
commands

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:34,500
you can use for the CFC Li and you can

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:39,410
even host it on cf community right from

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,410
the CLI you can do CF ad plug-in repo

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:48,300
and you can also list the plug-in repos

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,310
if I think you can add a different

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,580
plug-in repo to say like here's our

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:59,820
internal plug-in repo that we as a

00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:09,600
company host our plugins on but that

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:13,260
might okay so going to developing CF CLI

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,240
plugins this is a lot simpler than you

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,040
might give it credit for because you do

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,050
have this really nice interface of just

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,050
like I'll pull up

00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:59,850
probably already have this loaded let's

00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:06,480
go look at the Who am I plug-in that I

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:09,840
previously mentioned cool so this is the

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,860
main go that Johannes wrote for The Who

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:21,930
am I plug-in as you can see this main is

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:24,210
not huge but this is this is literally

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:30,690
how you extend and create a plugin you

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:32,610
say plug-in usage and you explain what

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:38,640
the command is going to look like

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:43,920
you give it help text and then engaging

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,750
with the CL is already known information

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,240
is really easy too because you just say

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,890
like hey I have a CLI connection get me

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,250
the current org data I get me the

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,170
current space data so the CLI itself is

00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,030
already taking care of all of that user

00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,980
off and things like that

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:03,750
communicating with UA and Kathy about

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:06,540
all the specifics there and then you get

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,699
to just leverage this add-on power of

00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,620
saying like hey can I have a CLI

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,990
connection great give me the information

00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:15,750
that you need and then you can sort it

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:20,069
in however way that you need it for the

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:27,920
purpose of your for the purpose of your

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:27,920
add-on or your plugin so any questions

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:39,450
questions about plugins questions about

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,870
writing plugins

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,870
sure

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,080
okay

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,500
yeah a lot of that becomes engagement

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:12,120
with the CLI core team because certain

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,860
plugins like they don't get just

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,260
automatically adopted into the into the

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,799
course he'll I but it is definitely

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:23,350
something that if you have kind of proof

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,149
that a lot of people are using it and

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,059
you can engage with the core team about

00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:31,419
like hey I would really like this

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:34,899
functionality in course EF there are

00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:37,210
definitely security arguments and such

00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:39,520
to be made to that team if you're saying

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,740
here look at this big user base so I

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,549
think it's on a case-by-case basis I've

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:47,799
only I've only engaged with them about

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:51,130
the log cache plug-in about the

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,320
potential for that but yeah I would say

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,409
it's on a case by case basis but again

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,059
they they're pretty open to like look at

00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:03,190
this proof that people use it don't you

00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:05,610
want it in your core thing any other

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,610
questions

00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,179
yeah

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:24,810
yeah yeah so I've only ever used go but

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,970
I mean effectively it's a binary right

00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:40,310
so as long as you can produce a binary

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:42,180
Josh go honey has written a couple noted

00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:45,240
learned something new today

00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,280
um I assumed that was just my language

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,410
preferences but it's apparent that it's

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,100
it's everybody's um

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:55,460
but go is a delightful thing to you so I

00:19:53,100 --> 00:20:01,580
would encourage you to do that anyway

00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:04,620
all right any other questions all right

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:07,370
thanks folks for coming to this slightly

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,370
