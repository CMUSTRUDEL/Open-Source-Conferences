[Music]

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:35,989
I think the thing I like most about the

00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,149
Cloud Foundry community is just to focus

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:40,970
on the people that are involved it's an

00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:43,010
easy community to get involved in it's a

00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,930
very welcoming and open community and we

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,770
address issues that go far beyond just

00:00:44,930 --> 00:01:01,810
the technology

00:00:45,770 --> 00:01:05,069
[Music]

00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,069
[Applause]

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,910
there's so many different talks so many

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,890
different types of topics you can't

00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,040
really choose every talk so you want to

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,040
go

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,690
I think the favorite thing about being

00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,300
involved in the cloud parent community

00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,220
stepping people values of those people

00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,330
as well it's a very welcoming inclusive

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,750
community

00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,830
[Applause]

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:35,000
[Music]

00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,000
[Applause]

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,460

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,290
