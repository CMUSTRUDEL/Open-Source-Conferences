Description: 
	How Did Our Garden Grow? Advances in the Cloud Foundry App Runtime's Container Engine - Yulia Nedyalkova, SAP & Giuseppe Capizzi, Pivotal 

Garden (the Cloud Foundry App Runtime’s container engine, optimised for PaaS workloads) saw awesome features bloom over the last year. This talk will help operators understand and leverage new security features such as rootless, and will introduce developers to the new and long-requested CPU Entitlements feature. It will also give a sneak peek into Garden’s latest track of work - productising CF’s multi-tenancy security defaults for K8S users.  Garden is the first production runtime to support rootless mode; a wonderful security benefit. Leveraging containerd, Garden now uses more industry standards than ever, allowing for a much more familiar operator experience. New container CPU metrics enable operators and tooling to make better decisions about scaling. The next step will be to expose our cool features and defaults to K8S so we can all take advantage of them.
