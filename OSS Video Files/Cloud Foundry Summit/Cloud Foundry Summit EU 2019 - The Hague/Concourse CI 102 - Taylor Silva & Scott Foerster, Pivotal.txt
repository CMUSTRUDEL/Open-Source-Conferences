Concourse CI is a general-purpose workflow automation tool. This talk, a “102” level, is for Concourse users who want to understand more about the inner workings of Concourse. Taylor and Scott will provide an overview of how Concourse components work under the hood, from the worker scheduling logic, to volume and container management on each worker, and what metrics are emitted from Concourse. They will close out with a brief overview of what improvements the Concourse core team is currently working on.
