	Intro to Development of Java Spring Microservices with Cloud Foundry - Jan Svoboda, Pivotal 

This session will introduce basic principles how to develop microservices with Java Spring Boot and Cloud Foundry. It's targeted for developers who are interested in learning new cloud native development practices and understand how could the new technology stack improve their current work. 
  At the beginning I will explain which technologies I have selected for developing microservices and what are their benefits. Then I will introduce simple demo application which will allow us to demonstrate microservice development principles such as application debugging and monitoring, application deployment, communication to other microservices, or database connections. 
  Demo application code will be available to all participants. So everyone would be able to test the introduced patterns in their development environments and fully understand the cloud native development with Java Spring Boot."
