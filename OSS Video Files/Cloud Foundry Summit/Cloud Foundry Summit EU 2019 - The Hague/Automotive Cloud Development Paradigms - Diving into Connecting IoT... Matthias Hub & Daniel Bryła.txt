	Automotive Cloud Development Paradigms - Diving into Connecting IoT, CloudFoundry, Kubernetes and Porsche - Matthias Hub, Porsche & Daniel Bryła, Grape Up 

Latest trends make connecting vehicles with the cloud a necessity to attract customers. The difficulty comes not only from rising customer expectations but also from technological complexity. Handling connection losses, inactive cars, and a huge amount of data are standard fares in this business. To reduce complexity and boost development process, Porsche decided to explore an IoT platform approach. During this talk, Matthias and Daniel will show how Porsche and Grape Up are building an automotive IoT platform on top of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. They will focus on developer experience of this R&D project and will show how infrastructure abstraction helps in rapidly changing environment. Moreover, the speech will cover multiple architecture patterns (e.g. digital twin) which combined with the CF ecosystem helps to deal with a massive load, keeps the system clean and open for extensions
