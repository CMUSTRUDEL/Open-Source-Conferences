This presentation is intended for users who would like to get their first hands-on experience or for others who might want to evaluate an alternative deployment option. The analysis will compare the public offerings based on the metrics of price, availability, options and available services as well as the self-deployed options in terms of simplicity in setup and handling and requirements. It is supposed to cover the breadth of the Cloud Foundry offerings and give an easy entry path to the technology. Kubernetes-based offerings like CFCR, containerized CF & Project Eirini will be covered as well.
