	Baby Got Back Ups: How to Leverage your CF Blobstore Provider to Improve your Backup Experience - Sarah Connor & Emmanouil Kiagias, Pivotal Cloud Foundry 

Regardless of how sturdy a platform is setup, disasters are inevitable and a platform will need to be restored. Usually, backups can be a headache to maintain, can take ages to complete and can start to eat away at storage costs. Often times the decision is made to reduce the frequency or even stop taking backups at all!  The BOSH Backup and Restore cli can be used to backup and restore a CF foundation and provides a solid experience if configured properly.  This talk will cover how the setup of your platform impacts the size, speed and lifecycle management of your BBR backups. Different storage providers such as GCS, AWS S3, S3 compatible and WebDAV affect how the BBR cli backs up your CF deployment blobstore leading to a significant difference in the backup experience. Having a better understanding of these differences allows you make an informed decision about your backup strategy.
