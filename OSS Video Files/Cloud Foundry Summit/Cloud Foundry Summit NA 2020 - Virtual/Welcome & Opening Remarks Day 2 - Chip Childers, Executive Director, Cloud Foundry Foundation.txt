hi welcome to day two of the cf summit

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,799
virtual experience

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,000
thank you all for welcoming us into your

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,280
homes

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,920
and joining us from around the world

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,679
today is all about contributors getting

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,960
started as a contributor

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,800
learning about the leading edge ideas

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,560
that our projects are exploring

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,720
finding ways to help each other in a

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,640
cross-project collaboration

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,720
and really getting to know each other

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,480
when i took the role of executive

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,880
director i really talked about two

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,360
priorities

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,120
first was to help all of you on the

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,559
journey to bring cloud foundry closer

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,719
together with kubernetes

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,160
and istio and all the other projects

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,039
that you're embracing

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,120
um in in our architecture the second was

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,920
to focus on supporting the community

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,320
itself the individuals that pour so much

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,760
time

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,199
energy and heart into the projects

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,719
with that in mind i've been thinking

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,480
about the progress that has been made

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,039
over the last several months

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,800
it's been extraordinary the ancient

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,159
greek philosopher

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,439
heracles said change is the only

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,119
constant in life

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,880
and that's something that we embody in

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,080
the spirit of our project the spirit of

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,760
our community

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,920
we understand that we've evolved

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,880
continually at least since i've been

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,479
involved since starting in 2015.

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,640
early on our community created its own

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,520
container orchestration components

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,920
in fact we did two versions of a

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,000
container orchestration component

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,840
because we were ahead of the time in

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
using containers and we had to build

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,759
something

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,880
that served the purpose of delivering a

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,320
reliable multi-tenant application

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,560
platform

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,159
but today kubernetes has matured it's a

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,640
general purpose platform

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,159
and our community is embracing it

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,360
exploring how the architecture can

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,159
fundamentally change

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,600
in the new infrastructure environment

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,159
finding ways to embrace

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,479
other cloud native open source projects

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,119
as components in our system

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,280
but also remaining focused on developer

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,119
experience

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
now ultimately the our community of

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,440
contributors committers project leads

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,039
after we make this transition we're

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,080
going to be in an even better position

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,080
to focus on that developer experience

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
we need that focus as new capabilities

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,280
become possible through our

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,120
architectural changes

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,920
and i challenge each of you to think

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,520
carefully about how we craft the right

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,280
experience for developers having empathy

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,239
for the amount of cognitive load we put

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,239
on them

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,480
as a new capability rolls out are we

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,800
making it as simple as possible

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,400
are we exposing the right amount of

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,040
configurability

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,879
are we exposing the right capabilities

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,599
of the underlying components

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,200
and are we fitting into the future

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,879
information architectures

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,160
of the organizations that rely on the

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,959
cloud foundry platform for the

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,720
development teams

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,040
it's absolutely a renewed time of energy

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,400
in the community with new ideas

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,319
a lot of new people and a clear vision

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,879
and so i encourage all of you to

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,360
continue to embrace change as a constant

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,720
continue to be welcoming and inclusive

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,599
and keep building

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,599
towards our future

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
now today is all about community and

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,519
contributors

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,280
and so we have two community awards that

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,560
we want to

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,239

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,959
community always talking about

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,799
how cloud foundry can be powerful in an

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,200
organization always talking about how

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,239

may be very well known in the community

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,080
or may be

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,439
quiet but doing amazing work in the

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,880
background

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,799
but what they do is they demonstrate a

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,239
commitment to the project a commitment

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,320

the winner today is leading one of the

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,000
most important

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,840
efforts for our ecosystem the release

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,040
integration team

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,280
significantly increasing the

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,120
transparency for the release process

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,120
especially in areas where early warnings

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,600
to end users and distributions

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,720
are important breaking changes new

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,919
features

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,639
things like that more recently uh

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,120
this recipient has been at the forefront

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,320
of

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,000
the cf for kubernetes project

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,360
they've demonstrated an exceptional

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,120
exceptionally strong desire for

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,199
cross-team collaboration

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
both throughout the application runtime

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,880
pmc

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,320
and specifically with the kubecf project

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,320
which has very common goals and

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,000
lots of similar aims to the cf for

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,320
kate's project

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,280
so i want to congratulate sayuram from

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,120
vmware

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,520
for winning the committed contributor

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,520
award

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,160
i also want to take a minute to thank

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,440
our sponsors again we cannot run events

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,360
virtual or in person without sponsorship

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,560
our diamond sponsors are sousa and

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,639
vmware tanzu

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,759
our platinum sponsor is ibm cloud our

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,960
gold sponsors are

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,720
any nines and sap and

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,919
i ask all of you to take a minute to go

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,840
visit the sponsors in the exhibitor area

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,680
chat with them schedule a meeting watch

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,960
their demos find out what they have to

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,120
offer

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,479
even if you work for another vendor it's

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,520
worth understanding

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,000
how amazing our ecosystem is you can

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,240
also

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,759
use the networking and attendee chats

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,600
within the platform

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,280
join conversations in the networking

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
area or you can have one-on-one

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,440
text or video calls with other attendees

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
think of that like the virtual hallway

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,560
track

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,919
it might not be as easy as walking down

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,360
a hallway and actually seeing someone

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,080
that you want to have a brief

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,800
conversation with

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,400
but it's a great chance to collaborate

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,639
now the more you interact with

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,840
sponsors the more you interact during

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,639
the sessions

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,759
the more questions you ask when you fill

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,840
out our survey

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,360
you're earning points we want to have a

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,280
little fun with this

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,960
so the more interaction that you do over

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,280
the course of today

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,639
the higher your points are and the top

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,160
10 point earners are going to win some

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,319
pretty cool prizes you can go check

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
those out

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,160
i also of course want to remind everyone

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,840
about the code of conduct because

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,919
being inclusive is at the heart of the

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,520
cloud foundry community spirit

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,440
and it's incredibly important that each

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,000
one of you remains

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,800
true to the code of conduct i abide by

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,759
it

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,000
and if you find that someone is not

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,680
please let us know

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,520
if you have any questions or need any

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,520
type of support reach out to our event

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,520
staff using the event staff tab in the

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,319
menu

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,840
we're all there to help you find

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,199
information

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,479
we can point you in the right direction

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,880
if you're having technical challenges

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,440
with the site

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,199
and so with that i want to thank all of

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,919
you again for joining us

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,880
for this virtual event it means to the

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,800
world to us

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,240
we we hope to get as much feedback as

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,759
possible about how this

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,639
goes as a reminder we will be taking the
