Cloud Foundry for Kubernetes seeks to bring the simple, self-service APIs of Cloud Foundry to the powerful, but complicated world of Kubernetes. By bringing the “cf map-route” experience to Kubernetes, developers can focus on core application business logic instead of complex Kubernetes networking configuration.

In this session, Tim and Nitya will cover the design decisions, implementation, and extensibility of the new networking tier in CF for Kubernetes. They will demonstrate how CF for Kubernetes leverages Istio service mesh and Kubernetes networking features to enhance the platform. They will also present a new Kubernetes custom resource and controller: the CF Route CRD and RouteController. The CF Route CRD and RouteController lend future extensibility to the networking tier by opening up potential for additional control planes and pluggable ingress implementations in the future.
