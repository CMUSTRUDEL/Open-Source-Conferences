	Why Empathy Matters in Infrastructure Technology - Craig McLuckie, VMware 

For more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/ 

The industry has standardized around Kubernetes as its leading orchestration platform. But due to its complexity – and a lack of experience and expertise – Kubernetes remains a challenge to deploy and manage.

Faced with an increasing amount of pressure to create innovative software that delivers competitive business advantages and beneficial user experiences, developers hold a crucial role in the development cycle. Thus, it's the developer experience that must be at the forefront. Empathy must be top of mind for the individuals behind the delivery of orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

Craig McLuckie, Vice President of R&D at VMware, will discuss the importance of the developer experience, the role empathy can play for the broader developer ecosystem, and how his team is ensuring the VMware Tanzu portfolio extends beyond IT infrastructure.

hi folks and welcome to the Cloud

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,170
Foundry foundation virtual summit

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,420
my name is Craig McClatchy and I'm

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,099
excited to have a few minutes to chat to

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,690
you about a topic that I'm very

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,849
passionate about which is really the

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,800
intersection of the world of developer

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,250
technologies and infrastructure

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,320
technologies before I jump in I did want

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,600
to say I hope that you and your loved

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,840
ones are safe and well in this most

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,609
trying of times obviously as a community

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,160
over we're working through an incredibly

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,790
disruptive moment both at the societal

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,399
level but also at the industry level I'm

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,710
personally not qualified to comment on

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,329
the challenges we face society but I do

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,739
stand in solidarity with those

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,989
struggling for racial equality and

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,940
justice in the world and you know

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,410
personally in support of businesses

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,960
large and small that are working to

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,239
adjust to the new reality that is

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,390
emerging as a result of the unprecedent

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,789
global pandemic we all face it is almost

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,109
impossible to predict what the world is

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,989
going to look like in the coming years

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,930
but one thing is clear the world is

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,570
changing businesses are changing society

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,299
is changing in some profound ways when

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,540
we look back historically technology has

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,580
been a catalyst for change itself a new

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,350
technology emerges it creates new

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,030
efficiencies for business it creates new

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,479
ways that businesses can create value

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,460
for customers and in many ways

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:29,700
technology disruption has fueled

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,369
innovation in a great many ecosystems

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,950
looking back through history from the

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,290
industrial era but this does feel a

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,290
little bit different change is being

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,240
inflicted on us enterprise organizations

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,159
are being forced by changes that are

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,159
happening to engage their customers in

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,829
new ways the rate of change is being is

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,060
propelling us at an unprecedented level

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:56,790
and when I think about what is going to

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,530
ultimately differentiate organizations

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,869
that are able to navigate the changes

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,369
that we face right now as businesses are

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,130
having to operate in profoundly

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,740
different ways I keep coming back to the

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,310
developer as being a catalyst for future

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,110
success how effectively enterprises can

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,420
bring developers capabilities to

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,610
there to drive the changes that they

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,890
need to support their customers in this

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,050
increasingly complex and evolving

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,510
ecosystem will fundamentally define

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,690
their ability to continue to compete and

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,820
prosper in this changing ecosystem and

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,460
from my perspective I've obviously been

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,470
involved in this technology for some

00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,770
time as one of the founders of the

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,120
kubernetes project I participated in

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,760
bringing a new infrastructure

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,280
abstraction to market increasingly my

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,290
work in VMware as we work to bring the

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,760
pivotal and VMware teams together is

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,840
giving me an opportunity to the world

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,850
look at the world through a new lens

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,830
which i think is incredibly powerful and

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,830
entirely relevant to this community and

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,750
at the starting point as a starting

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,390
point for this discussion I'd really

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,300
like to focus on what I perceived to be

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,250
some of the emerging tensions that exist

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,810
in enterprises at large and this is a

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,239
tension that is borne out over the last

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,620
many years and if anything is being

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,780
accelerated by the world that we're

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,370
moving into which is the tension between

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,380
the teams that are charted with

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,810
delivering infrastructure outcomes for

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,880
organizations the teams that are charted

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,250
with constructing platforms for general

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,690
development consumption and then the

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,280
development teams themselves that

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,230
represent the interests of line of

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,360
business those organizations that are

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,820
ultimately charted with capturing

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,080
business problems and solving them with

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,489
code whether that's code that they're

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,890
writing themselves with as code that's

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,299
being integrated from search parties and

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,610
we do see this tremendous tension

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,400
emerging line of businesses of being

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,459
driven to operate at an unprecedented

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,110
pace this was true before a lot of the

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,450
challenges we've been dealing with with

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,480
tech note incidents like Ovid took over

00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:01,140
but if anything that meat is accelerated

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,700
and to serve those customers better the

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,940
infrastructure and platform teams are

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,230
left scrambling and always say this

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:11,250
agile teams need agile infrastructure

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:15,180
and as we see those tensions started to

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,970
pull apart there's an absolute need to

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,500
bring technologies like cloud foundry

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,750
into the mix because I think it

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,190
elegantly spans those gaps and by

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,440
harmonizing technologies like cloud

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,850
foundry with the emerging infrastructure

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
abstractions like cumin

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,870
I think we'll create disproportionately

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,110
positive outcomes for organizations

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,940
large and small now looking a little

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,980
deeper into what's happening out there

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,350
now one of the things that always

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,870
fascinates me as I work with line of

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,140
business teams is the separation of

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,330
effort how much of their time is spent

00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,160
engineering that is dealing with the

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,740
Yukie mechanics of getting code into a

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,750
production environment versus developing

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,790
that is actually solving business

00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,240
problems with code capturing business

00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,640
logic in code and today for most

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,140
organizations there's this

00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,080
disproportionate amount of emphasis on

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,750
engineering often 80% of time that is

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,880
taken on a daily basis by by large teams

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,070
is spent worrying about the mechanics of

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,620
setting up their environments of dealing

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,310
with DevOps practices of reasoning about

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,450
debugging a lot of instances out there

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,990
versus actually driving the innovation

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,340
that organizations need and our mission

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,290
you know is that hopefully there's a

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,530
community but certainly as I look at my

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,410
items participation in this ecosystem is

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,480
to really skew the emphasis towards

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,990
developing construct the set of

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,550
experiences that enable enterprises to

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,790
get their code to production in the most

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,170
efficient way possible now you know as I

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,730
mentioned earlier I've been working on

00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,970
technologies like kubernetes

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:53,370
as being a an important part that is a

00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,920
staple and I think kubernetes is doing a

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,350
great job of normalizing infrastructure

00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,750
I think the reason that it achieved such

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,360
high levels of popularity was because

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,610
finally we had the promise of a

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,200
technology that would make every cloud

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,730
environment every on-premises

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,890
environments and potentially every edge

00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,480
environment look and feel consistent

00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,880
that increased high levels of

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,290
fungibility it provided consists of

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,170
operating semantics for those

00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:21,030
environments and for that reason we've

00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,290
seen pretty much every major enterprise

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,880
out there start to embrace the

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:27,870
technology and look at it as a common

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,490
staple in their new ecosystem but the

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,030
thing that I see happening out there

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,020
almost on a daily basis is the

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,340
question/answer you know the challenge

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,770
to answer the question well what happens

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,090
next and too often I see organizations

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,699
get extremely excited about

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,380
oh geez our kubernetes put an inordinate

00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,720
amount of emphasis and effort into

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,250
getting an operationally viable robust

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,530
deployment of a technology like

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,600
kubernetes deployed but then finding

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,490
themselves unable to actually deal with

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,810
what happens next how do we give

00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,030
production workloads into that

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,699
environment how do we set it up in a way

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,479
that our developers are not spending an

00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,220
inordinate amount of their time

00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,710
constructing their own delivering

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,780
mechanics to get applications out into

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,729
that wall and that is where I see the

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,880
power of the cloud foundry technology

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:15,490
base it's absolutely fascinating to see

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,650
how conversations have changed the

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,570
conversations I have when I was purely

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,250
representing the world of Canaries were

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,720
certainly interesting there was more

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,060
about bits and bytes and speeds and

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,520
feeds and operationalization and sre and

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,380
that type of problem but increasingly

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,610
the type of conversation that I have

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,780
with organizations that have been

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,229
consuming technologies like cloud

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,910
foundry is really about that developer

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:39,190
experience the productivity the thing

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,410
that really matters to organisations and

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,960
I think the amazing opportunity we have

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,090
as a community is to really bring these

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,460
two walls together to look at

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,070
technologies like kubernetes as a way to

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,380
normalize the playing field to reduce

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,210
the complexity of deploying a very broad

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,220
cross-section of workloads into an

00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,590
infrastructure environment and their

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,820
technologies like cloud foundry emerging

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,310
as a way to really light up those

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,710
environments to solve the problems that

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,440
every developer has every day how do i

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,680
altom utley get my application into a

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,900
production environment and so when I

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,880
think about cloud foundry I always like

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,820
to describe the CF bush experience as

00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,340
this highway from a developer's IDE into

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,160
production environment and it's amazing

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,490
how by introducing a set of normalized

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,470
constraints by saying if something fits

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,469
within this 12 factor form is this 12

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,669
factor format if you use these these

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:35,800
libraries that are being delivered

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,339
whether that's in the spring will donate

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,440
or pick the language runtime supported

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,419
you get an incredibly positive outcome

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,589
the developers no longer have to worry

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,490
so much about the mechanics of

00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:50,889
engineering they just spend their time

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,989
coding and that in a looot development

00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:56,559
development becomes a lot easier to deal

00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:57,879
with now how do we bring that into the

00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,109
world of communities and this is one of

00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,839
the things that I've been so excited to

00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:03,850
see is the focus on bringing kubernetes

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,579
as a natural orchestration technology to

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,619
cloud foundry and ultimately bringing

00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:12,730
the superhighway experience to be able

00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:14,649
to go from a developer's desktop into

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,470
that production context in as efficient

00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:21,579
of way possible

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:25,689
now I do think that the highway analogy

00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:27,850
is a little bit simplistic when I think

00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:29,679
about the places that Cloud Foundry has

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,559
been tremendously successful it's

00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,660
relatively constrained to a certain set

00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,679
of patterns and practices but when I

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:40,359
think about the wide world of developer

00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,209
applications there's obviously the need

00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:45,759
to start thinking about a much richer

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,489
and broader set of patterns and

00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,220
practices how do we start to think about

00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:53,319
one leveraging out the existing assets

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,299
that enterprises have and bringing them

00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:57,639
onto this Highway and perhaps you're

00:09:55,299 --> 00:10:01,179
already building something using Jenkins

00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,439
is there a way to use the processes that

00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:05,559
you have from a Keynesian aggression

00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:07,329
perspective to deliver into this

00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,739
environment so you can have systematize

00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:13,089
CG you can bring all these things

00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:14,410
together and so as I look at where we

00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:16,389
can have an opportunity to go and

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,999
certainly as I look at the direction

00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:21,459
that my team is is pushing to to bring

00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:23,589
Cloud Foundry forwards we do see this

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:25,569
prevalent pragmatism looking at the wall

00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,669
not necessary as a superhighway but as

00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:29,589
having a set of natural interchanges

00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,720
more like a subway map where you can

00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,160
continue that very efficient direct path

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,079
to production but you have the

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,119
opportunities to look more broadly and

00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:39,669
bring in a much wider array of workloads

00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:41,769
into a consistent operating model onto a

00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:43,720
consistent infrastructure base and out

00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,129
to consistent environments that your

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,699
developers no longer have to really

00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:51,100
worry about and so I think the promise

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:53,829
of the future for Cloud Foundry in

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,039
particular is really cut around three

00:10:53,829 --> 00:11:00,610
things I spent a lot of time talking to

00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,739
the team about what it takes to genera

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,820
size the experience to start to think

00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:06,820
about what we can

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,410
- from the Cloud Foundry perspective to

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,440
offer up capabilities to a much wider

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:15,130
array of workloads polyglot environments

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,890
new classes of workloads like EMA Linnea

00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,970
etc are incredibly interesting and for

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,160
us to be able to do that

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,160
I believe that modularization is a very

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,020
logical next step to make the technology

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,540
as applicable to as broad array of

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,550
workloads as possible it makes sense to

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,110
start teasing apart some of the

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,590
capabilities and if I look at the work

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,600
that's been done around KPAC and

00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:41,020
bringing that Cloud Foundry build pack

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,020
model to a community and not to a lot of

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,540
technologies in a much more discreet

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,670
composable way is incredibly powerful

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,300
and also think about the world of

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:54,370
democratization how do we make it so

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,800
that this technology that historically

00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,140
has been quite intricate and complicated

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,470
from an Operations perspective is simply

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:05,200
a lot easier to deploy operate and

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,760
consume how do we make it so that every

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,320
kubernetes cluster out there in this

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,170
increasingly large number of them

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,270
becomes a natural destination for

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:16,180
workloads that can be built using the

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,070
Cloud Foundry ideals and this mission of

00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,480
generis ization marginalization

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,790
ultimately democratization of the

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,140
technologies well I think service well

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:28,750
it allows us to bring a very sharp focus

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,400
to the needs of day-to-day developers as

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,250
they reasoning about this incredibly

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,670
complex world and it creates an amazing

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:39,400
opportunity for us to take a positive

00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:42,160
step forwards and bring together two of

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,650
the most robust and healthy open-source

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,360
communities out there so with that I

00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,820
wanted to thank you for your time I

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,100
really appreciate it again please stay

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,960
safe and sane during this incredibly

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,820
trying time and I'm so looking forward

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,130
to working with this community in the

00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,130
