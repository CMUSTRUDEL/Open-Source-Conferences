Description: 
	Stratos Project Update: What's Next? - Neil MacDougall, SUSE 

For more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/ 

In this talk, I will review the progress made on the Stratos project since the last summit and demonstrate some of the newer features we've added recently. For those not familiar with Stratos, the demo will also provide an introductory overview of Stratos and its capabilities. I'll end the session by looking forward, talking about what's next for the project, including adding support for the V3 API and improving the extension mechanism. If you don't know what Stratos is, want to hear what the team has been up to and where they are going, this is the talk for you.

this is talk stratas project update

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,099
what's next my name is Neil mcdougal I'm

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,940
a technical engineering manager at Sousa

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,500
and I lead the Stratos project in this

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,510
session I'm going to talk a bit about

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,140
Stratos very quickly kind of what we've

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,449
been doing over the last few months and

00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:28,439
then I will be looking forward mainly to

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,250
what's coming next with Stratos so how

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,989
did we get here

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,690
real brief back in 2017 suza open

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,300
sourced Stratos would be active

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,899
developing but we then showed it in the

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,450
summit in Europe that year we proposed

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,690
at the end of the year that we incubate

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,059
Stratos as part of the cloud foundry

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,399
extensions PMC that was accepted in the

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,399
following year and roll on a little bit

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,230
forward and in September of last year we

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,520
finally graduated that incubation and

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:05,790
became a core project and with that the

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,970
renamed so you will now find as get comm

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,680
Cloud Foundry slash practice Stratos

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,080
continues to be an active project so

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,180
this was an analysis we became across in

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,729
the last year than by some other company

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,689
and structures came out as a very active

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:25,080
projects which was nice to see in terms

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,520
of recent releases we over the last I

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,460
guess few months these are the the

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,530
releases we've we've pushed out and some

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,869
of the things we've done which I'll show

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,820
real briefly in a minute in a short demo

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,439
things like being able to backup your

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,310
inputs and tokens if you're using

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,290
multiple boundaries general improvements

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,960
are things like application to port UI

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,540
things that maybe you don't see but

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,430
behind the scenes in previous

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,070
scalability so if you have a cloud

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,680
foundry that has a large number of

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,270
August and spaces or Apps users we've

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,119
tried to optimize things as much as

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,820
possible so that you get a much more

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,670
kind of responsive UI your knots that

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,129
waiting for too long and we try and be

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,660
smart as we can making sure that it

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,690
works well for the case that you have a

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:16,400
small system as well as

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,660
has large numbers of apps or orcs we

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
added things like being able to deploy

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,260
applications via midge there's a dark

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,330
mode to the support for VCF events and

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,130
things like your scaling UI which was a

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,890
contribution from our colleagues at IBM

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,630
we continue to refine that and update

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,090
that what I'll do now I'll give you a

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,650
quick demo of Stratus I'll focus on some

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,990
of those just so you get a taste with

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,920
some of the things I've gone in there

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,250
and then we'll come back and talk about

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,500
what's next you know one of the things

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,320
we we've added we've improved just a

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,700
nice thing if you know if you've got

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,870
your email address set you can now

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:57,410
change the avatar icon to your Gravatar

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,030
that's why nice you can also choose dark

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,340
themes that we've had abducting support

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,090
you can either explicitly switch up with

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:09,140
a dark thing or you can pick up your OS

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:12,800
setting so that's quite nice to small

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:15,020
things in terms of applications you can

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,140
now pull an application from my

00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:22,400
doctorate Mitch so this and actually go

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:26,420
through as the for book always vary and

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,530
you can give that face name and select

00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:39,860
lock on it so you could for example good

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:43,790
boy Santos and this works the same way

00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:48,950
as pushing an application from taking

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:50,390
that repo other things we've done if I

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,709
look at an application without some

00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,410
extra information down here so you now

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,060
easily get the application quit you can

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,950
see all sensitive health check you guys

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:06,830
all that so little things like that

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:08,540
quite nice if you use Stratos for

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,250
multiple endpoints so I know lot of

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,630
people don't they they have Stratos

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,209
configured against a single cloud

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,910
factory but of course we let you connect

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,500
in multiple code factories and if you

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,859
find yourself building up quite a set of

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,870
n points you can now back up on store so

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,960
I can

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,200
choose back up and I can select the

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:35,919
endpoints that I want to back up set all

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:39,370
of those through the password and then I

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,470
will go to download a file it's

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,230
encrypted it contains my information and

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,910
then I could go ahead and restore those

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,590
and that would overwrite the

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:55,300
configuration I have so that's quite

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:58,840
useful other things we've added support

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:02,169
for showing the Claro events so if I go

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,480
to the event few here this is new so you

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:07,180
can see the events across a cloud

00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,190
foundry it's a piece that we have been

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,650
stamped application-level but now we

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:15,520
have them top-level as well and you can

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:18,820
choose to filter by say a crash so you

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,430
can see which patients crash that's also

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,080
quite nice we've done things like make

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,930
sure the feature flags or what's date

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,260
and the new ones have been out of their

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:31,419
descriptions and nicely maybe this a

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,669
little bit harder to demo I'll show we

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:37,960
have made some tweaks to the sizing of

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:39,880
the UI so we use let's see there but

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,940
we've used or we use the angular

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,850
material library that's by default sized

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,430
for more mobile devices tablet devices

00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,600
obviously professional environment you

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,570
know there's a bit more real estate and

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,070
the attempt once it was smaller icons

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:59,200
and boxes it's a bit bit more on so we

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,610
have in those fires with the tech books

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,380
or the browser type where you can

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,140
determine whether it's a desktop in

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,240
Brandon and then we shrink things down a

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,370
little bit so you'll see that if you're

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,780
looking carefully that we are just

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:16,360
trying to do those kind of URL funds

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:20,680
across the board okay so what is next

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,200
the coming up I guess version 4 will be

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,900
in July or August hopefully the main

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,120
update there is around some sort of

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,030
reworked to support extensions which

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,310
I'll talk about more in a second and

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,169
then bug fixes so we're working through

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,680
a lot of kind of bug fixes and some of

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:38,780
the smaller issues and improvements

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,820
had on the back walk for a while too

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,289
many to mention Everts will what to

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,650
really try and get through as many as we

00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:47,300
can it's gonna be a version for we are

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,919
making some changes to the extensions

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,139
which means that if you've created a

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,120
theme previously or you've quite a

00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,949
front-end extension then you will need

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,660
to read your vows lightly because won't

00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,539
be changing the way things are

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,979
structured so you will want you to make

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:02,630
changes so in that sense is a breaking

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:03,440
change hence that's why we welcome to

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,419
version 4

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,800
what's wrong keep people updated in

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:13,660
their back channel we will be looking

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,340
this year to be supporting the v3 API

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,750
and I'll talk about in a second we also

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,449
try and ensure that we have

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,490
compatibility with some of the new new

00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:24,620
kind of pieces coming in the cloud

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,940
foundry domain so for example Iranians

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,080
been around for a while it's starting to

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,580
be used more and more we want to make

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,520
sure struck us works well with that when

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,210
you're using only the wrath of Diego

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:37,130
that the new kind of work to have

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,380
clarity foundry to put on kubernetes so

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,150
either cube C F or C F or Kate's we want

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,409
to make sure that Stratos works with

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,250
those those projects of their develop

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:49,159
extensions mechanism I'll talk more

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,199
about that and then also kubernetes

00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:53,090
extensions and some what we've done

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,530
Asuza the bridge tip not streaming and

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,960
seeing if more people are interested in

00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,210
those

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,979
so v3 API supports this has been coming

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,229
for a while we have been following the

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:05,960
work the team's been doing and making it

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,699
our kind of fuse cases or comments known

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,699
to them of getting feedback and giving

00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,729
feedback to them indeed we're figuring

00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:17,870
out how we can continue to support both

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:21,229
B 2 & 3 users as as they have great so

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,909
if you have a foundry that's off e 2 and

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:25,009
then 3

00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:27,710
how kind of simple Stratos work the both

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,080
of those so so we're think about being

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,899
up to support we're looking at obviously

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,120
planning to support and switch over to

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:37,579
the new API so the v3 API is absolute

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,039
different to be - so in addition to it

00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:41,300
being a different API there are some

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,820
different concepts in there

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,890
things like processes tasks deployments

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,540
etc that we need now to bring out

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,360
through the UI that weren't previously

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,000
shown in the v2

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,850
within Stratis so this is a fair chunk

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,320
of work that we've started already

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,329
mainly around the planning investigation

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,459
and you'll see is through the reign of

00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:05,660
the year start to implement these

00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:08,360
realized support so I really I don't

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,089
wanna say too much here what we have

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:16,190
done it's not in the main code yet it's

00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:19,070
in a sort of PFC is allow you to get the

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,690
same view that you would with Diego with

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,459
Irene II so with Diego if you've got

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:27,320
metrics available then you can see which

00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:28,880
which Diego sell a particular care

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,320
factory application business is running

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,610
on we want to make sure that you can get

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,870
the same kind of experience with Irene

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,399
II when you deploy your kubernetes so

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,730
that's something we're going to move

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,970
forward and make available so then the

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,890
big if topic really is around extensions

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,680
if you're familiar with Stratus today we

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,399
kind of already have you already have

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,490
extensions so you can customize an

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,350
extent Stratus you can create new theme

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,350
so if you want to change the look and

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,180
feel then that's fairly easy to do and

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,899
it's way of doing that if you want to

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:09,980
add in new views or change the login or

00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:12,140
add support for new endpoints then do

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,880
that most users of Stratus use it

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,010
clearly for Cloud Foundry or this is

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,560
what you do but we have a sort of

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,000
general mechanism for dealing with end

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,490
points as we call them whether they're

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,240
Clara foundry or vanities for example

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,890
and you can use the extension points to

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,070
add in support for those different types

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:33,140
of end point today and if they have

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,120
different authentication providers

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,519
behind them that you can add support

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,930
those two and there's kind of two areas

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,310
where you can extend obviously in the

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,160
front end which is an angular

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:45,500
application you can extend there and

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,959
also in the back end which is our kind

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:51,949
of API so now ready to go and so this

00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:53,449
you can all do today and that current

00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:55,910
model around this really is sort of

00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:58,370
focal repository so the use case is very

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,380
much and you know user or enterprise

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,350
they want to take Stratos they want to

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,890
maybe add anything and estimated

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,600
function

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,220
and they would do this by forking the

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,100
upholstery and placing their

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,250
customizations within a specific topical

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,709
folder with the intent that this reduces

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:20,209
the conflicts you get when you want to

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:21,680
resync with them without strain but what

00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:24,079
you want to get to is not to make it

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,600
easier to to share those extension so

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,779
this comes to some extent with our own

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,370
experience from Sousa of building the

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,589
Cuban X and how extensions that we've

00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,480
done and then thinking about how could

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,360
we make those available 20 people more

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,470
easily so where we want to get to is it

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,110
start to package things up a bit

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,490
differently so there's is maybe what you

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,610
might think of as the Stratus framework

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:49,370
so they're kind of the default theme the

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,690
store which deals with all of the web

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:55,070
useful data about entities the

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,050
components which design UI library and

00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,350
we will use an angular material here so

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,670
we try not to build components unless

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,920
necessary but we have quite a few

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,660
components that we use that make it

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,100
easier and things that people would

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,260
maybe want to use when doing the

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,790
extensions let me have call which really

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,089
never provides the core of the app in

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,360
terms of you know login structure the

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:18,980
views the about all that kind of stuff

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,449
which all that constitutes the app so

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,459
there's as those we want to turn those

00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,680
into set packages we then want to make

00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:27,860
the Cloud Foundry functionality into an

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,370
extension the autoscaler into an

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,230
extension and where companies like

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,260
Souter have their own customizations

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,180
make those into extensions so that you

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,339
could basically take any of these

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,029
packages and build a version of Stratus

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,839
that includes the functionality you want

00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,940
so I just want to talk a little bit

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,740
about kubernetes extensions I haven't

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,100
got time to show these today in this

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,470
session I just wanted to say susan has

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,690
been developing and maintaining

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,899
extensions for kubernetes and how these

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,610
are all open source actually licensed we

00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,500
keep them separate for now in the Susan

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,380
repository but we see this growing

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,290
interest in the CF community as CF and

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,579
Kate's come together and so we're

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,430
looking to know if people are interested

00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:15,290
in as upstreaming these extensions to

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,730
Stratos so that they are in the upstream

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,829
so yeah

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,350
Austrian and much more easy isn't

00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:22,760
available for others to take in use some

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,279
of the high-level features you can

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,199
register connect multiple kubernetes now

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,300
endpoints and ham repositories you can

00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:32,240
view information for particularly

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,769
kubernetes endpoint you can browse ham

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,170
charts install a hound chart view

00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:39,199
details about a ham release we've

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,820
started to put some analytics genes in

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,339
there so that you can then run analysis

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,470
over your Kube workloads and resources

00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,810
and start to see where there are issues

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,940
and then start to show the relationships

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:54,560
between cuban entity resources more

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:57,199
visually so please let us know if you're

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,180
interested in as taking the kubernetes

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,250
functions we have in the souza

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,610
for post rattles and making that

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,560
available up straight so as I said don't

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,240
have time to us now but if you click on

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,160
this link it'll take you to YouTube

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,720
where I recorded a longer video which

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,380
takes you through some of those Cuba

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:18,110
native extensions so thank you very much

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,029
for listening I hope you enjoyed this if

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,550
you use Stratos please let us know we'd

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:24,170
love to hear from from our users we like

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,449
to hear from people who are taking

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:29,000
Stratos using it with their customers as

00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:31,069
well if you've developed an extension or

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,750
you've customized a theme we love to

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:35,089
know about that so that as we make

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,120
changes we can be mindful of the

00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:40,639
community that uses Stratos your input

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:44,510
really is vital we're looking to improve

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:47,300
and grow Stratos you know going on into

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:49,160
the future we need your your views on

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,260
features you'd like to see your bug

00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,269
reports the improvements for best Doc's

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,389
all that kind of stuff so please engage

00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:59,089
with us as much you can kind of recap

00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:00,889
our focus is on extensibility and making

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:03,380
it much easier for people to contribute

00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:08,089
independently and to really get some

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,560
cracking on the v3 API support thank you

00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:11,829
enjoy the rest of the Claire thank you

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,829
