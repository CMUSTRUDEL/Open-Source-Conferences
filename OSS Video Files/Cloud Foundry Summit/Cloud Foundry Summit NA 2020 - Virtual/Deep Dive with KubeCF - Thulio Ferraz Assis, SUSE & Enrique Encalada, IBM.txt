KubeCF, an open-source distribution of the Cloud Foundry Application Runtime (CFAR), aims to provide developers and enterprises with the best of two worlds, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry, throughout a made easy approach. With KubeCF, users can continue focusing on their business logic development, while running on a container-native landscape, reducing the hassle of doing this from the ground up in Kubernetes. Kubernetes was never built to be a comprehensive platform; technologies like KubeCF can complement Kubernetes. In this talk, Thulio and Enrique will showcase how KubeCF is the bridge that gets us from BOSH releases for VMs to a Kubernetes-native PaaS. You will learn how to use KubeCF on any local development, and get some insights and lessons learned since its inception.
