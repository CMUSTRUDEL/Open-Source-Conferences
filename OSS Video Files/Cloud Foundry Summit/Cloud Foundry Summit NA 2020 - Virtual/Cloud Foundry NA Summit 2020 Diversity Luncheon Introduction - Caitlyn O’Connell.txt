hi everyone and welcome to the Cloud

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,299
Foundry Summit diversity luncheon this

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,280
year's format is obviously a little

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,679
different than our typical luncheon it's

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,059
also 90 degrees in my apartment but I

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,099
hope you're comfortable wherever you are

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,190
and maybe you have a snack on hand in

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,690
lieu of the usual buffet table I want to

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,340
give a special thank you to Steve

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,199
Greenberg our resilience scale for

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,710
sponsoring today's luncheon thank you

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,840
Steve

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,910
if you've never attended one of our

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,349
diversity lunches please know that this

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,269
event has served as a meaningful

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,730
gathering space for our community and

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,590
in-person summits and we know that face

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,719
to face interaction cannot be replaced

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,730
but I believe the content of today's

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,780
diversity luncheon is as eye-opening

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,980
inspirational and topical as always

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,930
hopefully most of you have noticed that

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,940
the United States is facing a reckoning

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,559
in fact you may be able to hear it

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,270
through your speakers right now as cars

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,680
honk in solidarity with the black lives

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,629
matter demonstration that's been

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,850
happening on my street corner every day

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,710
for the last few weeks the Foundation

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,680
supports black lives matter and believes

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,300
in racial equity as a community we have

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,100
the opportunity to take a look at white

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,470
supremacy in the tech industry and

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,450
beyond and learn how we can dismantle it

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,930
we have to hold accountable our

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,170
co-workers CEOs friends family mayors

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,330
governors and ourselves we must not only

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,430
demand change from our policymakers but

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,080
create the change ourselves but using

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,439
the power and privilege of the

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,659
technology industry to take action and

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,369
understand our roles in the story we

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,409
have to have context for how we got to

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,079
where we are I'm excited to introduce

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,939

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,049
of racial inequity building on the

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,270
history of global colonialism and the

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,950
rise of capitalism dr. Butler will

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,020

oppression and speak to the processes of
