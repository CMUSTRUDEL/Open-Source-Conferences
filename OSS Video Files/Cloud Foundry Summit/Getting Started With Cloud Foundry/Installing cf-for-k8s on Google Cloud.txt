Description: 
	Give your developers a PaaS experience they can only dream of!
Install cf-for-k8s on your existing Kubernetes clusters to get the familiar “cf push” experience. All your applications are converted from source code to containers and get staged on your clusters.

CF-for-k8s is an open-source community-driven effort enabled by the Cloud Foundry Foundation.
