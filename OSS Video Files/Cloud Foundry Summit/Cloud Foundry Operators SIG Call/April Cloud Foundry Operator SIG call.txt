okay so let's get started

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:11,660
so you're hear me right so so that I can

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:13,920
get started okay good so first of all

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,700
good morning good afternoon good evening

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,400
everyone

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,310
so thanks for dedicating your time and

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,369
joining this call this is our very first

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,000
meeting first of all exclusively for

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,859
Cloud Foundry operators so before I get

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,189
into the topic so I would like to take a

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,780
couple of minutes to introduce ourselves

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:39,410
so I'm gonna Shanker I work at sa P

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:42,840
mainly has DevOps engineer and and on

00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:45,809
Ravelry platform mainly and I have more

00:00:42,840 --> 00:01:04,670
than seven years of industry ID

00:00:45,809 --> 00:01:07,860
experience and with me I have thank you

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:10,320
thanks Kotik so we can straight away get

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,689
into the topic just to give you an

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,479
overview about the Cloud Foundry

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,030
operators a special interest group so

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,979
the initial idea was like to have a

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,530
dedicated group who are highly

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,509
interested in them something which is

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,490
the happening I would say the how to

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,369
operate the crew from the landscape in

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,220
an efficient way or a better way and

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:33,930
also we wanted to bring all the closed

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,799
foundry operators across the globe

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:41,909
together in a single roof mainly to

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,340
discuss and then engage with them but on

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,439
let's say different ideas and then best

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,520
practices to make it at the efecto

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,229
standard to follow by default by anyone

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,990
who is operating the cloud 400 landscape

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,290
how profoundly platform I would say here

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,630
so with that also if you look at the

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,180
market so we are seeing more and more

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,159
adoption of the Cloud Foundry platform

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,429
as an application development platform

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,890
so which ideally which ideally means

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,380
that there are a lot of responsibilities

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,110
on Cloud Foundry operators

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,420
to manage and provide the first in

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,150
classical foundry platform for the

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,160
application developers to develop and

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,100
deploy and run an application without

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,950
any issues yes who this also evident

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,740
that so we wanted to have such a group

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,500
first of all to come together and then

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,920
discuss and then set the standard and

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,140
also that I wanted to emphasize one more

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,410
thing so why we need a such community

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,940
first of all so I would like to take one

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,760
of the let's say the problem statement

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,580
does what we have also encountered and

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,870
some point let's see how to measure the

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,470
availability of the Cloud Foundry

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,090
platform yes so if you look at it

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,230
different companies they'll be having a

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,080
different way of measuring the

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,360
availability of the Cloud Foundry

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,640
platform yeah so it might be a right way

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,730
they might be considering all the

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,260
aspects of it and then some other said

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,220
if you look at it that might be the

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,770
wrong way

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,650
they might not be taking all the aspects

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,750
of it so this is the exact reasons why

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,600
we need such a community first of all to

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,400
come together and then discuss in and

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,910
out about the Cloud Foundry operations

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,740
and then set the standard and make it by

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,740
default to follow by anyone who is

00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,070
operating the cloud foundry platform

00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,830
with that maybe let's together work on

00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,950
this and then make this happen big yeah

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,710
so with that I will jump to the agenda

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,260
so a gender looks like this it's a next

00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:49,740
wonderfully packed agenda so I will

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:53,040
start with purpose of this new community

00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:55,620
and so odds whatsoever a mission and

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,240
then mission statement and then of

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,660
course we'll be having our a value

00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,810
proposition for this community and how

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,010
this set up is going to work and so we

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,140
have a couple of topics today thanks for

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:14,240
andreas and Martin from aap and also

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,170
from ins and then burnt from SVP also

00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,910
accepting a proposal and then

00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,359
representing its for presenting this

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,790
here today and of course we will close

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,770
with the closing note so what's the next

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:29,220
step and and all those things

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:32,780
yeah so purpose so if you look at our

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,720
local so we have a symbol over here

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:39,120
which ideally resembles let's say the

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,720
engineering excellence so what it

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,180
ideally means so we wanted to apply the

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,300
engineering excellence on top of load

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,699
400 flat form so how exactly this will

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,530
happen so we are going to come together

00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,720
all the Clefairy operators across the

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,340
globe and then we are going to set the

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,680
standard and then we are going to apply

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,039
the engineering excellence and then we

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,770
are going to set the defect to the Cloud

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,440
Foundry platform that the operating yeah

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,560
so this is the main purpose so not only

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,020
that we want to evangelize let's see the

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,130
cloud foundry platform we wanted to

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,710
let's say sit the unique process to be

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:22,560
followed across the globe by experts of

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,080
several organization and exchange the

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,620
the best-in-class practices yeah so this

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:32,849
what our main purpose of so having this

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,330
new community and of course if you take

00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:37,620
really let's say the small case

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,470
small-scale industries and then any of

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,240
the new things whatever it is happening

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,000
so everything will have the mission and

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,530
the vision statement so also v2 also

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,900
have for the mission in the vision

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,090
statement so first of all for this new

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,280
community so mission so we wanted to

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,289
first of all bring the bring in the

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,039
field factor of let's say the cloud

00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:00,240
foundry operations right from the set up

00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:03,719
integration monitoring and they'll the

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,740
feedbacks so also will be having let's

00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:10,289
see the new slack Channel and then this

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,440
this meeting gonna happen every fourth

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:15,270
Ministry of month so we are going to

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,690
capture all the conversation so whatever

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,520
is happening and then so we wanted to

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,070
have this is globally acknowledged

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,070
standard so upon the experts acceptance

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,229
so with that so anyone who is starting

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,940
the CRO foundry a landscape setup yeah

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,490
so they will come over here and then

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:36,180
they should follow this one as a by

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:38,660
default standard here so if somebody is

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,440
starting them the plural landscape of

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,420
of country platform f3 and so at least

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,120
for the vision it really matters so

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,960
because so what we have in mind also the

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,270
people who are there in the call also

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,480
accepts my view so our vision would be

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,610
by 2020 so we wanted to achieve let's

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,050
say the inspire new aspirants across all

00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,480
the verticals of the Cloud Foundry space

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,280
with the global guidelines yeah so that

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,730
will really help for everybody and then

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,880
our under the best-in-class the CRO

00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:14,000
fluently platform and the value

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,380
proposition so the first s I told you

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,660
already so we wanted to bring

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,210
industry-wide experts under the one roof

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,310
so with that actually will be discussing

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,190
so in and out about the cloud foundry

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,230
platform operations and then we'll be

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,690
setting the standard and then we are

00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,280
going to make it as a by default

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:34,190
standard 2 followed by anyone who is

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,470
running the foundry platform setup yeah

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,660
and then so we wanted to share the best

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:42,020
practices and then guidelines it say

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:44,330
somebody starting fresh today so they

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,240
will for them the go-to place would be

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,730
them so the other community first of all

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,360
which we subtly started Alex II in the

00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,680
get up channel or L so we'll be having

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,710
you know the slack channel so they will

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,090
come here and then they'll get all the

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,330
informations so that they can get

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:05,450
started and then they'll be setting up

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:07,820
the best cloud foundry platform yeah and

00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,890
then so we wanted to set up a global

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:14,780
consumable framework ur so what does it

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:16,730
mean here is that let's say we wanted to

00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,830
provide all the information so which is

00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:22,490
relevant for let's see as the landscape

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,290
setup may be very small and small scale

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,690
set up and then be it a very large-scale

00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,180
set up so for that terms good there will

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,520
be a the consumable framework will it's

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,229
a bit for the monitoring and then for

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,950
the update and then for other things

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,570
also so this actually they can chicken

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,340
consume it actually according to they

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,820
need you know this is also one thing

00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,669
actually

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,680
what's our community value proposition

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,900
would be and then so we wanted to

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,510
publish all the validated protocols

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,580
which suits the need of an inducer so

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,920
inducer here would be all the

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,870
good phone to operators yeah this is the

00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,170
some rules actually we will be valid

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,240
soon any companies follow so different

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,950
rules here so basically here the

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,550
conclusion would be or what we are

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:09,560
trying to address here is we'll take the

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:13,760
many rules from different companies and

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:17,480
then we wanted to validate their rules

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,959
and then make it as let's say make it as

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,500
a the standard and then we will they are

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,510
going to publish as a suitable validated

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:31,550
protocol to the inducer all the cloud

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:34,220
foundry operators this is going to be

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:37,700
our setup this is our setup is going to

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,980
work what you see over here is the

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,930
network and then the standard so both

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,810
are going together a backbone of this

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,940
community and with that we have three

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,529
pillars then let's say the one is being

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,680
the technology and then another one is

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:54,890
the process another one is the KPI also

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,720
this community basically will take up

00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,610
all the challenges and then all the

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,279
questions related to the technology and

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,100
then process em and then of course KPIs

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,779
for the community to myself the matrix

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,899
okay how many people are coming in and

00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:10,760
then how many people are getting

00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,920
benefitted out of this community and

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:17,990
then how many are contributing this

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:21,350
community to achieve let's say achieve

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,220
the goal of now that the boundary

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,760
operations

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:29,360
easy yeah so all those things we also

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,640
and then when you take technology so

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,670
basically here we wanted to give the

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,100
support of let's say a different tools

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,110
as well let's say if somebody is setting

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,750
up a new landscape or sitting with new

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,060
Cloud Foundry platform so basically

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,010
there will be a lot of tools being used

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:50,420
for them yeah so be it for monitoring

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:52,370
and then our update of that platform and

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,959
then all those other things yes so for

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,910
that if we wanted to give support for

00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:59,420
the technology also what they can use it

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:05,060
by default which which comes with a by

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:06,470
default of older older older well under

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,269
by default things

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,940
yeah and then of course for the process

00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:13,779
yeah so we wanted to let's say take some

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:17,899
of the process and then we wanted to

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:20,389
give them as by default a process to

00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:24,860
follow so be for the monitoring and then

00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:26,689
update of course yeah so with that this

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,459
about this introductions I just wanted

00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:30,439
to tell so why first of all we need this

00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,170
community and all those things it

00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:37,279
actually we come to the that the topics

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:40,189
for the day yeah maybe I can hand over

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,860
it to address and Martine so it's about

00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:46,959
keeping in landscapes blooming so maybe

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,959
undressing voting can take over yeah

00:11:49,250 --> 00:12:01,300
good morning from from Germany yeah this

00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:06,110
is a presentation from us from actually

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,550
nearly two years ago when we initially

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,670
did that at the Cloud Foundry summit in

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:16,069
Basel and we naturally updated a little

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:17,509
bit for today but actually being quite

00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,490
happy that all of the things that we

00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:27,470
showed at this time are still very well

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:31,850
it for us as a team yeah welcome from my

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:34,660
side as well introduce speaking here and

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:40,240
hoping that we could use some

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:44,149
information today on our team looks like

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,480
showing a couple of tools mechanics how

00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:50,660
we monitor or just to give some food

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,930
aboard and maybe some input for further

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,959
discussions exchange then on the

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,430
community and if we look at coffees

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,110
introductory slides also time to

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,059
technology spec would be interesting to

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,069
see if you at least recognize some of

00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:05,839
the tools that we use that you also have

00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:07,819
them otherwise we already have a lot of

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,430
discussions on this first pillar in

00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:13,639
there okay and probably we come to a

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,370
first introduction of our team so

00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:20,360
basically yeah as we work for SAT

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:23,480
naturally global is

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:29,019
normal thing for us so we are working

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:31,639
from four locations mainly and the

00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:35,809
landscapes we have are now also spread

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:39,319
across the globe so to just give you a

00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:44,299
rough idea of the size that we that we

00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:48,189
talk about our landscapes yeah and what

00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:52,069
we want to show or talk about today is

00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:54,709
actually a little bit wider we will

00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:57,049
press this landscape pattern in there in

00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,999
all of our presentations so much a

00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:00,889
little bit of the working mode so so gob

00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:03,920
reintroduced himself and Karthik as

00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:08,449
DevOps engineers and I guess deaf ops or

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:16,339
we often call it up Steph one oh why how

00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:18,799
we actually live that okay how do we

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:21,889
live that collaboration with all the

00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,689
other teams here there's AP and the

00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,730
third one yes really though basically

00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:29,540
the question the monitoring and -

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:31,759
selection that we have to keep yes

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:38,919
somehow our landscapes healthy but also

00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:38,919
ourselves healthy in everyday work okay

00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:51,410
so so basically when you think landscape

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,449
gardening people have very different

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,419
opinions some people want to have a

00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:58,040
garden full of trees and and probably

00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:03,589
vegetables and fruits and so on that you

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:07,399
can harvest other people one flowers or

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:10,129
just a meadow to enjoy the view of the

00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,110
garden and against also for Cloud

00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:15,290
Foundry people have very different ideas

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:18,889
and what to do with such a such a

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:23,709
landscape is it just a form for the sake

00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:23,709
of Technology is it for really hosting

00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,160
mission-critical

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:33,600
epic

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,830
making money with that so what does do

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,300
you want the latest greatest technology

00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,740
and they all do you want stable

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,740
operations so there a lot of different

00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:47,940
goals and and and and aims ideas that

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:49,380
people have for such a landscape also

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,200
for a garden there are a couple of

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:56,610
influences that are somehow outside the

00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,070
gardener's reach the whether the the

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:02,730
snails eating up your fruits and so on

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:05,640
this is something that you cannot always

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,490
control but that you have to think about

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,589
what you do with that so if you don't

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,350
think about it at all then you gonna be

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:15,960
hit really badly by such external

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,820
influences and I guess being a gardener

00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,770
or being an operator means that you

00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,120
think about what are the risks what are

00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,450
the things that can happen from the

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,000
outside how do I cope with that so that

00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,920
is I think another place where you see

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,500
this metaphor hopefully working also for

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,690
yourself yeah and and also a garden

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,240
should have couple of results so either

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,010
be the joy of having the garden and the

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,620
fun of working with the landscape since

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:43,980
we do that for a couple of years I think

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:46,290
the joy factor is okay but you also want

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,850
to to to to harvest something from the

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,850
garden so a landscape which is not

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:53,100
commercially successful will be a CF and

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:57,270
scape that won't exist for a long time

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:59,970
so trying to keep all of these goals in

00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:03,450
sync is I guess one of the basic

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:11,100
requirements that we see in running and

00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:14,459
a such landscape hey I would like to

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:18,120
continue with some information on how we

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:22,439
work together as a team I would look

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:25,709
like in our team starting with a rough

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:32,390
timeline over the last couple of years

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:37,250
so we started with our endeavor in 2015

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:40,690
or taking that metaphor again seeding

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,630
seeding the first boundary landscape

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:48,850
of the next couple of months and years

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:51,640
people growing hungry landscape from one

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:56,020
landscape it became several Cloud

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,990
Foundry installations landscapes the

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:02,970
size of the landscapes was growing

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,970
additional requirements coming in

00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,220
environments regarding certifications or

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:12,640
exam before I saw said compliance or

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:15,160
compliance which again brings tourists

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,080
from outside into the operations aspect

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,450
on how you run the processes on how to

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,620
operate or how you do changes on a

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:27,010
landscape increasing the complexity for

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:32,020
our day-to-day business and yeah

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:34,720
meanwhile over the years in additional

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:38,410
hyper scalars have been added for that

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,920
meanwhile as a platform runs on various

00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:46,510
hyper scale er providers like AWS or DCP

00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:50,170
and others any are over the recent years

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:54,010
more and more landscapes we're popping

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:57,610
up over the different countries over the

00:18:54,010 --> 00:19:04,090
globe to serve customer needs from

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:07,390
different countries over the globe for

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:10,480
more information on the content of our

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:13,420
cloud platform of course a is called

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,320
foundry as such as a runtime for the

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:19,510
applications there's more there's

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,720
services which can be consumed used by

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:25,000
applications like PostgreSQL like a

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,380
MongoDB like a rabbit and hue messaging

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,150
service so that's our services which are

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,540
part of the cloud platform which need to

00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,220
be updated configured scaled and all the

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,370
other activities you do if you operate

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,070
operate a foundry platform we use

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:46,210
concourse for the deployment for the

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:50,590
update of our names technology part of

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:52,720
here which you might use as well so this

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,490
is a landscape itself various

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,570
technologies inside there

00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:01,029
and additionally to that one or to the

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:04,119
lens cap itself we have some central

00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:08,619
tooling like agenda which we use as

00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:12,669
scheduling tool technology we use graph

00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:17,259
honor for visualizing exports to holiday

00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:19,419
to out of data we come to that in a

00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,450
minute and we have an elastic search

00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:24,279
next to our Jenkins for the locks of the

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:28,059
drops as we have a lot of tops running

00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:30,220
on Jenkins doing a lock of a Jenkins

00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:33,399
drop in Jenkins itself can be done but

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:36,009
if you have many of those it becomes

00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:40,119
tedious so we are using there again a

00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:43,529
well known logging stack for the lock

00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,529
visualization in storing

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,510
we're just asking in-between are there

00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:53,060
any questions until now we'd just avoid

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:56,950
rushing through the slides and just to

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,950
check in between any questions until now

00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:08,200
okay then let's continue as we are doing

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,720
DevOps as already mentioned we have a

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,379
couple of let's call it buckets in our

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,620
team different topics where we have to

00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:18,820
balance the capacity of our team on a

00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,269
ball one inside

00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:24,220
left hand side here on the picture we

00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:25,840
have to keep all the different landscape

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,460
systems running which has the topmost

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:33,639
priority so a family platform which is

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:37,029
not running which is updated which has

00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:39,940
an issue is not good for us as a people

00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:43,629
as well for the customers if there's

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:46,119
anything to do this is something you

00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:49,119
have to do as a backdrop and our team on

00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:51,279
the other end we not only have the

00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,619
operations task in our team but we have

00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:56,590
development improvement tasks innovation

00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:59,799
tasks in our team

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:03,119
for example automating processes which

00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:06,279
have been done manually at the beginning

00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,200
thinking about a new monitor which needs

00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,440
to be set up or an existing monitor or

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,230
which needs to be improved doing some

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,110
proof of concept for an orders a new

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,970
version of Khurana which you would like

00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:22,269
to consume so we need to give it a try

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,610
to see which value a new version of

00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:26,679
Khanna is giving and so these are the

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:30,009
different buckets which we have to

00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:33,399
balance in our team we always try to

00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:35,259
ensure that we are not doing ops only

00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:37,379
that we have some innovation in

00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:40,659
equipment activities in our team as well

00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:43,570
to reduce the operations effort over

00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,789
time and you are the easy goal on our

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,440
team is really to kind of have an even

00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:49,509
balance between those keep the system

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,629
running and those improvement innovation

00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:55,509
tasks at least on the wrong long run and

00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:58,059
IP exceptions for one or the other side

00:22:55,509 --> 00:23:00,850
for a certain week or a month but

00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:03,759
overall we try to balance the effort and

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:06,549
if we see that for whatever reason there

00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:09,309
is an imbalance that operations effort

00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:10,929
has increased for example because

00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:12,639
there's a new landscape being set up or

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:16,539
the size of a landscape

00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:17,950
increases the operations effort we have

00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:20,229
to invest into innovation and

00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:28,179
improvement topics to again reduce the

00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:31,029
operational effort okay then

00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:34,950
team set up besides the different

00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:39,399
locations what we need in our team is

00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:43,929
again a combination of generalist big

00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:46,479
people so no let's say a little bit of

00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:48,070
everything so of course we need to all

00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:50,379
team members on our team need to

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:53,499
understand what our foundry is how our

00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:55,959
foundry works how to use concourse to

00:23:53,499 --> 00:24:00,369
trigger a deployment job or to use graph

00:23:55,959 --> 00:24:03,789
ana to create a desk or to visualize

00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:08,349
data so we need to know a little bit of

00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:11,979
everything as well we need for certain

00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:14,649
topics especially for foundry or other

00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:17,320
components we need as well as

00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:19,719
specialists or specialized know-how to

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:24,429
be able to do a deep dive into some

00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:28,229
issue investigation to find the root

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:30,849
cause of an issue so it's characters be

00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:32,799
experts in one area but we need to know

00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:37,269
all the different components as shown on

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,879
a bill of material slide previously we

00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:42,129
always have to balance between things we

00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:44,559
have to do right now so if there is an

00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:46,929
incident on a landscape we have to start

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:52,029
investigating right now we have to try

00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:55,659
to fix it as soon as possible to have it

00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:57,639
up and running again but again we have

00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:00,159
to think about long-term things so there

00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:04,329
might be broke around shortcuts you do

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,789
short term to fix something that might

00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:08,859
increase the technical depth which

00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:11,739
either our team or somebody else set as

00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:14,859
ap would have to cover so we as well

00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:17,919
have to think long term and if we do

00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:22,539
some workarounds or our cuts to for

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:25,020
example a fix an issue in the middle of

00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:28,830
the picture what we want to tell

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:31,350
that one is our development teams for

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:35,550
the different services they might have

00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:38,460
ideas from the development team there

00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:40,290
might be a new technology in the

00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,230
community being available and you too

00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:45,750
will being available so that besides

00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:49,080
that short term maybe even a little

00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:54,120
fixing we get ideas from other teams

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:57,090
which you can then implement or use in

00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,830
our day-to-day operations business so -

00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:03,410
one thing that's probably important here

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:08,750
as well is that there is also especially

00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:11,880
with this naturally the balance between

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,800
the certification and the well-being of

00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,080
a landscape right that you have fixed

00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,730
procedures who's allowed to change to

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,400
access a landscape how can you do

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:22,050
changes to the landscape and so on which

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,550
which you definitely need for a

00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,800
productive landscapes especially if you

00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,630
think about critical castle payload on

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,000
top of it at the same time you need to

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,010
have this approach that you can get new

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,350
ideas into the landscapes a lot of the

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,670
the backlog that that Martin showed

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,620
before with the innovate and improve

00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,110
table is also about the question how can

00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,840
you get DevOps

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:46,620
really running or upstair I should say

00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:51,420
up step on a on a productive landscape

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:57,870
so that developers have a good access to

00:26:51,420 --> 00:27:00,690
the landscape but also have the chance

00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:03,840
to do the the things they need to do on

00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:09,170
the landscape in a proper compliant way

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:11,970
so all of this is I think part of this

00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:13,440
collaboration setup we have with the

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,160
development teams for the large

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,280
landscapes

00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,440
and that hopefully leads to the last

00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,650
picture from time to time that we really

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,750
have success that we can celebrate

00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:29,020
together so it's never a singer team who

00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,800
is really fixing something or improving

00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:36,040
something it's always a cross effort and

00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:37,540
to to do this to do team rotation to do

00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,190
we have people from the deaf teams

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:44,500
working with our team to to hand over a

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:48,780
landscape a productive hands came to

00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:51,460
development teams to do let's a detailed

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:54,040
analysis or so on in there that is

00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,620
important and that is I think the key to

00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,230
success and that means also really

00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:02,980
building the trust between the different

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:06,120
teams working towards the success of

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,120
such a platform

00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:19,580
okay okay next chapter um we would like

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,980
to show you a couple of ideas and tools

00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:25,970
betwee used to monitor our different

00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:28,340
landscapes but before that coming back

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:31,400
to our garden metaphor again in the

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:34,820
garden might be rather easy to see

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,520
whether certain plants are healthy or

00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:41,210
not looking at the tomato plant on a

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,810
left-hand side it's rather obvious

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:47,660
this one looks healthy turning to the

00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:49,910
right hand side this tomato plant well

00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,760
it's not even really visible that was

00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,920
this is a tomato at all from yeah that

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,460
doesn't really look healthy so in the

00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:00,760
garden it might be a bit easier but for

00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,820
a formula it s andreas already mentioned

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:07,850
yeah that one of the most critical

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:11,330
information for us is the question is

00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,980
our platform I've been running at the

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,020
platform we mean all those different

00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,750
services like how hungry itself and

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,820
which already is a lot of things so can

00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,640
I put an application is my application

00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:25,250
running can i scale an application can i

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,510
lock input we already caught zombie

00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:34,130
itself as a lot of use cases or API

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:35,750
endpoints which eco work plus all the

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,300
other components like the backing

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,660
services or exam the post press as well

00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,280
which need to work as well and one of

00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,230
the main questions is all those

00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:50,000
components I've been running and can be

00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:52,070
used by our customers and users at the

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,120
very beginning we started with a kind of

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:57,530
black box monitoring setup so on the

00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,430
left hand side we have our different

00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:05,150
landscapes running and we have our

00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:07,490
Dinkins serving monitoring against those

00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:11,320
landscapes so that one single said then

00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:15,170
think it's the insulation is firing

00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,990
scenarios against our landscapes for

00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:21,080
example it tries to push an application

00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,640
Foundry first of all it has to lock onto

00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,210
Cloud Foundry it tries to push an

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,410
application it tries to consume

00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,530
different backing services

00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:32,120
binding that to the application and as

00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,920
one of the last steps checking whether

00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,460
the application is I've been running and

00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:40,820
can be pinged accessed from outside so a

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,220
lot of activities which a I would say a

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,470
usual developer on top of a foundry

00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,240
platform is doing putting a new version

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,809
of an application consuming making

00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:54,070
services and after that checking the

00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:57,500
application using it we have called that

00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,960
monitor the developer scenario because

00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,880
it simulates usual activities a

00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:06,260
developer on top of the platform is

00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,580
doing the thing is stung by our engines

00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,420
against each and every of those

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:14,000
landscapes and the success or the

00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:17,800
failure of that monitoring execution is

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:22,040
then later on stored in an influx TV

00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:25,970
from our experience a very nice time

00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:27,410
series database which can easily be and

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,290
greatly be used for those kind of things

00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:32,740
so we store the data and influx TV and

00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:35,570
visualize it with Hana

00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,840
one of the main patterns behind the

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:41,870
setup is the idea that the lens cap

00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,090
itself should have a neck controlled way

00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,460
which people are allowed to access a

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:51,140
landscape of course consumers users can

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:52,880
access a landscape because they can

00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:56,300
authenticate and I have either board

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,000
services on the platform or for example

00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,620
we from the operations team we are

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,600
allowed to access it in scape but it's

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,929
control with not everybody can see all

00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,450
the details of the landscape but the

00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:10,340
status of a landscape is boundary it's a

00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,470
certain service up and running this is

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:17,030
information which everybody should be

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:18,830
able to see the world here we only in

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,010
the entire world but it's rather tsap

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:24,710
world so somebody from program

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:27,110
management somebody from sales somebody

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:30,519
from I don't know delivery management a

00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:32,980
developer in a development team

00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,409
everybody who is interested in that data

00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:38,200
I should be able to see it without the

00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:41,559
need about the permission to actually

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,570
access the data in the landscape because

00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,460
the landscape has customer data in it we

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:48,399
as mentioned we have those certification

00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:52,210
requirements which for example require a

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:55,509
control with user access so that we try

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:57,309
to divide which permissions and which

00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:01,289
group of people can see the monitoring

00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:04,720
data compared to who is able to access

00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:06,940
boundary installation itself and with

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,710
that one so we achieved that the graph

00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,220
on our dashboards are public everybody

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,480
can open them see them to see the data

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,590
but the access to the landscape itself

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,590
is restricted

00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:25,360
how did that look like in more practical

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,600
ways this is a screenshot of one of our

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,700
graphing our dashboards which we have

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,380
one tile in in this dashboard is one

00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,600
landscape we have

00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:38,740
anonymized the names a little bit too

00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,540
hight at all it's ap secrets yeah the

00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,270
tile is showing the summary of all the

00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:47,230
landscapes we had at that point in time

00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:49,960
it's not a very recent screenshot so on

00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:52,570
this overview dashboard somebody in our

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,320
team or somebody from program management

00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:58,690
some other key person s ap would be able

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,040
to see how many landscapes do exist and

00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,770
what is the status of the different

00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,720
landscapes as it goes probably gets

00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:09,130
green means everything is okay in that

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:12,450
landscape if a tire turns yellow there

00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:15,400
is some issue in the landscape as

00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:18,010
looking at the top left-hand corner and

00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,360
there's one landscape running on

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,929
OpenStack which is called a hotfix

00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,669
landscape that tile only turned yellow

00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:27,580
because it's a hot hot fix landscape so

00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:29,830
it's an SI p internal landscape which we

00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:33,190
use for validation of product hot fixes

00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:36,010
there is no custom on it so the priority

00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:38,560
of that issue which happened in the

00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:41,380
landscape would not be that high

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,270
compared to a life landscape and of

00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:47,260
course different monitors have different

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:49,330
priorities if you are up on top of your

00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:53,500
platform is not running this is probably

00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:57,360
very severe if you can't push in it an

00:34:53,500 --> 00:35:00,640
update might be important as well

00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,320
depending on your use case just to given

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,630
you ends up an example that for all the

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,570
monitors we have they are testing

00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,800
different endpoints different use cases

00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:12,480
and these once again have different

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,400
priorities so that we can distinguish

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,410
which landscape has higher priority than

00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,080
another one in which money toward has a

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:26,290
higher priority than a different one eat

00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:29,530
or oh yeah yes at that point how enjoy

00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:32,349
Soviet two landscapes which had an issue

00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:36,020
and all the other ones agree

00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:38,569
as we mentioned we have several money

00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,579
towards which we fire against the

00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:44,569
different landscapes so this deaf word

00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:47,030
here gives you an overview then somebody

00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:49,119
on our team seeing for example that this

00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:54,170
OpenStack perfect landscape has an issue

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:56,000
that person can click on it and graph

00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:58,579
Ana would bring you to a more detailed

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,619
dashboard showing the status of all the

00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:02,839
individual monitors which we run against

00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:05,030
in in scape so from that all of you it's

00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:10,060
just one click and it gives you the

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:14,359
details which of the monitor is failing

00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:16,609
and even more if the operator would then

00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:20,900
click on the tile with the ping

00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:25,790
monitoring app for a trial if the

00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:28,880
operator would click on that tile sorry

00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:31,940
for that one you would end up on our

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,720
tangents showing the block of the

00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:38,060
monitoring execution of course this

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,829
click then is kind of reserved for

00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,780
somebody from the operations team who is

00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:43,760
allowed to see Jenkins and to access

00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,089
Jenkins and to see the build locks

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:52,490
because if my contain critical

00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:55,730
information so that this link cannot use

00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:58,849
by everybody ASAP for the operator who

00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:02,240
has he permissions for with two clicks

00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:04,849
he would see is the failure for example

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,530
for the CF locked in step is failing in

00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:10,670
the developer scenario so that would

00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:12,680
easily see in the block and all the

00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,690
others can at least see the status of

00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,329
the landscapes and which of the monitors

00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:21,440
are failing hopefully no monitor is

00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:23,359
failing so we had we are using Raphaella

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,940
I mean an impact CV to visualize the

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,910
later and to share it with all the

00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:31,849
others which for example visits trust

00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,680
the different teams if you're if you

00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,060
don't know the status of the landscape I

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,250
don't know you might start asking

00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,740
questions you might know interpret

00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,990
certain things but if the status of an

00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:45,099
instep is always visible just builds

00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,099
trust between different teams

00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:56,430
before we come to the next our example

00:37:52,619 --> 00:38:01,400
on how which tools we use to operate our

00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:04,430
net escapes and questions until you

00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,819
I did want to ask this all looks really

00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:12,349
great like just a general question how

00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:13,670
many say DevOps people do you have and

00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:17,200
how many foundations are there

00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,200
maintaining would be my question

00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:28,460
landscapes

00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:30,319
there's a couple of life there's a

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,210
couple of for fixed landscapes is the

00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:34,009
numbers are varying you you would have

00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:37,719
to check honestly I'm not sure how many

00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:41,569
we expose right now to our customers as

00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:46,940
its life landscape should be somewhere

00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:49,819
in something like this and a couple of

00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:52,729
offices yet sometimes we just add a

00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:56,509
couple of test landscapes for us in

00:38:52,729 --> 00:39:00,289
addition so it's somewhere we have some

00:38:56,509 --> 00:39:03,229
around general at least twenty

00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:07,519
landscapes that we have and we operate

00:39:03,229 --> 00:39:11,329
with the four locations in a five by

00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:13,460
twenty one mode and I'm depending on

00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:21,430
summer time settings and sometimes also

00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:21,430
five by twenty two and we had 25 people

00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:32,989
okay so different kind of visualization

00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:35,420
here again with katana is the deployment

00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:37,700
status so the examples formatting before

00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,890
were basically showing okay how healthy

00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,079
is the landscape but a different view

00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,609
also very important not only for the

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,289
development teams but also for the

00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:49,910
people let's say who who are interested

00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:51,410
in a new features and so on that they

00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:55,279
want to consume on top of the landscape

00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:58,579
is what is actually deployed on the

00:39:55,279 --> 00:40:00,650
landscape and here we use as you

00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:02,660
probably remember from the previous

00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,249
slides the fact that we have conquerors

00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,549
running in all the landscape and reveals

00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:11,299
concourse for the updates of landscape

00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:14,140
and basically the deployments report the

00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:16,569
data break into our sin

00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:22,000
in flux TB and and with this we can just

00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:25,990
see okay looking for example at the

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,779
product itself so are all is a certain

00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:31,869
landscape actually on the latest version

00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:36,010
of our let's say Cloud Foundry platform

00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:37,960
product if it is not on the latest

00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,789
version of the product then you see this

00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,329
unmerged commits from the product where

00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:44,349
branch

00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:46,650
so the overall the landscape needs to be

00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:50,559
updated

00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:54,910
then we have something that is subset of

00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:56,710
our deployments is not updated yet

00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,240
that's normally the fact when the

00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,400
Concours pattern is running so for

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,079
example in CF is already updated but the

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,510
ex takes not updated and so on so you

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,819
can see this differences but sometimes

00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,500
you also see that you have freight

00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:10,900
deployments that for whatever reasons

00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,730
the certain deployment could not be

00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:16,660
updated and this is shown there with a

00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:18,220
red statement fail deployments or

00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,069
missing deployments that something is

00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:24,940
not ideal and that basically means you

00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:27,579
have to get active as either naturally

00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:31,630
us as the operational team who's looking

00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:33,700
to get deployments in there but also if

00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:36,009
for example you as a development team

00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:40,180
want to know okay how are things going

00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:42,130
from my component you could take a look

00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,750
here and again if you think about it

00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:47,140
this is right now just trying to say an

00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,819
order screenshot with with 10 tiles but

00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,089
already thinking going into each

00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:54,130
concourse UI logging in and so on and

00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:56,349
shaking is everything green this is a

00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:59,440
much faster view because basically most

00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:01,390
of the time it's it's a quiet picture

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,250
right there's nothing there they're just

00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:05,490
like the typical tiles all Blake was a

00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:09,940
little bit of white text on top of it

00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:12,130
and only the occasional we of course

00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,589
took like a more active screenshot here

00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:17,349
you have the occasional messages that

00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:19,029
there's something no to be done so if

00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:22,509
you see a landscape where you see okay

00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:23,890
there's yellow or even red information

00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:25,990
on it you again click on the tile and

00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,579
then you come to the details and then he

00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:32,039
would really see

00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:35,319
okay what is the status of my individual

00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:37,630
departments you see here we have I guess

00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:39,609
that's specific to the way how we update

00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,739
our landscapes we have a whole bunch of

00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:45,249
things that we put together into one

00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:48,069
product pointers who to see so to say

00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:52,499
and then we see on top that this

00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:55,869
landscape is not consuming right now for

00:42:52,499 --> 00:42:57,940
hot fixes that were available within the

00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:02,799
product so this is something way to

00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:04,569
update the whole landscape itself and

00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:08,289
then we see that basically everything

00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:12,910
looks pretty nicely the same status is

00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:14,709
just that one of the components in the

00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:17,619
object store service could not be

00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:19,690
updated properly so that is a that is

00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:21,489
our typical drill down again this is

00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:23,680
this is where it ends for the people

00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:25,059
without further permissions but this is

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,160
already sufficient right if you would be

00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:29,289
a stakeholder you could contact object

00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,789
store service team if you're an operator

00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:32,349
you know where to look into if you are

00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:34,839
the development team you know how to

00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:36,759
look into it basically most operational

00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:38,680
people anti-development people have

00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:40,930
access to the landscape to do the

00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,459
further checks but these checks as

00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,930
Martin said you do within the landscape

00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:45,880
you don't want to see that on some

00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,949
aggregated view there anymore because

00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,420
this is technical details that the

00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:51,339
consumers of the landscape would

00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:55,539
probably not be really interested in

00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:58,239
that point in time okay and this is

00:43:55,539 --> 00:44:03,190
where the the examples of things we

00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:06,130
already had at this time so there are

00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:08,969
always more plans for for aggregating

00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:11,739
data and and and automating things so

00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:15,039
one example here for example Martin said

00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:17,109
that we do a lot of oh the developer

00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:19,930
scenario that Marty explained that's the

00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:23,949
typical black box monitoring but there's

00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:27,369
lots of data of course also available

00:44:23,949 --> 00:44:32,979
white box by just looking into the

00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:34,749
actual data from the produced by the

00:44:32,979 --> 00:44:37,569
components within the landscape itself

00:44:34,749 --> 00:44:39,489
so the Concours status of the deployment

00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:41,050
is probably already one good example

00:44:39,489 --> 00:44:43,420
that I showed before where we

00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:46,780
just say okay the deployment status you

00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,730
can really you don't need to do any

00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,230
checks from the outside concourse itself

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:59,190
while deploying is providing us with

00:44:50,230 --> 00:45:03,390
this information but here you can again

00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:08,050
aggregate even further so this is a

00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:10,030
newer view on the actual deployment

00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:13,210
status so could be suppose that we saw

00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:16,360
that for for a single landscape patrol

00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:18,130
down now let's say I don't even sure how

00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,050
old the boom table clacking is for

00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:26,710
katana but this as one it's a great help

00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:29,980
with kind of your eyes again monitoring

00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:35,710
or you dashboard it doesn't show you the

00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:38,110
full list of landscapes we have one

00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:42,610
pipeline in in concourse which is which

00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:44,470
we use to update a landscape and we have

00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:46,900
that landscape n times because you have

00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:51,430
n Netscape's and as Congress as part of

00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:54,450
the landscape itself if one would like

00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:59,590
to know the status of let's say 15

00:45:54,450 --> 00:46:00,880
concourse pipelines or 15 in escapes you

00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:03,910
can of course open all the different

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,830
individual you is in concourse and

00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:09,640
checks a status but the staff would here

00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:11,860
gives you an aggregation again on the

00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:16,510
rows in the table you see the different

00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:18,490
dots of the pipeline which are doing the

00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:21,100
different little steps of the different

00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:23,890
components and in the columns you see

00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,750
again the different landscapes and

00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,340
similar to the monitoring hopefully

00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,800
everything is green and we as an

00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:34,690
operator happen in a relaxed state if

00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:37,240
not one cell here in the table might

00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:41,140
turn red and then again similar to

00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,910
monitoring if you click on that cell you

00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,970
end up on the right hand side you end up

00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:48,490
in concourse in the landscape again the

00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:52,610
same approach the summaries aggregation

00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:53,960
is accessible by everybody in s IP

00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:56,240
you then would like to follow the link

00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,670
to the electric concourse installation

00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,580
and you would like to see the MOC which

00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:04,430
might contain secrets you never know

00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:07,370
listen of course is reserved to a

00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:10,010
limited set of people you know

00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:11,600
operations team as well as for the

00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:14,480
development team owning a certain

00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:17,120
service so that they can see the log

00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,800
file investigate why I was failing and

00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,670
for example we trigger the deployment

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,670
after fixing the issue

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:33,340
okay that's basically what we have

00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:36,260
collected for for today to give you some

00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:38,600
insights in how we work as a team how is

00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:42,620
our setup in which tools technologies we

00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:44,960
use our hope would be that in the

00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:47,320
co-operators community as question it's

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:51,200
a robbery at the very beginning we can

00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:53,390
exchange on how you operate your work

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:57,520
foundry installations which tools you

00:47:53,390 --> 00:48:00,920
use which challenges you face yeah

00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:03,320
hopefully gain some more insights get

00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,320
some ideas on new things in the

00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:09,670
community which can ease the drop of us

00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,670
as operators

00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:24,589
that's basically from our presentation

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:26,329
any questions I just want to thank you

00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:29,420
so much like the just the way that

00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:32,720
you're using Griffin ax and clicking

00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:36,440
through to the Concours pipelines that's

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,490
very elegant that's very well done I was

00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,579
actually very impressed with that

00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:42,579
thanks for sharing that Thank You Felipe

00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:50,270
thanks Andres and Martine so if there

00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:53,470
are no further questions maybe we can go

00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:53,470
into the next thing

00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:12,280
okay

00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:14,740
I can see that we are running out of

00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,810
time just five more minutes so we are

00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:19,690
planning to have this second disc second

00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:22,330
topic discussing in the next meet

00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:26,140
so can you just move to the next slide

00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:28,360
so we'll go to the closing notes so this

00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:31,720
is about the closing notes as well as

00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,340
the next steps for the meeting the first

00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,280
one we have created a Google document

00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:38,590
and Google Docs which all of you have

00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,270
access so in this document we are

00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:42,940
maintaining the agenda for the next meet

00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:45,550
as well as if you want to propose any

00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:47,440
topic like you want to discuss you want

00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:50,710
to share with everyone in this meeting

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,290
you can add your topic in this document

00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:56,500
it will be available in next two days so

00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:58,480
all of you can edit this one and this is

00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,120
slack channel four dedicated for

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,280
co-operators so if you have any

00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,350
questions in between you don't have to

00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,910
wait for the meeting you can directly

00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:08,770
post a question we make sure that we'll

00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:12,310
get you the answer as quick as possible

00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:14,110
and if any one of you will not be able

00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,840
to attend the meeting in feature always

00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:19,330
you can go back to this YouTube channel

00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,620
this channel will be uploaded the this

00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:22,060
essence what we are having we be

00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:26,290
recorded as well as will be uploaded to

00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:28,630
this YouTube channel integrated link for

00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:33,130
the co-operators so we will create a get

00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:35,530
up page where we'll create a get a wiki

00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:37,150
document for the best practices what we

00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:38,140
have as well as all of you will have

00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:40,000
access to this one

00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:42,700
so if you want to have if you want to

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,260
share your base practice 44 low or any

00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,490
tools that you want to talk about the

00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,640
one which you use for the Cloud Foundry

00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:50,980
obeisance you can create a wiki and you

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,630
can post it in this get up age this will

00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:58,090
also be available in before the next

00:50:52,630 --> 00:51:02,380
meeting and so far the feedback we just

00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:04,750
created one so we link please after the

00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:07,870
meeting just post your feedback here I

00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:09,430
just put it in the chat window post your

00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:11,650
feedback so this will help us to improve

00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:13,210
as well as in the next meet if there is

00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:15,730
anything else that we have to improve

00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:19,030
from outside so this feedback would

00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:21,580
really help us and loss one thing please

00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:23,260
do say this information about this

00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:27,700
community to your colleagues

00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:32,320
- team member so we are just exploiting

00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:34,360
some more topics from all of you so if

00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,390
you're able to come up with some new

00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:41,020
topics so that would be really nice to

00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:43,590

next mate will send her to me about the

00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:01,200
Google talks and get uplink as well as

00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:01,200
they youtube channel so thank everyone

00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:12,630
