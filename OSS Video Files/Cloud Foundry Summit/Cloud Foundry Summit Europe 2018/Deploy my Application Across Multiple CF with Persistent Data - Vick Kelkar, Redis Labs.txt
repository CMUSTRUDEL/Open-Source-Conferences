Description: 
	Deploy my Application Across Multiple CF with Persistent Data - Vick Kelkar, Redis Labs

We have geo-distributed teams; each using a local [P]CF
We have an internal application that needs to sync persistent data between CFs.
Two ways to solve this problem
We could have setup a GeoDNS based solution for CF, sync blobs, VPN etc
We chose to go with an active-active redis replication solution for our needs
We used a bosh-release of redis-enterprise in each CF
 Setup a geo-distributed redis cluster that takes care of replication and consistency using CRDB

So app-developers do a blue-green deploy of their app to both cloud-foundries and the redis-active-active cluster takes care of application persistent data with CRDB.
