[Music]

00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,070
so this is the part of the day to

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,189
keynotes where I'm supposed to look out

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,600
in the audience and count you and then

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,080
point out that half of you left your

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,000
buddies at the bar last night I think

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,050
those of you that made it welcome good

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,350
morning thank you before I get started I

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,940
wanted to take a moment to remind you to

00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,890
please you know go visit the sponsors

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,860
that are out there they make this event

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,100
possible this is not something that we

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,870
make any money on so we are really

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,879
thankful for everything that they do for

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,289
us for you they allow the community to

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,670
get together they allow you to have the

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,300
learning experiences that you're having

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,280
today that you had yesterday so please

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,719
just take a minute talk to the sponsors

00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,719
let them know you appreciate it

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:06,090
so today what I'm going to talk about is

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,290
a little bit of a history lesson as well

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,950
as a little bit of a view into the

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,549
future of the Cloud Foundry platform the

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,479
Cloud Foundry family of projects and

00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:18,030
talk a little bit about some of the

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,580
philosophies that the project teams have

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,380
been bodied for years now and how they

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,090
relate to a lot of the the newer more

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,250
the newer open-source projects that are

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:34,619
part of the larger cloud native

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,119
open-source ecosystem and I titled the

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,939
talk building bridges and we'll come

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,600
back to that so history lesson can

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,890
anybody see that

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,140
yeah 2009 not that long ago right nine

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,820
years but there were some interesting

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,579
things happening in the technology space

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:56,159
back then netbooks were the rage anybody

00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:00,540
here have a netbook yeah a couple of you

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,820
they were the rage also our mobile

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,990
phones started to do things like have

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,039
maps in them that's pretty cool

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,929
anybody here not actually walk around

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,599
Basel with the phone out trying to go I

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,900
think we're going this way right

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,030
become a very different part of our life

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,349
the AppStore became very important it

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,739
wasn't just it wasn't just the Apple

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,879
AppStore

00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,799
right there was a number of different

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,480
app stores for different device

00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:26,510
platforms that became the new way to

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,390
think about software delivery for

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:33,030
consumers for for individuals but also

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,799
at VMware we managed to find the oldest

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,769
logo we could possibly find for VMware

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:40,829
at VMware projects started that was

00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:43,549
called b-29 this is the beginnings of

00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:46,560
the idea of creating the Cloud Foundry

00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:49,019
platform as a service product that we do

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,340
we know today the project that we know

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,069
today that's been incorporate it into

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,620
the pivotal Cloud Foundry s ap cloud

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,090
platform IBM's product everybody's

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,540
product is based on this original idea

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,739
from from back in 2009 that's not really

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,419
that long ago if we're talking about

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,829
history but I guess in tech industry

00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:09,209
it's like a month is the equivalent of a

00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:12,840
decade these days so we really do have a

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,879
very long history as a community as a

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,530
project even before it became

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,909
open-source there's there's a deep rich

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,729
history behind the project

00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:22,530
and fast forward to today Abey yesterday

00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:26,909
was talking a bit about the challenge

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,530
that the enterprise has today we're at

00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:30,750
an inflection point we know that most

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,569
organizations now are focused on

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,430
adopting cloud adopting cloud native

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,310
technologies whether it's on Prem off

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,949
from public cloud mixing and matching

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,349
it's a bit of a mess for them right it's

00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,720
really hard actually because you have to

00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,769
get things from your vendors and I love

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,019
all of the vendors in the room right

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:53,280
clearly you're trying to solve these

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,840
problems for your customers but it is

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,000
very difficult because you also have

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,859
internal team pressure you also have a

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,540
third party open source projects that

00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:04,439
are it's confusing right there's a lot

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:07,680
of things going on and we have tried as

00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,750
the Cloud Foundry community to help at

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,739
least make the part that we touch a

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,939
little bit easier this isn't me these

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,409
are the contributors these are the

00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,349
committers these are the project leads

00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:21,419
that actually build the software they

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:24,180
spend a lot of time thinking about what

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:26,760
does it mean to create enterprise ready

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,100
software that's pretty close to product

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,010
that the the downstream distributions

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,050
are able to productize that someone can

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,540
use directly as open source and get a

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,810
lot of value from they focus on things

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,900
like security scaling integration ease

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,820
of use really ease of uses about that

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,979
developer experience right that's the

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:52,139
Haiku here's my source code run another

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:53,699
cloud for me I don't care how and the

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,300
other thing that the community focuses

00:04:53,699 --> 00:05:00,960
on are these three areas of I guess

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,870
philosophy right we're a super-fast

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,780
project abby talked about that we

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,610
release frequently large amount of code

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,889
change constantly happening the

00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,620
architecture evolve zkk on stantly and

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:15,540
we'll talk a bit more about that there's

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,220
a lot of interoperability now that's

00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,950
kind of there's two different ways to

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,139
think about interoperability one of them

00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:26,370
is to say does it kind of conform to

00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,930
standards right does it does it use CNI

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,810
a container networking interface does it

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,120
use different standards that are

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,530
applicable to the architecture the other

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,990
way to think about it though is is it

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,490
able to be well integrated into the

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,550
traditional enterprise environment

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,800
because the way to think about software

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,200
or any technology that's been deployed

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,400
inside of a large enterprise is that

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,530
you're probably never going to turn it

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,940
off right so we need to be able to

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,330
integrate these things well well

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,860
together and the last is innovation

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,139
innovation is something that you know

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,510
you don't you don't design innovation

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,150
into a process I think what you do is

00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,710
you design the opportunity to take

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,250
advantage of moments of innovation that

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,900
occur so those are to me that's kind of

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,700
the three ethos is that the the

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,430
community of contributors community of

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,020
committers have across all of the

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,229
projects within the Cloud Foundry

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:22,160
foundation now the title of my talk is

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:24,060
building bridges not a literal way

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,660
everybody knows what this bridge is

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,130
right yeah the Golden Gate Bridge Golden

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,930
Gate Bridge is interesting for me I

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,210
don't live in the San Francisco area I

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,680
don't I live on the East Coast and so

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,990
I've I've kind of been learning the San

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,250
Francisco geography and it's an

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,160
interesting bridge for me because it

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,120
connects

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,120
two really different communities one of

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,560
them is the city of San Francisco and

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,650
then across the bridge is Marin County

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,080
and for you know quite some time there

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,100
was no connection between the two you

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,410
had to go all the way around this

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,810
enormous Bay to kind of get from one of

00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,700
these communities to the other but when

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,590
they agreed to build that bridge the

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,080
economy started to grow a bit more

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,590
between the two that's a powerful thing

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,760
connecting to different communities

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,090
now that applies to the open source

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,590
world as well we don't have to talk

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,680
about physical bridges we can talk about

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,880
metaphorical bridges we can talk about

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,210
collaboration amongst communities

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,190
amongst projects amongst teams and it's

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,070
something that is key to the Cloud

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:30,580
Foundry foundations community and how

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:33,010
we've evolved since 2015 and even before

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:36,670
that so here's a little bit of a history

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:39,430
lesson before the Cloud Foundry

00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:42,340
foundation existed I was not involved in

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,410
this project this community I think I

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,740
had written a service broker back in

00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,940
about you know early 2014 before you

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,660
could do asynchronous it was a little

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:56,050
difficult but I got involved and and

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,419
when I joined in 2015 there are a few

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,640
integrations that had already occurred

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,140
let's call them bridges one of them was

00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,180
that of course it was using Linux

00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,470
containers way back in 2011 remember

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:11,770
before docker even existed as a word

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:13,210
also 2014 the idea of being able to push

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,860
a docker image into the application

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,680
runtime or what we just called cloud

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,480
foundry back then was a key part of the

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,240
system we were starting to explore what

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,990
it meant to move beyond just the CF push

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,370
experience of code so fast-forward a

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,050
little bit let's let's talk about some

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:36,190
of the I guess the last two years worth

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:37,630
of bridges that have been built so for

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,060
those of you that that are familiar with

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:43,180
the open container initiative it was an

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,800
effort that was created inside the Linux

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,880
Foundation in order to try to

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,800
rationalize some of the tension in the

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,510
tech industry around Linux containers

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,970
between docker Koro

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,500
they're their rocket run time there were

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,180
debates about what process was gonna

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,910
start what process and who was in charge

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,430
of watching what pid' and so the open

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,440
container initiative was really about

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,790
hosting this core library called run see

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,750
which was at the heart of the docker

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:13,870
engine and also to create an image

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,730
specification so cloud foundry has the

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,000
distinction in the honor of being the

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,400
second platform to adopt run see after

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,530
dr. so we were basically the first ones

00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:27,190
to say you know what that's a great

00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:30,340
standard what's adopted fast-forward a

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,260
little further November 16 we start

00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,910
supporting the container networking

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,160
interface

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,450
this is an early standard but we

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,980
realized that yeah we're running

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,850
applications in containers and we need

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,930
to find ways to work with underlying

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,160
software-defined networking systems and

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,330
CNI seemed like the right approach

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,150
little further we spin out the open

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:54,070
service broker API open that up so that

00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,690
the kubernetes community or any other

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,640
community all the public cloud providers

00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,830
can begin to take advantage of that

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,040
abstraction that's been so powerful for

00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,540
cloud foundry over the years we open

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,150
that up and you've you've probably seen

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,190
demos of whether it's Microsoft showing

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,800
off their service broker and how you can

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,840
consume it from kubernetes using the

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,340
service catalog extension or whether you

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,280
can consume it from from cloud foundry

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,330
application runtime you know other

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,090
providers have also demoed similar

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:25,660
things it's become very powerful so that

00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,580
was a bridge that we built in May of 17

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,010
there was a project called Kubo that was

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:33,160
announced was a joint project between

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:34,750
vmware pivotal and google which was how

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,290
do we use the power of bosch to actually

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,430
deploy kubernetes manage it upgrade it

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,190
that became the Cloud Foundry container

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,690
runtime another bridge was built that

00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,280
was our first step as a community in

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,010
actually adopting or embracing

00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,470
kubernetes I'm gonna kind of go a little

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,880
bit faster through some of these but

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:55,420
we've done a lot of different things so

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,520
you're gonna see a demo from the project

00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,900
teams that are focused on the windows

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,490
technology stack the Microsoft

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,780
technology stack but one of the things

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,640
that they did was they worked on wincy

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,740
which is how do you take Runcie and

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,430
bring it to the Windows platform we also

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,180
have

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,680
already integrated envoy proxy sto

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,200
integrations currently being tested our

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,779
communities helping with use cases that

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:21,850
the sto ecosystem needs to understand

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:24,550
around scalability and then kubernetes

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,459
is starting to get a little hotter right

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,510
you saw two announcements yesterday ABI

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,220
talked a little bit about to the

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,260
incubating projects I'll I'll explain

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,270
them a little bit further in a few

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,800
minutes but you know clearly kubernetes

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,510
has become the standard for the

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,850
container abstraction right

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,920
infrastructure as Linux containers and

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,660
so it's really important that we

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,459
continue to explore different avenues

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:50,380
for integrating with working with and

00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:53,890
allowing cloud foundry to consume that

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:56,740
infrastructure a little further

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:59,260
container D integrations begun and then

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,570
more recently if you haven't seen the

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,890
news I think this is perhaps was a bit

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,990
underplayed I think it's perhaps one of

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,130
the biggest moments in the platform

00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,959
as-a-service space in quite some time

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,510
build packs which was originally an idea

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,740
from Heroku were incorporated into cloud

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,680
foundry they're part of the power of

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:20,500
that CF push experience that CF push

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,029
experience though started to diverge

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,089
from the Heroku experience it's we had

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:26,529
this forking of the build pack community

00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:29,830
with the cloud native build packs

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,570
project we're bringing Heroku and Cloud

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,730
Foundry ecosystems back together and

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,320
we're doing it in a way that's going to

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:40,570
allow the power of build packs to work

00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:42,730
in any OCI compatible platform now

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,500
that's an amazing combination and I say

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,810
we I'm talking about the broader cloud

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,370
Native community it's an amazing

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,990
combination to see happen it's a great

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,610
moment in time for those of us that

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:56,740
understand the power the platform is a

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:59,440
service model so we we do this though

00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,730
and I spend a lot of time in different

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,570
regions around the world I talked to

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,209
different enterprises

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,250
I talked to press I talked to analysts

00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:08,380
and there's always this there's kind of

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,680
this this nudge they want to give you

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,060
hey there's a new project why haven't

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,290
you incorporated that yet then I'm

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,459
talking to the analysts and press right

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:21,509
down here right you should already have

00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:26,679
it done I said well you know what

00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:29,079
let me explain it's a balancing act we

00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:31,119
have enormous corporations that run

00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:34,300
their payment processing systems on the

00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:35,709
cloud foundry platform we have so many

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,410
different businesses that have chosen

00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:40,480
the the platform and the technology to

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,279
help reinvent their business to to build

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,230
the new version of their business on top

00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,379
of that they expect this to be an

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,420
evolution not a gut-wrenching revolution

00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:51,610
every time there's a new capability or a

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,970
new project that starts in the in the

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,920
broader open source community so what

00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,209
our committers have done what our

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,160
contributors have done is they've been

00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:02,709
very thoughtful about that balancing act

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,600
between we need to we need to embrace

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,610
innovation from throughout the ecosystem

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,279
but on the other hand we need to do it

00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,290
carefully right I'm going to mention sto

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,119
earlier but it's a good example it's an

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,639
amazing project has some amazing ideas

00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:18,040
behind it but we need to do a couple

00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,269
things one figure out what that

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,459
developer experience is going to look

00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:24,220
like because it can't be the raw SEO

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:25,420
experience the second is that it

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,769
actually needs to be mature enough that

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,679
we can run it in production at a large

00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:32,230
scale and so our community needs to lean

00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,309
in there and help so that's the

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,829
balancing act that we're constantly

00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:37,679
struggling with right on one side is the

00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:40,029
hey new and shiny and the other is

00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,429
responsibility for all of you that

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:44,649
actually use the software and I think we

00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:46,209
do it particularly well now there's a

00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:48,279
book that talks about some of this

00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:50,230
innovators dilemma most of you have

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,279
probably at least heard of it if you

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,920
haven't read it yourselves and

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,689
frequently people discuss the dilemma

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,119
its itself which is you know you get

00:14:55,689 --> 00:15:00,220
stuck you don't want to change and the

00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:01,899
dilemma is a very hard dilemma but play

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,929
them Christmas in the author he actually

00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:07,899
offered the answer to this dilemma which

00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:11,769
is that you don't focus on making a plan

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:14,559
you focus on learning right the more you

00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:16,449
can be a learning team or in our case a

00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:19,059
learning community the more exploration

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,439
that you can have the more likely it is

00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:22,689
that you can continue to evolve

00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:24,610
successfully and respond to changes in

00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,899
your environment and we do that

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,589
particularly well and I think we embody

00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:30,490
that as a community we do that you know

00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,829
through through lots of different

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,150
methods right we have our extensions

00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:36,970
projects we have lots of

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:39,040
in experiments these these happen maybe

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,140
is a formal effort or sometimes we just

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,670
have a pair of developers that we're

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,920
working on let's say the cloud

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,230
controller that step aside and they they

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,690
spike out an idea and that happens all

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,560
the time but we also have a much broader

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:55,150
ecosystem that we're part of all of the

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,710
interesting projects that exist across

00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:00,460
this ecosystem represent opportunities

00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:03,040
for the Cloud Foundry community to draw

00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,930
in innovation to make sure that it's

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,640
ready and well integrated and then to

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,620
provide that through all the downstream

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,810
distributions and all the end to all the

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,990
end users it's a pretty powerful model

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:16,150
and it really does require that all of

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,560
the committers or the maintainer zin

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,590
there and the project leads spend a lot

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,650
of time listening to users so for those

00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:27,220
of you that are users I have a request

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:29,650
if you don't spend time talking to the

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:34,030
project teams talking to the project

00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:37,600
leads please do because they love to get

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:39,310
information from users it's critical now

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,870
if you're buying it from a vendor buying

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,630
some Cloud Foundry technology from a

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,370
vendor absolutely have conversations

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,930
with the vendor but get involved in the

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,370
upstream and you could do that simply by

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,960
paying attention to new feature

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,710
proposals and giving us your real

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:57,460
opinions anybody know where this is I

00:16:53,710 --> 00:17:00,820
guess is a difficult QA spot right

00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,810
lissa grata Familia in Barcelona I love

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,390
this picture because it's a shot

00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:07,630
straight up into one of the craziest

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,180
cathedrals on the planet the reason why

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,670
I have this photo up here is that

00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,230
there's there's a saying an open source

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,880
it goes way back to the beginning of the

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,400
open source movement that was you know

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,880
there's the Cathedral which is the world

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,030
of proprietary and the bazaar which is

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,120
the world of open source and it's kind

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:30,520
of set up by the the originator as a bit

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,020
of a choice you have to choose the

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,470
cathedral route for proprietary software

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,910
or you could choose the bazaar route and

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,300
the bazaar routes gonna have a lot of

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,280
innovation and be crazy and exciting I

00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,700
think actually the you can combine the

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,529
two you can be thoughtful about what

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,690
becomes

00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:50,399
ready for production which released

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,529
collect to the collective at the same

00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:55,080
time that you can allow for innovation

00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:58,110
that you can allow for experiments that

00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,970
you can allow for the larger open source

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,250
ecosystem to provide you with

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,440
inspiration and that's what we try to do

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,320
and I think that listed rata familia is

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,139
a great example of some crazy ideas

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:14,330
coming together in a way that also

00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:16,500
becomes a cathedral so we do this

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,409
thinking about different personas

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,000
generally and if you talk to anyone who

00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:23,460
helps build the Cloud Foundry software

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,190
they're really thinking about two

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,169
different types of people and maybe I'm

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,850
oversimplifying it but that's okay I'm

00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:32,100
on the stage there not right now so I'm

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:35,190
gonna oversimplify you have application

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,929
developers who build applications and I

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,570
also include what I call application

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,399
operators the people that get software

00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,830
from someone else like an ISV

00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:45,240
and have to deploy and manage it because

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,059
there are some similar in highly

00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,580
overlapping use cases there on the other

00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:51,720
side we have platform operators these

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,070
are the people that actually deploy

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,870
manage the platform now if you're using

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,809
cloud foundry from a managed service

00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,250
provider those teams work for that but

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:01,529
they both matter and they both matter

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:05,490
quite a bit to our community of

00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:09,480
contributors and developers the other

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:12,210
thing that is really really apparent is

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,980
that if you haven't already figured this

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,610
out we live in a multi abstraction world

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,500
right VM serve use cases containers a

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,330
service or kubernetes serves a use case

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,980
platform as-a-service is exceptionally

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,649
valuable we're starting to see a lot

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,289
more function as a service this is the

00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:30,330
world that our users live in and there

00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:33,750
are some problems that have to be solved

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:36,929
because of all of these platforms all of

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:39,240
these abstractions and last year we did

00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:42,179
a survey of the cloud foundry users it's

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,100
an imperfect it's a user survey but it

00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,750
was clear that the overwhelming

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,700
percentage overwhelming majority of

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,590
cloud foundry users were either already

00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,279
saying yeah I want the cloud foundry

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:57,210
paas and I either already have or want

00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,169
to use kubernetes with it now there's

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,179
lots of different ways that we could

00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:01,440
stack these two technologies but the fat

00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,820
that we want to integrate them I think

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,690
is particularly important now today were

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,220
actually last year on this stage we had

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,529
integrated the Cloud Foundry container

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,119
runtime or the Kubo project into the

00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,889
foundation we announced it we do we said

00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,619
hey this this is important this is the

00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:21,690
first embrace of kubernetes it's how you

00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:23,220
can deploy and manage kubernetes it's

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,840
been now commercialized by pivotal

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,450
VMware I think Swisscom is now

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,860
commercializing it so great progress

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,529
there it continues to evolve that

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,059
project continues to support each new

00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:35,639
version of kubernetes as it comes out

00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,559
provide zero downtime upgrades of it I

00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:40,139
became a certified distribution as a

00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,679
open source distribution of kubernetes

00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:45,529
and it became a pretty powerful tool

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,730
that our community has available to it

00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:49,649
but there's other ways that you can

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,190
think about stacking the architecture

00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:54,990
and so when Abbie talked about some of

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,289
the new projects that's really what

00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,879
we're referring to so if we focus on

00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:02,940
that application runtime the CF push

00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:05,340
experience inside of it there there is a

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,580
container scheduler now one of the

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,320
options that has now been opened up or

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,570
that's going to be opened up as the

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,429
arena project evolves is to have the

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,610
option to use kubernetes as the

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:21,269
underlying container scheduler that's

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:24,480
what that project is all about we also

00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:27,059
have this powerful tool called Bosh does

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,679
amazing things and then we've got

00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:32,100
kubernetes and we talked about how Bosh

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,629
can deploy kubernetes but maybe we could

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,249
take some of the software that's being

00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:39,360
developed with Bosh deployment in mind

00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:41,159
run it through a process of container

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,429
izing it and deployed into kubernetes

00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:46,049
using docker images in helm that's what

00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:50,129
the CF containerization project is all

00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:52,619
about it takes release manifests builds

00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:59,519
docker images helm charts and deploys it

00:21:52,619 --> 00:22:02,399
into coop but I focus on developers

00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,740
predominantly there who I think about

00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:06,210
most frequently the you know those two

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,519
projects really are they're very

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,169
interesting they're very important but

00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,109
they're predominantly for either the

00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:13,720
platform operator or the vendor that's

00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:15,460
packaging

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,900
product because it has to do with how

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,350
you want to stack these different

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:23,610
technologies and as long as both the

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,710
platform as a service and the kubernetes

00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:29,500
experience are both exposed that's a

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:32,190
really powerful combination and so the

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,510
developers were application operators

00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:37,260
what they want is they want to see this

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,640
be particularly well integrated and

00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,810
there are a lot of efforts that aren't

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,280
being announced because they're just

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,320
simply efforts that are occurring within

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,760
existing projects that are dealing with

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,200
the question of can we do shared

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,570
networking all right that's the sort of

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,760
the sto initial sto integration if we

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,560
get sto integrated that starts to work

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,530
then there's a next step which would be

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,150
to say okay let's get a studio running

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,070
on the kubernetes side and let's make

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,710
sure that we're sharing policy and

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:04,210
traffic and flow but also there's

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,730
synchronized Service Catalog which we

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,100
saw a demo yesterday on this stage the

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,780
purply project that s AP introduced and

00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,120
has gotten a lot of industry support

00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,160
around is all about synchronizing

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,590
service catalogs not just having a

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,270
shared spec for how backing services are

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,620
communicated with but actually having

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,090
the same Service Catalog and same

00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,790
awareness of different services that

00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,290
have been initiated aggregate telemetry

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,930
right logging and metrics pipelines

00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,790
common identity these are all really

00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,110
basic things but our community is

00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,790
digging into them and they're taking the

00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,560
right steps the right initial steps and

00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,360
the right future steps to be able to

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,770
provide that consistent experience for a

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,450
developer that wants to work with the

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,030
two different abstractions together I

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:48,460
think that's really important to the

00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:53,920
whole industry so I you saw this slide

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:56,470
yesterday from ab Abby this is just a

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,540
sampling of some of the today some of

00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:01,660
the projects that are embedded inside of

00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:05,350
the Cloud Foundry platform or collection

00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:07,090
of technologies they represent some of

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,700
the most interesting projects that exist

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,500
in the cloud native landscape today but

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,570
in the end they're kind of components of

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,210
a bigger system that needs to be built

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:21,610
and that bigger system is what Cloud

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:25,210
Foundry is providing so I like to say

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:27,340
that we're we're on a journey as an

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,660
ecosystem as a community

00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,620
we've been on that journey for a number

00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:35,620
of years new projects are going to show

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:38,650
up we need to embrace them when they're

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,840
useful we need to integrate them when

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:43,480
they're ready and we need to help get

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,190
them ready that's our responsibility as

00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,720
users as contributors and it's

00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,240
committers in the Cloud Foundry

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,030
ecosystem let's take this journey

00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,920
together and really focus on building

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:57,130
bridges between different parts of this

00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,540
broader ecosystem because that's how the

00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:01,300
end users in the end get the most

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,610
benefit that's how we get to take

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:06,010
advantage of the innovation across this

00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:10,410
broader landscape and that's how I think

00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:13,150
we get to really continue to evolve and

00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:15,670
solve the problem that the CF community

00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:18,940
has been so focused on solving making it

00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:23,290
easy for businesses and other

00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:25,090
organizations to be good at software so

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,560
with that I want to say thank you very

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,890
much

00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,890
[Applause]

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:40,480
yesterday Abby walked through a couple

00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:43,000
of bits and news there were some really

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,370
fascinating stuff but a few more bits

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,800
and news so I'm going to go through a

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,240
couple of items and so the first is a

00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,920
couple years ago we launched our

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,800
developer training and certification

00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,170
program we've been blessed by being able

00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:59,320
to be involved with about 17,000 people

00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,150
worldwide so far very proud of that lots

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,210
of Education happening out in the market

00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,650
and this doesn't include all the amazing

00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,180
training programs that a lot of the

00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,160
systems integrators and and other

00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,690
providers are actually doing on a

00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,100
regular basis this is just purely the

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:17,050
the foundation's ability to touch people

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,520
and so that's grown really well but

00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,800
pivotal announced and it was in the

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,570

00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,340
work that we as well as some of the

00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,960
systems integrators and the volunteers

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,360
that have helped produce this content

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,000
pivotal will be adopting that as come

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,430

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,110

00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,150

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:44,410
educational materials so we want to

00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:46,600

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:54,430

00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,690

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,030
of some sort right I do okay

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,800

00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:48,910

00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,740
awesome okay so yeah cloud booster maybe

00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:54,730
some of you already had the pleasure of

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:57,340
having a cloud booster vanilla latte at

00:27:54,730 --> 00:28:01,480
booth number 15 so the announcement is

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:03,940
that from yesterday technically grape up

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,940
is offering its own distribution of

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:10,120
Cloud Foundry in the form of cloud

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:13,090
booster so cloud booster is an open

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:16,180
cloud platform that allows enterprise

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:18,910
companies to build run operate any

00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:22,720
workload in the cloud that that's our

00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:26,080
ambition so our goal is to help midsize

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,350
companies embrace open source technology

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,840
and have a curated experience and be

00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:34,210

supporting cloud native software as you

00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:45,040
can see here we've integrated leading

00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:47,530
open source technologies and fuse them

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,940
together with what we call cloud booster

00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:55,530
glue to have a platform that will be

00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:58,330
able to run twelve factor applications

00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,370
cots software and and so on and so on

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,840
