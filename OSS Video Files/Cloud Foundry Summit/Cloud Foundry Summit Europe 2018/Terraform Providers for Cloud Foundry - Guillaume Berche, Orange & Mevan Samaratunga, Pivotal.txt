	Terraform Providers for Cloud Foundry - Guillaume Berche, Orange & Mevan Samaratunga, Pivotal

As a Cloud Foundry admin, do you feel tired of scripting the CF CLI to automate provisioning of CF resources (domain/org/roles/quotas/buildpacks/sec-groups/brokers/service-plan-visibility etc...)? Is your automation getting complex and fragile as your CF ecosystem scales ?

As a CF application developer, do you sometimes feel limited by the CF application manifest ? Ever needed to script creation of space/role/service instance/network-policy ? Would you like to manage your application resources in an idempotent manner, uniformly across CF CR and CF AR, and cross-reference them ?

Terraform (https://www.terraform.io/) “enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve your production infrastructure. It is an open source tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.”

This talk introduces terraform providers for CF-related resources, bringing terraform benefits to CF admins and developers. It starts by detailing some target use-cases, then illustrates use of terraform CF provider through demos, details the current state of the implementation available at https://github.com/mevansam/terraform-provider-cf, and closes with future plans and perspectives on innovative use-cases.
