Description: 
	Implementing Multi-AZ, HA, nZDM Stateful BOSH Based Service Broker on AWS, Azure, GCP and OpenStack - Ketaki Gadre & Shashank Mohan Jain, SAP

In the words of Jonas Boner "There is no such thing as a stateless architecture It's just someone else's problem". While a stateless broker can be easily made HA by using a load balancer it is the stateful once which are challenging. Service Brokers are critical for PaaS providers and a downtime has a potential to create outages. A line of defense can be BOSH resurrection however it takes minutes to bring up all the various processes for example a Stemcell update may take around 5-10 minutes. And this is unacceptable by any standards where the expectation is to be 99.99% available.

In this talk Ashish and Shashank will share how Service Fabrik broker from Cloud Foundry community has been implemented as a highly available, disaster resistant with failover time of few seconds. In this talk implementation specifics on AWS, Azure, GCP and OpenStack platforms will be covered followed a by a demo on one of the IaaS.
