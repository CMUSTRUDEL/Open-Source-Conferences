Title: Sky is the Limit for Cloud Foundry at AirFrance-KLM
Publication date: 2018-10-11
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2018
Description: 
	Sky is the Limit for Cloud Foundry at AirFrance-KLM - Nathan Wattimena & Fabien Lebrere, AirFrance-KLM

AFKLM has mandate to setup large innovative solutions to support AF & KLM. It covers platform think, build and run both as several instantiations while keeping homogeneity and reducing costs and snowflakes.

As part of a global cloud native transformation across AFKLM, businesses and IT teams - Kaps4Biz was launched and encompasses topics from CI/CD developer ecosystem tools to actual containers and cloud native platform.

Adopting Cloud Foundry as a part of it immediately made sense - as long as the underlying larger strategic streams could be mapped for the long term:
- developer onboarding and project facilitation for several thousands of them
- rich catalog of service with a mix of build, buy & integrate strategy
- operational excellence for keeping the platform and apps running at scale on private cloud
- vendor neutrality and skill center development
- innovation acceleration for cloud native, microservices and container-first architecture
- simple rollout of a reference architecture at global scale

Come hear about our journey to start and measure success in transforming AFKLM how we leveraged and expanded the specifics of Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Pivotal DOJOs implementation approach and the Cloud Foundry partner ecosystem to rollout a new way of working for developers & operators at AFKLM.

I'm I'm Nathan what Tamara I'm the I'm

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,780
Nathan what man I'm the product owner

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:19,410
for for the joint Cloud Foundry team and

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:22,580
as just like a lot of people today we're

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,980
here to tell you about our journey on

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,590
implementing Cloud Foundry so a little

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,780
bit about myself I've been working at at

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,340
KLM in ops for about ten years and for

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,739
the past year I've been involved with

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,140
the team that implements Cloud Foundry

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,210
within air france-klm and with me is

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:50,160
Fabiana grads who I'm working in a false

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,809
I am a deaf guy so not all sorry and I'm

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,239
working the stuff to engineering and

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,899
phone at all I was a dev representatives

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,360
who I represent

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,770
order a France and Karen and I'm working

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,930
in a France since than 1999 and so we

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:11,070
have built a solution together a France

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:14,100
Karen we're at Air France Kailyn what do

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,930
we do we fly planes right that's our

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,420
main main main business but now we're in

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,930
a world that is so fast changing and

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,030
moving and we're not competing but also

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,140
working together with other businesses

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,880
that that implements technology in the

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,479
current world which is moving too fast

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,790
for us so we have to change our our

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:44,700
world and change our game and we have to

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:46,619
move to digitalization so here I stole

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,659
this from a business presentation or air

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,720
france-klm by the way so it just shows

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,750
that all the move all the world around

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,060
air france-klm is is different we have

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,340
to compete with other businesses for the

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,630
same market share so air france-klm has

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,750
decided to to focus more on

00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:12,480
digitalization and software also to

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,709
reduce technical depth that we might

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,909
have

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:20,700
move along with the rest of the world so

00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:27,870
let me go back a few years back before I

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:29,940
was the owner of this team so compared

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,220
to the previous presentation so we

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,360
started with with a club boundary open

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,250
source I think is about two years ago we

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,950
started to do investigation on that but

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:45,780
we were really really struggling with

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:49,500
with the team with the skill level we

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,379
had a lot of team members changing it

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,359
was not a good understanding of the

00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:56,099
technology itself it was it was

00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:59,459
difficult so there was also a change in

00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:02,010
skill levels every time we had really

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,920
hard time to get it production ready to

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:08,489
get the organization around us to trust

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,220
us to to get it into production there

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:14,129
was a no alignment at all with with

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:18,989
business apps only used for prototyping

00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:22,620
only it was it was really hard and so

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:26,010
the management they they saw the need in

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,359
moving always changing world they saw

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:31,260
the need that we really need to do

00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:35,190
something so we really need to to get it

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,150
moving and we decided to to go for the

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,549
pivotal pivotal solution which are the

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:46,919
the the rockstars in this business

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:49,199
actually at this moment so yeah why

00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,120
pivotal yeah it's it's not a pivotal

00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,150
pitch of course but I just want to

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,280
mention that what pivotal it's a yeah

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,379
they had a lot of experience there their

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,019
main contributors to the open source

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:03,750
program of course and they had a lot of

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:06,569
experience in implementing cloud foundry

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:10,739
their pivotal cloud foundry into

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:13,560
enterprises a lot of experience also

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,919
they they came at the the pivotal cloud

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,500
foundry product comes with a lot of -

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,229
links and an automation - to make your

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,830
life easier so looking at the skill set

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:27,400
which in

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,289
team so the things that really need we

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,530
really could use the things that the

00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:38,169
filter car foundry brought into our into

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:40,930
our lives into our organization and they

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:43,840
can also deliver the the productive

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,780
support whenever there is a big problem

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,110
or fragment might come up they are

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,990
willing to support us all the way but

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,780
what I really want to mention is about

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,090
all these innovative stuff in people

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,039
across family itself is very it's great

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,110
it's awesome all the tooling is great

00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:05,080
it's making our life easier awesome and

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,030
PS whatever it's really great but what I

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,930
appreciate the most is the involvement

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:13,210
of the team itself so involvement of

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:16,539
everyone here and they're helping our my

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:19,180
team in in in all aspects not only

00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:22,379
technical aspects but also in for me as

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:26,680
a part owner in my product management

00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,060
roles and tasks and his involvement or

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,029
the involvement of pivotal itself not

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,039
only everyone it's um their involvement

00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:35,830
within the organization is really what

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:40,960
makes it real good partner for us to

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:43,539
work with so our platform journey

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,129
started with of course the dojo

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:53,169
everybody knows about the dojo yeah

00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:55,419
there the concept of I do it and then

00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:59,379
you do it or we do it together and then

00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:03,759
you do it it's yeah focus on enablement

00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:05,860
it but to be honest there are lean

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,409
disciplines and and and and everything

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,650
as a core core principles of enablement

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:15,819
and the way of working to be honest it

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:20,229
was very hard for us very hard we're not

00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:27,639
used in pairing we're not used to do I

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:29,830
know through real agile methodologies we

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,740
did a geometry methodologies right so we

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,650
did our stand-ups we we try to implement

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,710
scrum so we did we did our stuff but

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,860
those those dojo period we stretch it

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,320
and to eight weeks in there instead of

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,940
six it was really hard for us for me

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,910
personally I got our get really stressed

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,889
but they try to learn learn us something

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:55,540
something more than just installing

00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:58,419
things installing PCF they try to teach

00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,850
us discipline they try the really core

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:03,669
principles that focus on enablement and

00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:08,260
not just push next next next and then

00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:11,139
it's it's done and it's always in a

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,229
customer centric position from a

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:17,020
customer's centric solution is always to

00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,760
deliver value to your customer but we're

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,120
not used to that we're not used to have

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,639
to talk to first to every user and get

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,050
their opinions and and whatever before

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,620
we implement something so it's something

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,930
that we need to learn and the things the

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,080
core principles of build and measure and

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:37,930
learn we really had to to get used to

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,240
that instead of just oh we're engineers

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:44,860
so we know how what to build and we just

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:49,510
just move forward so something that we

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:55,530
need to learn also and there from day

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:59,470
one there their focus was to automate it

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:02,229
please automate it and our deliverable

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,870
was not really big compared to the

00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:07,840
previous presentation of 26 foundations

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,729
but we only had to have seven

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,320
foundations but they start at the

00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:14,260
beginning yeah but we if we install it

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,760
manually I'm done in one day it's if you

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,940
have to build a pipeline a fuller in

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,400
concourse it's such a pain for us the

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,919
learning curve is too high but no they

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,620
really teach us now focus on automating

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,900
it so we started with with with

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,620
concourse building a pipeline not me

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:35,589
personally but my team is here so they

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:40,659
started doing that so we really needed

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:42,459
to hit a lot but because it really

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,050
helped us because after the first

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:47,200
pipeline just creating their first

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,130
install it is easy to push it to the

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,589
next

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,149
next foundation or next environment and

00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,220
after that you can build upon the

00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:57,370
pipeline to do other things and just

00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,420
install I don't know where now I think

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:05,889
at the point that we do the the small

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,870
patches automated so we did it anyway

00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:09,310
so thank you for teaching us that and

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,560
thank you for the team that that

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,259
implements that I'm I'm really proud of

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,690
my of my team that we were able to do

00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:19,420
that you might wonder why I say seven

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:23,139
wonders platform I will come back to

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:25,779
that later but seven wonders is

00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:29,889
basically a board game it's a strategic

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:33,009
board game compared to Age of Empires I

00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:36,160
know if the old guys are there that used

00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:40,630
to go play those games that's basically

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,910
it's it's you have to gather resources

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:47,290
and gather all the things before you can

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:49,269
create a society basically and then run

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,790
from there so this is this is what we

00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:54,850
have done this part of our journey we

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:58,899
had all the small things get our people

00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:03,360
get our resources order servers and

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:07,329
whatever to get where we are right now

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:12,759
but to be in air france-klm it means

00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:16,029
it's that we're not able to to work

00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:21,880
independently as an island basically and

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:24,490
we had to integrate with a lot of the

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:28,180
current systems within air france-klm so

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:32,220
things like monitoring tools for

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,220
troubleshooting metrics logging

00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:41,199
fortification methods it's um

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:43,089
so we try to do that it's it's really

00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:45,850
difficult because in an organization as

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,250
a foreign calum all things this is

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,959
managed by different departments so

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,060
again we had to start talking with them

00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:56,050
so we should contact them and then start

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:59,980
to get all those things going again a

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,660
real pain for us really heavy but again

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,310
we managed to inter

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:11,800
with with a lot of the existing systems

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:14,050
and tools like we managed to get

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,210
Interscope working to get the metrics

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:22,150
from applications we are able to send

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:24,310
the logging to an aggregated log system

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:29,940
within air france-klm which is managed

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:33,660
by a different team and we had to have

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:36,730
access to the platform itself to PS and

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:40,390
we basically had to go to an

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:45,220
authentication method which is with an

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:47,590
air france-klm so now we have integrated

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,560
with that and all the users first from

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:52,930
we moved from creating local users now

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,060
we use ping federate to connect to the

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:59,250
through platform so you get

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,250
authenticated on a platform directly

00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:06,610
here's a small picture of seven wonders

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:11,260
the board game so we started really from

00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:14,050
zero from from nothing basically with

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:17,020
hope with the OpenStack I mean open

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,650
source a cloud foundry but this journey

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:24,520
of pivot our file we start with nothing

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:26,950
but with support of my product manager

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,960
and everything in within air france-klm

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:33,490
all the different departments also we

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,900
started to get this project going we get

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,780
physical servers across three data

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,670
centers and after the six weeks of dojo

00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,670
we have installed seven foundations

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:45,550
across three data centers which is

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:48,040
basically also after the dojo period

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:51,220
which is with ended in the end of March

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,730
beginning April we were operational and

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:59,830
we were live it's um it's an on-prem

00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:02,320
solution with on on vSphere its

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,210
production great a dual side design

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:10,000
according to the reference architecture

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:12,580
of of pivotal with an availability zones

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,840
three available tones availability zones

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:19,270
design

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,920
so for a che purposes and we try to

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,500
implement as much as possible to

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:34,320
reference architecture so we are

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:35,880
future-proof also for for monitoring and

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,860
alerting

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:43,660
we have to integrate with with the

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:45,160
current solution at a france-klm so we

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,990
could try to combine some stuff which is

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,520
already within PCF a stoker foundry and

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,310
this is an example how we integrate it

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,310
with the the alerting mechanism of used

00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:02,460
by air france-klm which is Centurion so

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:06,940
we we implemented healthwatch as as

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:10,420
platform monitoring and talking with the

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:14,260
teams of monitoring team we came to a

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:17,020
system that can send the the metrics

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,610
from HealthWatch to Prometheus and from

00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,589
there on they created a bridge to

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,760
Centurion and then and now we have also

00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:26,760
alerting mechanism for our platform but

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:35,290
this is just one of the integrations

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:37,750
examples that that we did but as I

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:42,600
already mentioned who are we doing it

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:46,200
for my main client is the developer

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,930
themselves so where to the developer

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,610
thanks nothing maybe just before to

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,570
continue a small question

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:58,150
ooh is know whom is not a developer

00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:02,890
piecewise you want not much

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:05,650
sure okay have you already asked to a

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,190
developer what is this dream what is it

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,010
want

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,370
are you done with the job already no

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,540
never

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,420
ok because in fact for the repair or is

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,420
simple we are in the business world so

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,490
in english is most clear beer I think

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,940
you know the theory

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,560
yes yes because for you

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,060
sometimes the developer yes

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,460
dream is the remain Rimmer hood in fact

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,520
what he wants a developer is simple he

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:40,390
want to code code that cut with zero

00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:44,200
cash if you want coding but database you

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:47,920
want the middleware he want and he

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,230
wanted to deploy autumn honestly this

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,380
application with that any problem of

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,760
course I have a new language I want to

00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:01,150
use it because it's fun

00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:04,560
yes do you know cut link go yeah very

00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,190
fine languages but of course

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,390
infrastructure area

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:13,810
not from paperwork not if I need to plan

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:17,279
ahead this server with our IP runs no I

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:21,490
don't want to touch no no no instead VM

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,290
operating system no no and of course for

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,240
me

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,279
we have degree with a nice platform and

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,160
of course I his backup well you asked me

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,270
the question I want to know why that's

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,800
more important

00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:38,589
yes I have design my application and of

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:45,550
course if something fails in life please

00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:51,100
don't cut yeah okay so it's still a

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:54,100
dream of course and we tried maybe we

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,530
try to say okay with dream we want it is

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,600
possible to implement it so we have

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,400
started to correct requirements we have

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,350
done some interviews survey to the

00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,660
developers to the replica application

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:07,530
operation and at the end we have

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:10,270
qualified more 100k requirements of

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,850
course if I push all requirements I said

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,829
to not be pleased to Mogu I have this

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:18,310
platform was little bit difficult for

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:21,970
him so we define a subset only 34

00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:24,850
requirements so to start we have called

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,980
these requirements MVP in among value

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:29,980
product web a real prove a you for the

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,400
developer most of them concerns the core

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,080
feature

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,840
yes we need to have something to install

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,000
is little bit difficult birth good pre

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,440
value for us is a service broker so we

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,810
have just put in the bucket

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:45,340
- yes - yeah

00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,920
after that you say okay now we have the

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:51,220
platform so we want to enrich him so we

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:54,790
are started to define a new subset 20

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,800
and most of them as based on extend the

00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:05,110
service catalog and we want to add 10

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:07,300
more yes I know so today we are here and

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,280
of course the goal is continued to

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,280
enrich the platform and to have a big

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,580
service catalog if I come back to the

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,970
first time VP so in a France column we

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:22,570
have a services already provided by our

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:24,580
operation and we have food the focus

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:28,060
only on - there are in green path curry

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:34,570
and Reedus so when I want to deploy my

00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:38,950
NASA application okay I have a nice cell

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:44,640
services I click and instant directly I

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:48,370
have my progress 12 of sorry sorry I

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,430
have my and spent on the fly I have my

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,260
progress SQL databases but of course my

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,230
application is so simple I need other

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:59,140
services and for that unfortunately I

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:02,950
need to add is there's a legacy way so

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,670
mail is you think like that just to

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,260
illustrate for example we wanted mangu

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,270
so we raised the question to a parish

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:13,750
and hey I want two databases for my

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:17,710
application and okay's I say ok for them

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:20,800
will you live in 4 weeks but I wanted

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:24,520
another one for acceptance no yes or no

00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,720
is enough there is not enough and they

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,170
say no problem

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:32,730
one in one weak moment but I want to

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:34,540
derive - yes no problem one week more

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,660
okay so six weeks

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,930
what for for life so of course as

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:45,880
developer what I want I won't have my or

00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:47,650
services in cell service mode so focus I

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:52,320
click and I am very happy

00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:54,570
absolutely but with now with

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,250
we want a blade services so we want to

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,440
provide some time we want to get

00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,940
services the benefit of the cloud so

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,700
there is a nice feature on the cloud so

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:07,830
of course if I can just click in plot

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:11,070
only and get it yes very fun I like the

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,570
word services services and of course so

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,670
if you are more technical you know that

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,760
is all based on open-source Bacchanalia

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:21,200
so okay now I have a lot of services so

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,810
it's great but now what we need to do

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,370
transitive or so to translate properly

00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,460
at the beginning when you start it we

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:31,770
say ok we need to define a training one

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,980
day and explain to the dear pod to use a

00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:37,170
platform yes of course but when we

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:41,420
discover the platen we say I in fact

00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:47,490
we're just to say CF push and is done Oh

00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:49,500
too simple so we say ok we are going to

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,670
do some cookbooks some guideline and

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:57,120
maybe we'll be enough to start yes right

00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:59,760
but if I wants to use release benefit of

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,890
the path off is not enough for example

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,660
if don't want to use micro services if I

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,030
want to use preamble with all the

00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,740
feature inside yes we need to do more

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,990
and for that instead of to do

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,180
traditional training we say ok we are

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:15,510
going to do I have carrot develop

00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:19,550
elements and push information by user

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:22,980
communities and for that thanks to

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:24,830
pivotal because I have a nice adventure

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:29,160
instance I said for example Jakob Jakob

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:33,090
sorry and very good guy about

00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:37,070
micro-services and when he went to your

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:41,730
company and explained develop our very

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:44,970
very very I don't know why that variable

00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,970
so of course as said by a ton we have

00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:50,460
three data centers so just done only one

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,820
but I've done one invert one and also

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,760
won two rows and another one in

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,560
Amsterdam so free time who is the big

00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,490
analyst in my forest I'm 40 what I so

00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,340
thank you very much

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,480
I won in Paris or so

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,520
organized yeah Moff is there so little

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,830
bit context letter communication is very

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,150
good and the investment would get very

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:15,980
benefit so okay we have 20 people but

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:19,130
now we have existing application I think

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,710
is your case too and we want to do the

00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,340
qualification this time I think not

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:27,740
exist but we have more 1000 applications

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,990
today and when you go to some conference

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,030
where they say hey you need to be clan

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:36,010
achieve you need to follow the 20 factor

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:38,240
everybody knows the 12 factorial yes

00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:43,100
little bit compress when you do me crazy

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,050
enough you need to follow that if you

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,120
are not aware about this you had

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,980
proposed to you to follow one of the

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,910
station raise back don't buy a Cassie

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,100
West I just pick one two years ago and

00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:57,470
it's very fine because I say okay there

00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,940
is pattern and the pattern to 30 minute

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,940
times I think we learn very well that

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,550
well factor I propose to focus on the

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:09,500
process part what is the auntie pattern

00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:12,800
of the process no auntie pattern is an

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:16,000
effete no NFS no networ fact storage of

00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,730
course but just keep in mind one thing

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,270
all new application are not Facebook or

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:26,390
Twitter

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:28,430
yeah so to explain a little bit more so

00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:31,340
I have a nice application stateless so

00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:35,120
no problem free application free

00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:38,540
instances nice I need to store storage

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,720
so for that of course objects to write

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,510
and by visually creating a very nice

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:49,060
application my customer can be worldwide

00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:52,100
I can have 1 billion of users perfect

00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:54,860
but one thing to pick in mind we are

00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,170
doing Malaysia if we are doing that yes

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:02,270
is nice virtual my question cost

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:03,680
increase a lot maybe in this case why

00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:07,250
not to stay on NFS

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:10,600
yes of course you are not going towards

00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:13,520
the right wide but on bit we application

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:17,090
your company your staff

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,530
maybe is enough and by this way the

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:24,730
reduce occurs the cost of the

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:29,450
immigration agree yeah nice

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:31,250
so people turns just on that and for

00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,610
that they say okay there is at wat phou

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,320
kham 2009 in and but is another hand we

00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:40,400
are going to create a new savage broker

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,380
so volume services and baby see what

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,350
just check in the marketplace its

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:49,100
existing create their services very

00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:51,490
easily and in fact just to bind my

00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,860
application so okay it's not well factor

00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:57,470
but for immigration can be enough just

00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:00,680
maybe one message more is keep in mind

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:06,320
in fact there is 12 factor that to use

00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:07,960
platform 3 for our only mandatory thank

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,380
you

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,720
nothing right

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,960
so our journey we're still on that

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,990
journey by the way we're not as far as

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,030
I'm concerned we're not there yet but

00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,860
that's basically the next slide in the

00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,390
challenges that we have right now the

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:33,470
challenges for the team the challenges

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:35,330
for the the organization itself is one

00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:39,170
of the biggest challenge that we come

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:46,490
across during this one year journey is

00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:49,700
that we I think from we are one

00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:52,790
organization starting in 2004 and we're

00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,740
now in 2018 but do you think that all

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:58,100
press processes are aligned are we using

00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:03,410
the same tooling no not at all

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:08,930
so we've been yeah you do the math 14 14

00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:12,350
years later so it's some of the things

00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:13,670
look similar but a lot of things are are

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,560
so different

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,210
the teams are different the mentality is

00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,850
different organization air france-klm

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:23,940
but not even air france-klm within KLM

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:25,840
itself the way how Department works

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,030
supporting departments that we are

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,790
depending on they use different

00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:32,830
processes the one department wants you

00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:37,360
to use JIRA to get requests one to use

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:43,000
mail or even forms on in word not

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:45,070
kidding but at least at least with with

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,370
this product pivotal Cloud Foundry we

00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,900
know that I want to use the analogy of a

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:54,880
fast car that we are driving right now

00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:56,830
and on a bit of a dirt road at least we

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,020
are already bought the car right so it's

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,700
working fine and it can go fast very

00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,770
fast that gives us the time to

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,730
concentrate on everything else around it

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:10,860
so concentrate on the road so we can we

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:13,300
can we can try to constraint on the

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,650
organizational restrictions that we are

00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:20,770
right now so that's more all related to

00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:23,440
the devops implementation the technical

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,930
restrictions which is now as an example

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,940
that there aren't there are no service

00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:30,370
brokers to use back-end services or

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:34,390
we're not allowed to use the API that is

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:37,930
currently running but also focus on the

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:43,900
processes the processes within a bigger

00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:46,900
organization such as air france-klm but

00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,690
in mind while doing that we have to try

00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:52,150
to not be in island again just to really

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,520
focus only on our thing now this is

00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:57,130
really what we want and please give us

00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,110
or just please work with us and that's

00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,060
it like that and really focus on that we

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,750
have to be careful to be - we have to

00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:07,600
operate like that again

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:09,780
but this also gives us the the means

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,010
implementing this gives us the means to

00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:14,400
standardize a lot of things our

00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:17,050
processes like self services

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:22,300
provisioning of your environment so not

00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:25,360
only within within cloud foundry but but

00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:27,690
also to implement service brokers in the

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,690
future

00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:37,500
and I have to drive social services and

00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:42,360
DevOps are we there yet not at all

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:45,930
far from it but we keep on moving so I

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,370
found this this this thing on the

00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:50,070
internet which is which says about

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,020
present continuous means it means you're

00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,240
here but you're not there you're not

00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,710
what you want where you want to be you

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:01,920
have to keep moving you have to you have

00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:04,010
to go forward so currently my team are

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,410
focusing on three things so we want to

00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:09,030
to bring more features to our clients so

00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:11,160
we are focusing on the service code

00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:14,190
allowed catalogs that would no it's also

00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:17,160
an answer right so if you want to want

00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:20,640
me to PCF set coffee and I might not

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,500
implement that feature for you so but

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,710
also concentrate or the platform itself

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:28,550
so enhance the platform we want to work

00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:33,060
on automating a lot more stuff

00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:36,660
backup/restore working on disaster

00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:39,570
recovery procedures so and also on

00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,270
operations other operations tasks such

00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,770
as guiding team guiding development

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,710
teams on a platform to use the platform

00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:51,870
better to make use of the platform are

00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:53,910
correctly so the title of this

00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:57,480
presentation was sky's the limit but it

00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:59,520
was not anymore it's just where you put

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,320
your bar if you want to reach the sky I

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,150
can go to the Eiffel Tower I'm already

00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:07,710
in the sky but it's not there we're not

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:09,210
there yet so just like in the the

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,610
keynote this morning we talked about the

00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:14,790
space so that's where we want to go so

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,620
in space so what what's next we keep

00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:20,370
onboarding dev teams so currently you

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:23,790
have a lot of teams more than over 50 50

00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:26,220
apps 50 ups 50 apps on unknown

00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:28,880
production and we want to really guide

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,530
them into into production ready status

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,000
but also implementing PCF we want to

00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:36,120
drive their hope so we want to drive

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,940
other departments operations departments

00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,460
we

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,680
of multiple layers of operations

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,330
departments but also development we're

00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,370
going to drive them into DevOps that

00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,470
means that because this platform already

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,690
gives you directly the capability of the

00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:53,140
new years own self-service you provision

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:54,730
your own environment it means that you

00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,130
also have to learn you have to teach

00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:00,400
them to to be responsible for their apps

00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,390
for their environment and developers

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,900
don't want to do that they want to

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:09,010
concentrate on the apps but yeah still

00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:10,810
so this is implementing PCF pivotal

00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,210
finally we want to enable the

00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:17,320
transformation by implementing this

00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:20,760
technology right so the future it's just

00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,470
open hybrid cloud maybe in the future

00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,530
but it's nothing blocking us from that

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,910
right

00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:31,620
the standardizing components like the

00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:33,930
open service broker api's yeah why not

00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:40,180
let's do that

00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:43,260
so sky was the limit not anymore but we

00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:47,260
also want to celebrate so I want to ask

00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:50,380
my team to come up come over here to

00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:57,180
take picture we will take a picture

00:31:50,380 --> 00:32:00,780
together so as a last moment

00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,780
[Laughter]

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,279
anything my architect

00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,910
