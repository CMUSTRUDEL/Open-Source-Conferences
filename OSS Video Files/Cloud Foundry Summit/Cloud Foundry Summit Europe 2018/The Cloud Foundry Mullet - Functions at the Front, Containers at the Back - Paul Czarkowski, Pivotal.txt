Title: The Cloud Foundry Mullet - Functions at the Front, Containers at the Back - Paul Czarkowski, Pivotal
Publication date: 2018-10-10
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2018
Description: 
	The Cloud Foundry Mullet - Functions at the Front, Containers at the Back - Paul Czarkowski, Pivotal

Paul will introduce the audience to the three platforms in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem for Containers as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Functions as a Service and talk through the difference in concepts and uses cases for each. Paul will then talk through how you can apply business logic and lean practices to evaluate your workloads and determine the best platform to run them on.

While Paul will be talking about the Cloud Foundry ecosystem itself the actual platforms are examples of many options out there and the lessons and practices talked about will apply equally to non Cloud Foundry versions of the three platform archetypes ( CaaS, PaaS, FaaS ).
