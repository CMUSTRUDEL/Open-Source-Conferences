Title: Performance of a VM vs. Containerized Cloud Foundry

Description: 
	Performance of a VM vs. Containerized Cloud Foundry - Vlad Iovanov & Jeff Hobbs, SUSE

One of the most asked questions about the new containerized Cloud Foundry is how it compares to a VM-based installation in terms of performance.

In this talk we will discuss the architecture design for containerization of CF, going beyond making containers to make it Kubernetes aware. We will compare a "Kubernetes-native" Cloud Foundry against a "traditional" BOSH OpenStack VM-based installation. Weâ€™ll present numbers to compare how these perform in operation.

The presenter will show the techniques used in these experiments and discuss the comparison between the two styles of deploying Cloud Foundry.

We'll explain our testing methodology and go through the results.

This will include installation/upgrade duration, application start-up and scaling duration, application latency and routing performance.
