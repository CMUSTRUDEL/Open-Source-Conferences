	CF Container Networking: There’s No Place Like 127.0.0.1 - Amelia Downs & Christian Ang, Pivotal

The CF Container Networking team has been up to a lot in the past year. In this talk, two engineers from the CF Container Networking team will walk through how the product has evolved and matured to provide a better experience for operators and app developers.

Polyglot service discovery, which was demoed in its early stages last year, is now GA. Operators can deploy an Envoy as a sidecar on every application instance, creating a service mesh. And changes to the application security groups (ASGs) through dynamic egress makes it simpler for operators to secure their platform.

See it how these new features work through demonstrations and learn about where the CF Container Networking team plans to go next.
