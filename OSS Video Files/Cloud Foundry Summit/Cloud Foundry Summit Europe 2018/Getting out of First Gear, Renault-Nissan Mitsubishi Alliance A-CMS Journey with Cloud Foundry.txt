	Getting out of First Gear, Renault-Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance A-CMS Journey with Cloud Foundry -
Lakshman Diwaakar (LD), Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance & Didier Burkhalter, Pivotal

Within the Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance, A-CMS is developing the Alliance Connected Cloud, which will enable us to connect future, current and past connected vehicles onto the same platform
In less than a year, our A-CMS organization has embraced Cloud Native development, analytics and deployment at scale with bold moves combining acquisitions of engineering specialists and strategic partnership such as with Microsoft. Adopting Cloud Foundry was one big bet as well.
Come hear about our journey across France and Japan and how we leveraged and expanded the specifics of Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Concourse and Azure to implement our architecture with secure-first, global-ready and automate-everything core goals in our design.
