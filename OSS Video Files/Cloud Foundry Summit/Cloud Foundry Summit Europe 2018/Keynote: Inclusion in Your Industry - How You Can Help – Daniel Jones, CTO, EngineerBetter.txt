Description: 
	Keynote: Inclusion in Your Industry - How You Can Help – Daniel Jones, CTO, EngineerBetter

If you've ever been frustrated and disheartened by the state of diversity in the tech industry and wondered what you can do to help, then this talk is for you. It can be hard to know what to do when there are so many conflicting passionate views, so Daniel outlines an approach founded in psychology research and the experience of martial arts training. Daniel highlights findings that dispel common misconceptions and prove the benefits of an inclusive approach, in addition to explaining the subtle psychological effects of group membership that affect us all. This presentation includes references to violence and challenging topics.

[Applause]

00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:16,460
[Music]

00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,320
chips just totally ruined my first slide

00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,300
like you shouldn't tell lies about me

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,710
being nice okay my staff over there they

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:27,199
know the truth so I'd like to thank the

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,119
Cloud Foundry Foundation for inviting me

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,740
up here to speak and I'm particularly

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,509
like thanks Warner for giving me the

00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,300
push and the support that I needed to be

00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,460
up here giving this talk to you today

00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,680
I'm here to share some experiences that

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,750
I've had that have helped shape how I

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,500
think about trying to create an

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,460
inclusive environment at work one of

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:54,140
those experiences

00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:56,030
it's punching women in the face this is

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,620
a self-defense course that I was on a

00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,840
couple of years ago I'm on the floor on

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,320
the left with a massive bruise on the

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,320
back of my leg

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,060
the one that I was training with is

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,189
called majeure she teaches and his

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,509
really Israeli military martial art

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,030
called Krav Maga

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,810
I didn't gets going these courses very

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:28,110
often anymore I have business to run I

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,299
have children but I do did spend the

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,429
best part of 10 years training out and

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,610
going on to teach the London Southbank

00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:37,470
University jiu-jitsu club South Point

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,750
University has a really high proportion

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,700
of international student students and

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,920
mature students which means there's a

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,720
really diverse mix of people coming

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,840
through the university and also coming

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,240
through my club as well as students we

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,950
had everything from unemployed people to

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,220
investment bankers turning up at the

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,920
club we had people from every religion

00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,259
you can think of and people from all

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,950
around the world every continent except

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,750
Antarctica

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,579
we have people suffering from mental

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,890
illness we have people who were deaf

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,859
partially sighted dyspraxia

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,109
we had refugees from war-torn countries

00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:16,079
and we have members of the military who

00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:17,790
had invaded those war-torn countries so

00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:21,139
I was very lucky to be part of such a

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,030
diverse melting pot of different people

00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:26,819
one of the things I love most about the

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,739
organization the jitsu foundation that

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,680
my club was a part of was that everybody

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,840
was treated equally and nowhere was this

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,530
tip fire demonstrated more than in

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,150
gradings this isn't a grading the

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,680
grading x' weren't filmed and they

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,560
looked a hell of a lot more messy than

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,540
this but when you wanted your next belt

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,639
you went to a grading and there was a

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,900
quality bar that was set and it was

00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,780
lowered for no one

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,139
it didn't matter with you a big or small

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,239
with you a male or female whether you'd

00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,100
been fasting all day or whether you had

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,799
swine flu that happened to a friend of

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,819
mine you got attacked just as hard as

00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:04,819
everybody else did

00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:12,299
sometimes I've been in the dojo when men

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,970
decided that they needed to attack women

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:16,870
less hard thinking that they needed to

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,209
give them an easy ride somehow

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,980
when that happened those men were

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:24,310
threatened we've been thrown out to the

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,140
dojo because it's not okay to make

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,480
assumptions based on what someone looks

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,170
like about what they can handle and how

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,540
proficient they are and it is downright

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,610
disrespectful to deny people the

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:42,700
opportunity to prove themselves by

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:46,360
giving them an easy ride that was the

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,769
greatest okay and we didn't spend most

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,709
of our time in gratings we spent most of

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:52,750
our time training and in a training

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,630
session over the course of a couple of

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,760
hours a instructor words show you a

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,519
particular attack and a defense against

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,599
that attack and throughout the course of

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,730
a couple of hours you've worked with

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,579
different partners changing partners

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:10,299
regularly to drill just that attack and

00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:12,489
defense in isolation now if when you

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,650
worked with a new partner the first

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,449
thing you did was punch them as hard as

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,549
you possibly could like you would

00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:19,930
integrating then the chances are that

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:23,020
they're probably not going to learn very

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,900
much additionally you're going to make

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,750
yourself quite unpopular and the last

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,490
thing you want to be is unpopular when

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,900
at the end of the session the weapons

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,380
come out and people get the chance to

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,820
swing a baseball bat at your head so

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,430
instead when you're working with someone

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,700
knew you had to treat them as an

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,700
individual and be responsive to what

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,840
they needed that meant that you had to

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,800
listen to what they were saying to you

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,470
sometimes these sessions were get tough

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,979
so you'd have to motivate each other

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,870
it was hard knowing what you were doing

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:02,680
wrong sometimes you needed somebody to

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,419
spot that for you and most of all you

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,190
had to change what you were doing so

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:11,919
that the other person could get as much

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:15,490
out of the session as possible so fast

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,070
forward a few years and I had to move

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,030
for work became a parent didn't have

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,870
time to teach anymore

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,340
I which is a shame and I miss it greatly

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:29,229
but I did become a Cloud Foundry

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:30,470
consultants and after going to a few

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,780
diversity lunches

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,420
çf summits i ended up reading a really

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,710
awesome book called delusions of gender

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:42,140
by professor Cordelia fine now this book

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,330
collects a whole bunch of research that

00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:48,290
dispels common misconceptions about

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:50,810
gender based performance differences for

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,970
example you may have heard the

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,980
stereotype that men are better at maths

00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:58,160
and women are better at communication

00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,590
and it seems like a lot of people have

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,280
heard this stereotype because one study

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,800
found that if you ask people in a survey

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,350
to rate their ability in different areas

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,600
the men will say that they're better at

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,990
maths and women will say they're better

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,380
at communication but only if you ask

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:22,520
their gender at the top of the survey if

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:24,470
you don't ask their gender then men

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,660
don't rate themselves as highly at maths

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:30,140
and women don't rate themselves as

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,370
highly at communication that first case

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,550
is an example of something called

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,530
stereotype boost when you're reminded

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,750
that you're part of a group about whom

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,800
there's a positive stereotype you live

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:46,010
up to that stereotype but this doesn't

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,190
just affect people's self perception it

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,930
can affect their performance as well you

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,590
may have heard of the stereotype that

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,740
men are bad at empathizing researchers

00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:00,860
looked into this and gave men a social

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,900
sensitivity test this is one you have to

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,500
guess who this woman is speaking to on

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,630
the phone when researchers gave men a

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,830
social sensitivity test and told them

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,900
it's about understanding people's

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,150
thoughts and feelings and that

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,700
historically men aren't very good at

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,070
social sensitivity tests you know what

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:22,220
the men performed worse than the women

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:25,100
did on these tests but when researchers

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,130
gave the same social sensitivity test

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,169
the exact same tests to a different

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,860
group of men and told them it was about

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:36,830
complex information processing and they

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,590
neglected to mention that men

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,570
historically have been bad at this the

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,630
men performed just as well as the women

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,130
did

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,670
that first case is something called

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,830
stereotype threat when you're reminded

00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,410
that you're part of a group about whom

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:57,190
there are negative stereotypes it can

00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:59,250
negatively impact your performance if

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,290
you think you're bad at something and

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,540
you think that everyone else thinks

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,310
you're going to be bad at something it's

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,450
going to be very hard to apply yourself

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:14,500
fully to the task at hand now it also

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,300
seems like motivation has an effect here

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,640
as well

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,350
this is a mental image rotation task

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,870
I've not highlighted the right answer

00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,700
because I want to drive you all crazy

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,750
men are supposed to be better at this

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:31,930
than women however a study found that if

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:34,210
you quite rightly tell men that being

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:38,140
good at these tasks will make them good

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:40,660
at a career in flower arranging then

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,950
they score 20% less well than if you

00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:48,070
tell them it will make them a good

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:49,660
fighter pilot so what's going on here

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,670
there's a complicated picture we got

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,560
stereotype boost stereotype threats

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,890
there are these cultural motivational

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,990
issues going on as well what it's

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,270
telling us is although there is a body

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,370
of evidence showing these gender

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,890
performance differences dating back

00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:10,180
decades that evidence doesn't tell us

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:12,190
the cause of these differences more

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,520
recent studies have shown us clearly

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,130
that the way that we treat people has

00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,470
such a big effect that it can cancel out

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,470
these performance differences altogether

00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,890
so reading that book was one experience

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,590
the next one was talking to my friend

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,070
three Stowell at pivotal who put me onto

00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:38,140
the work of Karen Holtz Platt

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,150
Karen who is a user researcher who has

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,930
turned her professional skills to trying

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:45,550
to find out why women leave tech jobs

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:48,940
you may have seen her speak at the

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,500
diversity lunch last year now

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,660
Carrie's findings were typical of most

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,000
people I think she found that in order

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,000
to stay in tech jobs women needed to be

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,970
part of high-performing

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,810
tight-knit teams they needed to be doing

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,240
meaningful cutting-edge technical work

00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:11,210
she also found like chefs she also found

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,910
that most like there like most people

00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,660
women needed to be given a push and

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,180
encouragement to take more

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,250
responsibility and to take more risks

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,660
and the ones have been pushed into the

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:27,210
limelight they need to be given support

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:30,570
having just read delusions of gender it

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:33,000
seemed clear to me that if women needed

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,860
more of a push that's not because women

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,700
are somehow intrinsically lacking in

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,010
confidence

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,250
we've got enough female UFC cage

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:44,640
fighters and prime ministers to disprove

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:49,440
that maybe it's because they're women in

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:52,410
tech being part of a conspicuous

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,200
minority is a really great way of

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,970
reminding you every day that you're part

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:06,380
of a group about whom there might be

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:09,320
negative stereotypes now I told you

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:12,570
about Karen being at the diversity lunch

00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,820
this bits unscripted right so I'm gonna

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,760
go a little bit over Steve's told

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,380
yesterday that he was part of the

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,990
problem because he didn't go to the

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,890
oversee lunches he didn't partake in the

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,339
conversation I used to and I stopped

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,190
going

00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:31,860
I stopped attending diversity events

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,320
because I was frustrated at problem

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,600
statements I would go along to events I

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,850
would hear that there are not enough of

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,830
different types of people in tech but no

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,760
one told me what I could do better no

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:47,430
one told me what I was doing wrong so I

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,620
stopped turning up I I saw Karen's

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:55,110
research in a podcast instead and a

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:57,990
webinar but lucky me I get to leave the

00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,030
conversation when it suits me I get to

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,450
ignore the diversity topic when it

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:08,339
frustrates me not everyone has that

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:09,870
luxury this talk came about because I

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,520
wanted to find out what I could do

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,070
better

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:18,530
some action some actionable advice and

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:22,100
that's how I ended up here so what can

00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:23,030
we do when we're trying to make the

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,800
world a better place

00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,480
should we be highlighting in particular

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,210
groups that we're aware of and giving

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,980
them special treatment well whether we

00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,610
like it or not if we start highlighting

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,890
people's differences we could act just

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,890
like that gender tick box at the top of

00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:42,350
the survey we could trigger stereotype

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,910
threats by making our differences more

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,260
clear

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,090
not to mention minority spotlight

00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,520
effects where people are made to feel

00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,230
more anxious and less welcomed as a

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,940
result of having their minority status

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:58,520
highlighted sometimes some people just

00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,660
want to get on with their job they don't

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,800
want to be the representative minority

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,020
speaking on behalf a whole demographic

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,300
of people despite being just one

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,610
individual these are the words of Sarah

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,710
Novotny from Google at the last year's

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:18,140
diversity luncheon used with her

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:20,450
permission it's a good one dan you've

00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,880
come up here you've told us a load of

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,740
stuff that's not gonna work

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,110
great that's really helping move the

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,650
conversation forward isn't it so really

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:33,350
what can we do the good news is when it

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,480
comes to stereotype threat just telling

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,630
people about it is enough to start

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,440
mitigating its effects in a u.s. College

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:44,330
study students were given a maths exam

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,220
some of the female students were told if

00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,630
you feel nervous about this exam it

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,730
could be because you've heard the

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:54,190
stereotype that men are better at maths

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:57,410
it's just a stereotype those women

00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:00,560
reported higher levels of anxiety during

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,200
the exam but importantly they performed

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,420
just as well as the men did unlike those

00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:12,020
who hadn't been told about stereotype

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:14,720
threat now I've talked a lot about

00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,770
gender so far but clearly there are all

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,730
sorts of underrepresented groups in tech

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,740
there are some minorities that are

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,000
obvious there are some people that will

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,590
have lived their whole lives as a

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,720
minority in their car

00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:29,000
and probably show the signs of chronic

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,950
minority stress where they've got

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,160
observably lower health as a result of a

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,750
lifetime of being marginalized but there

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,270
are lots of minority groups that we

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,190
can't see people whose sexuality isn't

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,620
overt people struggling with mental

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:46,880
illness the parent whose child is

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:49,400
terminally ill maybe even the distant

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,290
programmer struggling with the scars of

00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:55,460
horrific childhood trauma that they

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:58,010
don't even want you to know about if we

00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,720
focus our attention on the groups that

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,390
we could see then we're going to miss

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,220
all of these people all of the people

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:08,660
that find themselves at the intersection

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:14,390
of different groups so how can we help

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:17,360
everyone well we can treat people as

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:21,110
individuals and be responsive to their

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,620
needs we can listen to what they have to

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:27,860
say to us we can encourage each other

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,930
when the going gets tough we can help

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,210
each other

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:34,790
identify our blind spots and most

00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:37,250
importantly we can change what we're

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:40,880
doing in order to allow other people to

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:44,330
fulfill their potential now I'm not

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,490
saying that this is going I'm not saying

00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,080
we should be blind to the systemic

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,790
injustice --is that people are faced

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,030
getting here and will continue to face

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,980
I'm not saying that treating people as

00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,930
individuals is going to fix all of these

00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,150
systems but it's something that we can

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:04,880
all do every day to help make a positive

00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:07,850
difference now yesterday Steve Greenberg

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,300
was exactly right to tell people that

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:14,480
everybody is welcome not just because

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,710
it's true but because it makes a

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,600
difference in another US College study

00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,430
minority students before they started

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,090
their academic career were given a

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:29,030
15-minute intervention a 15-minute chat

00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:30,890
in which they were told if you feel like

00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,630
you don't belong here you feel like

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,080
you're the odd one out don't worry about

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,660
it

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,889
everyone feels like the odd one out when

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,980
they first start

00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,149
everyone's welcome everyone belongs look

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,459
at the people with I've been here for a

00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:48,139
year they've all fit in just fine and

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:51,769
made friends two years later they had

00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:54,519
significantly better grades better

00:16:51,769 --> 00:17:00,290
academic performance after two years

00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:04,039
from just a 15 minute chat imagine what

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:07,549
we can do if people feel welcome all of

00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:10,579
the time now if you've ever been the new

00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:13,519
kid in class there is no amount of

00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:16,579
effort that you can take to make you

00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,250
feel welcome there's no amount of will

00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:22,189
and things that you can do to make you

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:25,279
feel like you belong the only people

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:28,220
that can do that are the people that are

00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:32,870
already here any of these faces look

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,340
familiar if you're in this audience the

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,389
chances are you work in the tech

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,730
industry only you can make other people

00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:43,100
feel welcome

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:45,429
you are the culture and the context in

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,889
which other people have to do their jobs

00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:51,500
you can help people fulfill their

00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:59,029
potential by making them know that they

00:17:51,500 --> 00:18:01,039
belong only you can do that now if

00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:03,169
you're looking for the research that's

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,720
gone into this talk don't go driving

00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:08,330

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,480
pay for Cordelia fines book go and look

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:14,870
up Karen Holtz Black's work and

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,700
collaborate with her thank you for

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,850
listening and staying out for this talk

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,830
and have an awesome conference and go

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:25,299
and make sure that everybody else feels

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,299
welcome to be here thank you
