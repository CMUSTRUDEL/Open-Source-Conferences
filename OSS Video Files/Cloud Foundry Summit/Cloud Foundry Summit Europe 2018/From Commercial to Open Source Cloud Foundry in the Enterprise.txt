Description: 
	From Commercial to Open Source Cloud Foundry in the Enterprise - Rachael Wonnacott, Fidelity
International

Fidelityâ€™s PaaS supports business critical applications such as retail websites and trading systems, while offering a six-9s SLA across both the UK and Asia. A key driver in their cloud strategy has always been to deliver features to developers in a cost effective way. The transition to using open source Cloud Foundry has afforded Fidelity the autonomy to tailor releases to meet the rising demand from developers. Fidelity would like to share their experience focusing on the deployment and migration decisions (running two CFs in parallel, migrating applications with zero down-time, and the benefits of a single deployment mechanism). In addition, to explore the ongoing implications for the globally distributed PaaS team who operate it (increased responsibility, utilisation of the open-source community, and the change in workload) and ask - 'Is the platform sustainable?'
