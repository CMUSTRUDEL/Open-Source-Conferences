	Making Sense of BOSH Links Through Visualization - Jamil Shamy & Saman Alvi, Pivotal

As links move towards becoming a cornerstone in the BOSH deployments architecture, especially with the addition of BOSH Links API, a new mechanism describing Links Providers and Consumers and the relationships between them is needed.
Taking a CloudFoundry deployment as an example, on average more than 100 links will be created during a deployment. In this session, Jamil Shamy (Pivotal) and Saman Alvi (Pivotal) will be presenting a BOSH CLI extension that enables the visualization and categorization of inner and cross deployment Links; aiming towards a better understanding of the deployed software.
