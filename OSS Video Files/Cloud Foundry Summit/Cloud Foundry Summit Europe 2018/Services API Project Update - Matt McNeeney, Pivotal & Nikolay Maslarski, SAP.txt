	Services API Project Update - Matt McNeeney, Pivotal & Nikolay Maslarski, SAP

The Cloud Foundry Services API team is responsible for:
- The developer experience provisioning and managing services in Cloud Foundry Application Runtime.
- Making it easier to build and integrate service brokers with all Cloud Foundry platforms.

This second project update from the team will include:
- What we’ve been working on in 2018, including the ability to create bindings asynchronously and the ability to register the same broker multiple times
- What we’re going to be working on soon, including replacing the Basic Auth mechanism with oAuth to improve platform to service broker security
- How the Services API team is contributing to the Open Service Broker API specification to make Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes better together

We'll then give a live demo showing some of the new developer experiences we’ve built in action.
