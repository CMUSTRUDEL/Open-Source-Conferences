Linus's Law applied to security could read "given enough eyeballs, all security vulnerabilities are discoverable." 

This session will focus on how the community can get involved in security testing to make Cloud Foundry more secure. Dan will explain how to responsibly disclosure security vulnerabilities found in Cloud Foundry and what the triage process looks like once you have submitted a report. He will then discuss some historical vulnerabilities and general security testing concepts to get you jump started on security testing.
