	Changing the Tires at 100mph: How CF Enabled Us to Swap Development Languages Without Missing a Beat - Anouska Streets, Fiserv

We’ve all heard the microservices hype: how small independent polyglot services enable rapid and sustainable delivery of digital products and business value; how architectural and technological decisions previously baked into an application can now be deferred and changed with ease; and how Cloud Foundry is the optimised, opinionated platform for operating those services in production on Day Two and beyond. But what happens when Day Two comes and you need to migrate all of your existing services from one language and framework to another, without impacting production operations?

Join Anouska Streets as she discusses the highs and lows, trials and tribulations she faced when her FinKit Engineering team migrated their entire running microservice-based system from one language to another, with the business demanding zero downtime, and zero impact to either the client services running on the platform or the end consumers of those services. She’ll describe the patterns and approaches they used for this migration, the challenges they faced, and the techniques they used to overcome them. Did they manage it? Join us to find out!
