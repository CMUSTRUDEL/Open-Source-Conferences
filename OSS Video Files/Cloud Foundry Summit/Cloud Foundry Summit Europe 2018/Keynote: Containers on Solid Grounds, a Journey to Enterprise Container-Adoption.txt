	Keynote: Containers on Solid Grounds, a Journey to Enterprise Container-Adoption â€“ Egon Steinkasserer, Chief Product Officer Enterprise Customers, Swisscom & Christian Bach, Chief Application Architect, Swiss Re

Closing the gap between its Cloud Foundry PaaS and cloud infrastructure services, Swisscom is developing an enterprise container service based on the Pivotal Container Service (PKS). Together with Swiss Re, a customer of the first hour, we shaped a coherent, integrated cloud solution spanning all our offerings and are writing on a new chapter in both of our cloud journeys.
