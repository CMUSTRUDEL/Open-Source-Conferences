	Running .Net Apps on Cloud Foundry in a Hybrid Environment - Ning Kuang & Thomas Shao, Microsoft

.Net is getting the first-class seats on Cloud Foundry. In this section, we will walk through how a .net application is built, deployed and managed, in a hybrid environment, with the .net ecosystem on CF. We will deploy an ASP.net web service, utilizing CI/CD tool, Open Service Broker, Monitoring and logging tool, and more. You will experience how .net is seamlessly integrated with the Cloud Foundry dev environment across on-prem and cloud platforms, and understand the newest progress with .Net. support on CF.
