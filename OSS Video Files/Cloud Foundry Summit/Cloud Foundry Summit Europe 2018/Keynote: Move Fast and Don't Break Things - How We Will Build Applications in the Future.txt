Description: 
	Keynote: Move Fast and Don't Break Things - How We Will Build Applications in the Future – Daniela Rabiser, Technical Product Manager, Dynatrace & Tim Gerlach, Software Developer, SAP

Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy and scale your applications. However, there is still a high burden on development and operations teams to ensure that delivered applications and microservices are always up and running and that business functionality is available for end users. Dynatrace and SAP partnered to build a platform that will automatically hold back pipeline propagation for breaking changes or roll back faulty deployments that affect your end users. This allows developers to innovate fast while still having a security net which ensures if something breaks it will be fixed automatically following the mantra “Move fast and don’t break things.”
