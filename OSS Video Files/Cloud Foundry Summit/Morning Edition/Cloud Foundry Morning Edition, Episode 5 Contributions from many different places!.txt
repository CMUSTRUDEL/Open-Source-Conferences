00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:22,710

00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:24,810
about how a lot of governments are

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,230

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,060
government Korea and others and within

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,940
the last week we had a visit from man

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,100
not hitting the the MP the Minister

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,930

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,100
really awesome things happening in the

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,030
area of government and Cloud Foundry

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,960
usage so hopefully we'll see more condor

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,670
helping to help out the public also last

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,949
week we closed the the call for

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,370
proposals for the Berlin cloud foundry

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,999

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,589
companies on 44 topics all that for 18

00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:05,220
slots so it's a really gonna be an

00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:06,299
awesome agenda this week I wanted to

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,740
talk a little bit about all the

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,270
contributions that come from different

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,460
companies I really think there's a theme

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,439
here this week so for example we have a

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,960
nice contribution by General Electric to

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,500
Cloud Foundry TCP riving and you can go

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,930
check that out

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,180
and Dan Hickman I'm posted on Twitter

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,040
that using that TCP ready he got a

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,840
minecraft server running on lattice and

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,579
he claims it was super easy I'm gonna

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,969
have to go try that or make my kids try

00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:32,520
that I'm also on companies using cloud

00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,200
foundry cisco collaboration of runs on

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,790
cloud foundry and they are hiring a new

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,410
look to us to mount something around

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,270
certification soon and what it means

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,730
actually be quad foundry at cloud

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,349
foundry certified and how users can make

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,599
sure that their apps are portable across

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,550
all of these different instances of 500

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,840
so very exciting news coming up there

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,400
soon and then we have some tweets on

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,080
Twitter about how things have been going

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,390
really well for people there was some

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,700
platform engineering group that did a

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,560
zero downtime migration of their live

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,080
quad factory environment so it's always

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,640
great fun to see in here about that and

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,350
then we had a whole bunch of meetups

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,330
happen that have happened and are

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,430
happening and so when you think meet ups

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,690
maybe you think talks and you think you

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,910

00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,799
London group did live a little

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,019
differently

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,850
the London group actually had their meet

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,920
up at the pub with beer which just seems

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,330
very very appropriate for London but if

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,099

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,040
with one of them or have a meet-up in

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,920
your local pub or bar or brewery or

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,000
whatever is common in your area so

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,890
tomorrow night we're having the meetup

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,079
