    An OpenStack survey found Cloud Foundry was the most popular PaaS tool.
    CA Technologies’s new release of CA Application Performance Management can now monitor Cloud Foundry.
    Iron.io joins the Cloud Foundry and its tools now support Cloud Foundry.
    Cloud Foundry can be used to deploy Apache Spark. How have you used Cloud Foundry with stateful services?
    Use Lattice and Diego to manage microservices.
    China’s public cloud market to double by 2020.
    Cloud Foundry Meetups: 42 in October!
    From the doc sprint comes this definition of Cloud Foundry: Cloud Foundry is an open source platform for application lifecycle automation. Deploy, monitor, recover, scale, and update your apps. Develop with your favorite cloud-native application framework, then just cf push.
    Kick off meeting for certification for application developers and operators is this Thursday. We are going to discuss what certification is, how we might set up the processes and how we’d do it. This way we’ll create a vibrant ecosystem of qualified people that organizations can easily engage with. If you are interested in participating in defining that, let us know!
    Cloud Foundry contributors are hanging out on Slack. If you have an email address from one of the Cloud Foundry Foundation companies, you can sign yourself up. Otherwise, reach out to us.
    Berlin Summit next week! Unconference on Sunday, training and SIGs on Monday, meetup organizers meetup on Monday. Join us!

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,120
Cloud Foundry Morning Edition a podcast

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,940
webcast here to bring you the latest

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,200
news in the Cloud Foundry world good

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,360
morning good afternoon good evening

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,560
welcome to Cloud Foundry morning edition

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,960
episode 9

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,250
my name is stormy Peters and I'm VP of

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,769
technical evangelism of the Cloud

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,740
Foundry foundation once again I'm here

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,789
with some big news first off I'm going

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,330
to start with a survey that the

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,340
OpenStack opens dr. org did they

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,840
surveyed all of their users and ask them

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,610
what the most popular paths ask them

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,640
what their favorite path tool was and

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,860
guess who won Cloud Foundry Cloud

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,420
Foundry did so awesome to see that they

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,460
are sticking with open-source software

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,890
tools and that Cloud Foundry is meeting

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,989
a lot of their needs then we had two

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,440
large organizations make some news this

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,510
week the first one is MCA technologies

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,730
they have application performance

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,559
management tool and they announced this

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,960
week that it's it's supporting Cloud

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,820
Foundry as well as node.js and docker so

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,519
great news to the organizations that use

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,100
cloud foundry Ducker nca technologies

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,740
now they have more integration and more

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,799
options other big news on the foundation

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,630
side from a company is from iron io iron

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,909
IO joined the cloud foundry foundation

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,740
this week and they have a set of tools

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,770
that do things like job queuing

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,299
scheduling processing and so they're

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,939
bringing all of that support to cloud

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,290
foundry so awesome news from those two

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,509
large organizations that have

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,140
established presence in this world in

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,970
the space bringing their tools to cloud

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,700
foundry and to cloud foundry users

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,040
everywhere then there was a couple of

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,259
news like in the what you can do with

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,670
Cod foundry type space and I thought

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,890
they were interesting and I also thought

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,960
it was interesting I thought maybe you

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,270
all as listeners might have other

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,799
stories you could share with me and but

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,409
I saw that cloud foundry could be used

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,149
at the Play Apache spark which is kind

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,320
of interesting and I was wondering if

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:03,240
anybody else had used cases of you know

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,920
stateful services running on Bosh or

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,210
cloud foundry so if you have done

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,060
something like that and you want to

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,410
share you can share alive on a video and

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,330
record yourself or you can just send me

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,770
an email and I'd be happy to mention it

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,070
I'd love to share more about how people

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,040
are doing things and then there was a

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,820
new stack article on laddus diego that

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,910
talked about being able to use Sousa

00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,530
laddus is like a kind of like a subset

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,660
of cloud foundry helps you manage

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,170
clusters and helps you schedule things

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:37,560
and they were talking about using Diego

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,840
and and lattis to launch microcircuits

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,250
to manage your micro services and and

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,130
how that's kind of like a lightweight

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,720
way to manage micro services within your

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,780
organization or within your application

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,100
space so that might also be interesting

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,050
to you if you're seeing if you have a

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,520
need to run micro services and if you've

00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:59,340
done something similar let me know again

00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,890
in kind of the world's industry level of

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,020
news there was a study that came out

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,280
that said that the China public cloud

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,650
market was going to double to 38 billion

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,160
u.s. dollars by 2020

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,140
so we know that now is the time that

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,370
passes growing in China now is the time

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,959
that people are looking at Cloud Foundry

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,760
we have a lot of interest there and

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,580
that's why we're having the cloud

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,709
founders summit in Asia in shedding in

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,830
Shanghai China in the first week of

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,840
December December second third and now

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,730
they're I mean there's been confirmation

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,890
of this but this is yet another piece of

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,470
news that supports the fact that paas

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:41,310
and cloud foundry are really gonna grow

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,900
in China very soon so if that's at all

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,160
in your business model or all something

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,380
that would be interesting to you as an

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,360
organization and take a look at the

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,910
Cloud Foundry summit in Asia and and

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,290
Shanghai and consider coming you'll be

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,360
great time to meet people learn more

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,890
about what's happening there and to meet

00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,209
potential clients and partners the other

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,650
thing I want to follow up with as I

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,420
promised you a video that I haven't done

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,850
yet but I wanted to show the definition

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,150
with you a couple of weeks ago at the

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:12,209
Cloud Foundry dock sprint we worked on

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,100
like a concise way to define what is

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,979
Cloud Foundry that we all agree on and

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,109
it was kind of a fun exercise it it took

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,340
a day not all day solid but you know

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,130
over the course of the day we kept

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,020
revisiting it and we came up with a

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,740
longer one and then a shorter tweetable

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,860
one

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,930
the longer one is Cloud Foundry is an

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,870
open source platform for applications

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,560
lifecycle automation deploy monitor

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,610
recover scale and update your apps

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,160
develop with your favorite cloud native

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,270
application framework than just CF push

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,069
and then we tried to work on a tweetable

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,650
definition a tweetable version of that

00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,449
and we came up with Cloud Foundry is an

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,789
open source platform for application

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,169
lifecycle automation develop with your

00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:58,380
favorite cloud native application

00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,550
framework then just CF push so let me

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,139
know what you think about those feel

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:05,009
free to use that wording anywhere in

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,270
everywhere you would like other things

00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,210
that we're working outside was the docs

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,070
print looking now at defining what would

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,440
it looking at exploring and defining

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,840
what would it mean to have a Cloud

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,030
Foundry certification process for

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,550
individuals for experts so what would it

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,250
mean if you could take a class or take a

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,870
test and improve your Cloud Foundry

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,909
knowledge and then be able to put that

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,500
on your resume perhaps have your own

00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,479
website where you could talk you know

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,030
talk about what you've done that future

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,320
employers could look at what would that

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,090
mean and what would that look like and

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,530
if you are interested in joining that

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,210
conversation this is an open-source

00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,580
software project and that is an open

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,229
process so feel free to ping me and I'll

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,599
invite you to the meeting we're having a

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:48,000
kickoff meeting tomorrow day after

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,699
tomorrow Thursday this week and then

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,020
it'll be an ongoing process on that note

00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,180
if you are interested in getting more

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,500
involved with Cloud Foundry we do have a

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,719
slack instance where a lot of the

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,750
contributors are talking so it's Cloud

00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:02,340
Foundry slack com if you have an email

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,080
address that belongs to any of our

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,570
member companies you should be able to

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,919
just sign up if you don't belong to one

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,449

meetups and events so just continue the

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:25,320
awesome flow of meetups we have had 30

in October so far and we have 12 more

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,030
this week Thursday seems to be the day

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,099
to have meetups maybe it's like a hybrid

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,479
of like still in your work week but

00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,010
wanting to socialize a little bit for

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,670
the weekends but Thursday night seems to

00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,890
be that Cloud Foundry night

00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,930
where things happen I think there's like

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,910
six or seven on Thursday night I'm

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,950

America Europe pick your pick your

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,180
location or try to meet get to all of

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,770
them and on that note I'm trying to meet

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,720
up with all the meet-up organizers

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,250
because I want to tell them about the

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,290
speaker travel program that we have

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,620
about all the speakers who've offered to

00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:01,990
help so I'm trying to meet all the

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,310
meetup organizers so if you've been to a

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,170
meet-up or if you are a meet-up

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,210
organizer if you could introduce me to

00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,620
that organizer that would be awesome

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,470
I'm gonna email them all through meetup

00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,290
comm it thinks I'm a spammer so I need

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,550
some personal connections here so if you

can help that would be great

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,570
so go to your local meetup and then

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,880
don't forget that the Cloud Foundry

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,190
summit is happening in Berlin next week

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,720
so I think a lot of you going from North
