that made the handout I showed last week

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,390
they join the Cloud Foundry foundation

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,449
so they are newest member and there's a

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,189
blog post interviewing their CTO on our

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,070
on our blog right now if you'd like to

go take a look at that we also have a

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,320
lot of new stuff on the blog there's a

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,939
series about abacus by dr. max it's a

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,590
three part series I think two parts are

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,270
out now or the second part will be out

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,130
Friday we also have a new series by our

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,409
Cloud Foundry Japan meetup group they're

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,689
doing a hundred days of apps in a series

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,450
of posts so we're like on the second

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,509
post so look forward to seeing more of

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,799
what they're doing in Japan getting apps

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,710
running on Cloud Foundry it's really

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,090
awesome the colorado meetup group is

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,750
meeting next week they're having

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,250
DigitalGlobe

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,409
another user talk they're doing an

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,270
amazing job of getting users speaking at

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,590
their meetups so if you are a Cloud

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,329
Foundry user and want to speak at a

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,430
meet-up meetups around the world would

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,890
like to have you because they're really

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,649
very popular to have people speak about

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,790
how they're actually using Cloud Foundry

00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:58,290
we had a number of people speaking at

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,619
meetups too we had a normal slew of

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,020
meetups but in particular I know that KC

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,310
spoke at the Sydney meetup and for the

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,439
first time he spoke in his hometown of

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,429
Pittsburgh I find it kind of ironic he

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,410
traveled around the world

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,740
this is KC West speaking and all the

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,590
other meetups in that at home dr. Nikki

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,260
a very popular talk about why do I need

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,000
to learn Cloud Foundry I just learned

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,400
you could probably put named your tool

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,130
in there but I forget what tool was

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,540
there's a link in the notes to this and

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,910
then I have a couple of projects going

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,340
on that I could use help with if anyone

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,260
wants to help we are kicking off the

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,300
expert certification so this is not

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,850
certification of the code but um

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,830
certification of people I'm showing that

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,630
they know Cloud Foundry and we are

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,970
kicking off what's involved in that in

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,310
in person meaning March first and second

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,950
so if you work at a company that hires

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,540
um Cloud Foundry experts and would like

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,030
to be part of defining what it is you'd

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,410
be looking for or if you are a Cloud

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,050
Foundry expert and would like to help

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,340
define what you think is involved and

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,650
using Cloud Foundry we would love to

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,450
have your participation there you can

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,770
apply just by sending me email storming

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,000
at Cloud Foundry org

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:11,430
I'm also um started a Google Doc to edit

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,070
our Wikipedia page we'll have someone

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,040
not affiliated with with the foundation

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:19,530
submit the the changes but if you want

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,510
to help update the page it's woefully

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,980
out of date so looking for is

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,740
particularly neutral people to help

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,610
update that page and then the cab call

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,800
um if you don't participate in the the

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,730
Cloud Foundry advisory board meetings

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,190
where all the PM's

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,710
that I say that right right acronym all

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,350
the PM's get together and give updates

00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,180
on their their projects um it's very

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,220
informative and they're actually doing a

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,570
survey right now about what you would

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,180
like to see in that meeting so if you

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,800
used to attend don't attend now now's

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,570
your time to give feedback and say what

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,980
you'd like to see there um if you do

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,510
attend and you like it you should say

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,480
that too and if you attended and you'd

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,400
like to see something different please

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,310
chime in but there was a lot of updates

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,720
in that meeting and Horace took notes

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,850
and they're on their blog I have a link

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,270
to it in the notes but just to give you

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,580
a flavor of what was happening there the

00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,200
mega team got two new members um there

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,200
was actually a couple of new teams

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,299
launched so IBM and pivotal and launched

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,980
a new team together call the a bit

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,400
service team it's in the incubation

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,380
project right now I say P started

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,870
working on abacus and they added

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,480
for mongodb and now they're working at

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,890
abacus clunkers there's a new

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,350
persistence team that was at the team I

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:37,770
was thinking of led by Ted young and

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,180
it's called Prezi I think Percy Percy

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,420
it's called Percy's that persistence he

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,450
was called Percy and there they would

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,340
like to know their question of the group

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,170
at the meeting was they'd like to know

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,570
what sort of distributed file systems

00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,460
Cloud Foundry users are using and how

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,420
they're using them so that they can do

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,280
the right things in the persistence team

00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,320
in addition to the teams getting new

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,110
members and new teams being formed um

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,640
there are a lot of updates the the

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,380
command-line interface team has been

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,930
updating all their Docs and integrating

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,610
that let's see if help they've added

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,740
routing they've gotten routing working

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,930
with CLI to support the routing team is

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,690
working with the CLI team to support

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:23,370
multiple app ports and TCP routing the

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:27,540
Bosh team announced the EMC released a

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:29,700
bare-metal CPI called RAC HD the Bosh

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,200
teams also bash defying all the build

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,820
packs so they're supporting the Bosh

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,830
release of each build pack they're in

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,090
the middle of that you can see which

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,350
ones are done and which ones are coming

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,240
up in the minutes and there was a whole

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,760
bunch more that that was kind of the the

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,290
highlights that III noted I'm to call
