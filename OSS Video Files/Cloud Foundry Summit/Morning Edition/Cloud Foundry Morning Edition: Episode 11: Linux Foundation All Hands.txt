Description: 
	Welcome to the Cloud Foundry Morning Edition, Episode 11, Linux Foundation All Hands includes news about:

    Until now, only an administrator could register and update service brokers. This meant a normal user could not manage their own service brokers for their own team. This is no longer a limitation!
    Lattice news:
        “cf push” on Lattice!
        Windows support
        Brokered services can be BOSH-deployed with “special release” of Lattice
    The Linux Foundation All Hands with an introduction from Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation
    Meet the Cloud Foundry Foundation team:
        Sam Ramji, CEO

good morning and welcome to the Cloud

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,010
Foundry Morning Edition episode 11 Linux

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,710
Foundation all hands

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,240
my name is stormy Peters and I'm VP of

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,670
technical evangelism at the Cloud

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,830
Foundry foundation so today I'm gonna

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,330
give you a couple of pieces of pretty

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,890
big news and then I'm gonna introduce

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,470
you to the rest of the Cloud Foundry

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,029
foundation team as well as Jim's Emlyn

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,269
the executive director of the Lynx

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,670
foundation um so first the news so until

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,460
now only an administrator could register

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,680
an update service brokers and as of this

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,050
week according to news posted by dr.

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,780
Nick from Stark and Wayne a normal user

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,390
can now register and update their own

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,360
service brokers so this gives a lot more

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,670
power to Cloud Foundry application

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,000
developers not just administrators who

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,890
administer instances of Cloud Foundry so

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,809
awesome news the link is in the notes if

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,789
you want to read more about that the

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,010
other big news that we have this week is

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,899
in the latus project so I notes before

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,570
that we're pushing lattice as the way

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,549
for application developers to check out

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,640
Cloud Foundry so it's a way that you can

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,560
download some of the Cloud Foundry

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,750
functionality to your laptop and test it

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,189
out and it has a couple disadvantages

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,750
and that the UI is little different

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,040
functionality is the same but the UI is

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,140
a little different the branding is

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,540
obviously different but in the last

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,030
couple weeks there's been some changes

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,909
to lattice um so they're now adding the

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,810
CF push Mui and technologies lattice

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,509
which is huge

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,130
they've added Windows support and

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,960
they're now they're now adding some

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,790
Bosch support so brokerage service can

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,460
be brokered services can be bashed

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,130
deployed with the special release of

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,649
lattice so huge improvements to lattice

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,750
as a both as a product in and of itself

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,540
and as a way for our application

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,299
developers to test out the Cloud Foundry

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:54,840
functionality so huge improvements there

00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:57,570
are huge news there so this week the

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,100
Cloud Foundry foundation team was at the

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,840
Linux Foundation all hands so we're

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,420
actually a Linux Foundation project and

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,579
we use a lot of their resources like all

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,950
of our events are hosted by the Linux

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,349
Foundation events team we use their

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,240
their banking and financial services so

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,980
we our Linux Foundation project

00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,260
so along with a whole bunch of other

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,870
Linux foundation projects like 25 of

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,640
them we went to the Linux Foundation all

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,890
hands and I thought it was a great

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
opportunity to adduce you introduce you

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,150
to the whole team so what you're gonna

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,940
see is the rest of the cloud foundry

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,320
foundation team as well as Jim's Emlyn

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,740
from the Linux Foundation I'm

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,180
introducing themselves so here you go

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,120
I'm Jim Zelman I'm the executive

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,150
director of the Linux Foundation and I

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
am here to talk about cloud foundry so

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,300
one of the things that really impressed

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,490
me at the Linux Foundation all-hands was

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,630
how many different projects that are

00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,300
that are part of the Linux Foundation

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,100
that all work together and I'll

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,290
collaborate on a number of things like

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,090
events and how to attract developers and

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,100
how to do security and so I asked Jim

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,010
like how many projects are there so

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,770
we've got like 25 projects here so Linux

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:08,010
nodejs Bob boundary all-seeing which is

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,510
an IOT initiative OPN afiyah network

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,040
function virtualization effort

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,400
opendaylight a software-defined

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,650
networking project we have open

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,130
mainframe people here we have people who

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,200
work on drone code you know from

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,870
unmanned aerial vehicles to

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,970
platform-as-a-service and down to the

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,370
kernel everybody's here

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,530
jim was in on the very beginning like

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,970
when pivotal actually wanted to create a

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,800
Cloud Foundry foundation so that other

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,900
companies pick a library and they were

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,340
wondering where to where to house that

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,590
foundation how to create it

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,320
i'm jim was part of the quandary the

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,200
technology came out of an organization

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,080
called pivotal that I think people who

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,050
follow Cloud Foundry know well and

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,420
pivotal approached us to create

00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,420
neutral pen for Cloud Foundry us at the

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,390
foundation to create a neutral home for

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,690
Cloud Foundry so that they could invest

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:06,570
along with IBM s ap hewlett-packard and

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,960
the many many members who participate in

00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,550
cloud foundry at large scale so one of

00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,810
the questions that comes up is why is

00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,400
code foundry part of the Linux

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,230
Foundation like what's the benefit and

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,720
the benefit is often those pooled

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:21,690
resources between projects things like

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,030
events teams and finances and here the

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,770
five boundary folks wanted to create an

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,730
organization that would enable the

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,380
community to be led by people who are

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,150
professionals at creating big

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,730
communities around an open-source

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,160
project needed infrastructure to run the

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,280
development frameworks are used to

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,100
actually create the code they wanted

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,830
events to promote the project to bring

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,760
developers together they wanted kind of

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,070
all the things that the Linux Foundation

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,220
has been doing for a decade or more

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,690
with clinics and you essentially tap

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,610
into our expertise to grow the

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,520
organization they needed to hire people

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,260
quickly they needed to put money into a

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,990
bank account we have all those

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,110
capabilities so we were able to

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,490
essentially turnkey the effort with

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,280
Condrey and what we're doing here is

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,610
meeting to share best practices to get

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,460
to know each other you know each of our

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,590
projects has unique challenges to their

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,960
particular part of the technology stack

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,580
but they also have a lot of common

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,530
challenges around you know how to do

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,390
security policy how to develop a

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,860
community how to do a great developer

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,260
event you know how to manage

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,940
intellectual property and we're sharing

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,190
those ideas with each other all

00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,760
in maybe just getting to know each other

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,230
and having a good time so one of the

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,690
things that Jim Semillon did when

00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,670
pivotal approached him about hosting the

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,070
Cloud Foundry foundation is look for an

00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,140
executive director so he found Tim

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,710
Ramsey who agreed to serve as CEO and

00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,870
Sam and Jim worked things out about how

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,660
they would get started and what things

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,090
would look like um so here's Sam and and

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,550
Sam was really busy turning the

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,930
all-hands um so I didn't catch him at

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,540
the all-hands because he was busy

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,210
talking to other people giving talks I'm

00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:14,110
doing other things so here he is I'm

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:16,330
describing in his own words why now is

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,350
an important time in in

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,240
platform-as-a-service

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:22,060
and why quad foundry and open source

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,560
software project fits that needs the

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,940
fits that need and where we should go

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:30,580
from here hi I'm Sam Ramsay CEO cloud

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,880
foundry foundation cloud foundry is

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,220
focused on enabling rapid productivity

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,290
for developers for new applications and

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,290
portability of those applications across

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,000
any cloud environment the reason this is

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,470
really important is because the world

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,310
has shifted to cloud computing to deal

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:50,740
with all of the increased demands for

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,450
availability and service of applications

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,390
to devices all around the world

00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:57,280
accessible at any time by any number of

00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,860
people that requires what we call

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,080
elastic scalability means you have to be

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,700
able to serve more applications rapidly

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,870
or fewer in an unpredictable environment

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,820
cloud computing there's a great job of

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,130
taking care of that scale but what cloud

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,140
foundry provides is the ability to build

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,270
those apps rapidly and then move them

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,500
from one cloud to another so one day you

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,900
might be running them in your own data

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,660
center another you might be running them

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,380
in Amazon another you might running run

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,900
them on Azure

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,190
and really you might even want to run

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,280
them in all three places at the same

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:33,880
time recently I got the opportunity MIT

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,190
meet Tim savage of our mikuni they build

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,770
the infrastructure for a very high

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:42,010
performance environment which serves the

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,990
public good it's a program called comic

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,750
relief which has raised over a billion

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,490
pounds in

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,150
United Kingdom to be able to take care

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:54,300
of pretty basic needs pure water for

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:58,800
children in Africa basic food basic

00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,900
medicines they have one day a year when

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,230
they can actually serve their demands

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:07,110
they've got 364 days of almost no

00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,120
activity totally quiescent servers no

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,870
strain on their applications and then

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,230
about eight hours on the 365th day where

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,450
they have to raise on the order of 50 to

00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,700
100 million pounds no tolerance for

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,220
failure no tolerance for a lack of

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,440
scalability so the fact that they can do

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,610
that on Cloud Foundry and run on three

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,980
different environments at the same time

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,590
means they can serve the public good and

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,979
do so while getting portability across

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,010
all their clouds so that's my favorite

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,440
story about CF and invite you to take a

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:43,020
look at Cloud Foundry org and learn more

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,610
about what we do and next up is Mike

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,110
Mamie who leads our communication and

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,740
branding effort my name my name is Mike

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:52,350
meny I lead branding and communications

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,940
for the Cloud Foundry foundation and I

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,230
asked Mike what he did every day which

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,850
proved to be a hard question for

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,420
everybody it's different every day right

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:02,880
and we're one of the roles that I have

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,230
is to make sure that the values and the

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,940
culture that we put on paper is actually

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,970
exhibited and through programs and

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,380
through the people and the and the

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,290
products and the efforts that we use

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,060
across the foundation and you probably

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,190
saw our new brand over the last couple

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,620
weeks it's this beautiful new logo of

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,560
like molten metal pouring into like a

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,630
cogwheel and also the the ninja rabbit

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,880
or the engineer rabbit or whichever

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,430
version of the rabbit you want to use

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,589
for community so I asked Mike how we

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,170
went about creating that when we set out

00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,930
to create the new brand I actually had a

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,839
full head of hair and it was a long

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,790
process we did a lot of global testing

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,640
we worked with a great firm small firm

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,080
that had very similar values to us out

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,000
of Portsmouth New Hampshire called vital

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,030
design and they did an outstanding job

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,710
of polling the community talking to a

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,140
lot of our stakeholders

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,470
and in really understanding what the

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,899
Cloud Foundry brand was and they

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,990
translated that into a tremendous new

00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:11,640
logo a new visual identity and a website

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:13,529
for the for the for the community and

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,750
then Mike did a great job of expressing

00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,930
what we're all working on Cloud Foundry

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,870
and open-source software project that is

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:24,930
a platform as a service done by

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,120
community with community with companies

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:30,360
and individuals working together this is

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,850
a great organization this is being

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,620
bigger than the actual products that we

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,200
sell right because that's one of the

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,200
things that this Linux Foundation and

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,120
the Cloud Foundry brand is about right

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,300
it's not about just the code it's not it

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,920
just it's not about the the projects

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,270
it's about the people behind them it's

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,360
about the people that build it the

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,680
people that were serving and that is

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,880
what I'm really thinking about right now

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,420
this week next up is Liza Frank who is

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,000
Sam Ramsey's executive assistant

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:06,029
hey I'm Liza and I am the executive

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,570
assistant to Sam Ramsey's CEO of the

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:11,370
Cloud Foundry foundation Liza like many

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,650
others also struggled to like to find

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,990
what we do in one day in a couple of

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,839
minutes on a video oh my god there's so

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:21,029
much on a daily basis and they asked

00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,120
Liza how working at Cloud Foundry

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:25,860
compared to other jobs that she'd had

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,890
yes super interesting is completely

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:33,060
different in the world that I used to I

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:34,980
I used to come from a tech and so this

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,060
is just it's so nice to be able to work

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,550
with people do something good and

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:44,520
[Music]

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:47,590
worth while I love my job

00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:50,350
next up is Jill Baxter who leads our PR

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,820
efforts hi my name is Jill Backstrom and

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,870
I'm the PR manager for Cloud Foundry

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,670
foundation so Jill's doing PR for an

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,340
open-source software foundation and

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,110
she's working with 53 member companies

00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,580
all over to have their own PR team so

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,710
after what that was great to work with

00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,330
open source PR because we really are in

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,860
a situation where when we're talking to

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,920
reporters and analysts we're talking

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,360
about how about changing the industry

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,740
when we're talking to them we don't get

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,120
the sense that they're trying to give us

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,310
a vendor that we're giving a vendor

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,080
pitch or trying to sell a product they

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,880
really it's an opportunity for us to

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,260
really start talking about technology

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,050
and how we're changing industry so

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,210
that's pretty exciting I thought and

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,290
then I asked Jill where she lives or

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,530
what she does when she's not doing

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,510
laundry stuff I live on a small farm in

00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:39,690
Colorado so when I'm not doing

00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:44,320
technology PR I am mucking stalls and

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:46,240
milking goats next up is Devin Davis who

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,160
runs our marketing efforts my name is

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,180
Devin Davis and I run marketing and

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,370
operations for the Cloud Foundry

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,540
foundation job it's everything from

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,910
making sure that our marketing working

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,970
group is coordinating properly to making

00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:00,160
sure that we're working together on

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,710
things like certification and other

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,970
important projects to making sure that

00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:09,250
our summits run smoothly and getting us

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,290
all the work together as a team and I

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,670
asked Devin what was top of mind this

00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,140
week and of course he answered the

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,210
answer that you just all know from the

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,540
past previous Cloud Foundry morning

00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:23,110
edition's Cloud Foundry summit Shanghai

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,190
coming in Westmont that depends have you

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,660
bought your tickets for Shanghai summit

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,950
yeah you should buy your tickets for

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,560
Shanghai summit it's gonna be awesome

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,500
it's December 2nd and 3rd it's in

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,050
Shanghai so it's not just a clever name

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,550
and the goal is is really to get the the

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,840
Asia community in the China community

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,240
around Cloud Foundry together in one

00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,240
place so that we can all talk about our

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,890
successes and what we can all do better

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,410
and it has Devin what it was like to

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,490
work with 53 member companies because I

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,740
think in marketing it's even more

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,660
um more interesting than in some other

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,980
efforts because everyone does marketing

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,920
a little cool because we work with

00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,839
companies that have a ton of history

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,310
like IBM that are big important

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,020
companies and we work with small

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,910
important companies like iron I oh there

00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,870
recently just joined who are doing

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,360
really interesting things from a

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:11,240
technology perspective and so we get the

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,670
full gamut of the the marketing

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,470
playhouse we get to pretend we're

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,860
startup and we get to get to pretend

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:21,279
we're a major multinational corporation

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:24,080
next up is Scotland's and who leads our

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,540
our ecosystem efforts so he works with a

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,190
lot of user companies to figure out how

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,040
we can best engage them and make sure

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,560
that foundry my name is Scott Munson and

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,320
I head up ecosystems for the Cloud

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:39,440
Foundry foundation and I asked Scott

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,390
what did that effort look like major

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,940
focus is actually on helping user

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,850
companies engage with the foundation we

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,279
have a super powerful foundation already

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:51,050
built foundation from like a technical

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,870
perspective of the best cloud providers

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:56,899
in the world the biggest and the economy

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,339
is going to grow by us getting end users

00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:00,470
more engaged and making sure that we're

00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:02,899
building platforms designed for vertical

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,149
markets and one of the things that Scott

00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:08,390
does is lead six special interest groups

00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:11,450
which a really fascinating way of

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,579
figuring out how to include people how

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,370
to include industries and companies that

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,020
don't necessarily traditionally have a

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,440
lot of developers to put on the project

00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:24,470
a cig is basically a special interest

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,120
group it's basically a foundational

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,700
service a complementary one that we

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,829
provide it's open to anyone that's

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,329
really a user of Cloud Foundry right so

00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:35,420
we have members and we have non-members

00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:38,540
that join the objective of the SIG's are

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,820
to get everybody together and to look at

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,620
the vertical market in which they they

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:48,529
play and try to come up with

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,930
requirements desires software that they

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:53,720
might need etc so that we can build a

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,700
unified voice and bring that back to the

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,930
project teams the project management

00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,320
committees that are building Cloud

00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,750
Foundry

00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,900
and make sure that the user voice is

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,810
well understood within those products

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,370
and then in the end those requirements

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,200
they want get into the upstream project

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,880
and since we are doing certified

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,380
versions of Cloud Foundry certified

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,690
products require the use of upstream

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,279
projects so it's a cycle that enables

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,500
them to have a voice back into the

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,779
foundation and into the project without

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,170
actually having a lot of contributors

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:25,839
working on the project and last but not

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,700
least for today is chip Childers who

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,770
leads our technology efforts

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:33,430
so chip Childers vice president of

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:35,890
technology for the foundation and as

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,570
chip what he does day-to-day and he

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,160
managed to summarize a whole bunch of

00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,720
work that I think he knows in just a few

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,180
seconds so I think it will bring him on

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,310
later and get you some more detail on

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,110
how dojos work and how contributions to

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,520
the project works but for now here's

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,960
your son actually responsible for

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,420
working with all of the various vendors

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,240
that are contributing a lot of the users

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,160
and the different special interest

00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,600
groups making sure the requirements are

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,700
flowing and effectively to the projects

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,960
that the projects are operating that

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,820
they're operating in the inclusive way

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,160
I'll spend a lot of time working on the

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,360
dojo program to bring in new

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,730

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,949
