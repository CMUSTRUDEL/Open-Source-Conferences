good morning good afternoon good evening

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,390
and welcome to the Cloud Foundry Morning

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,309
Edition bringing you all your Cloud

00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,900
Foundry news of last week and what's

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,420
coming up in this week

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,830
my name is stormy Peters and I'm VP of

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,500
technical evangelism at the Cloud

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,690
Foundry foundation welcome to episode 7

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,550
of the Cloud Foundry Morning Edition I'm

00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,900
also really excited to tell you that you

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,820
can watch this on YouTube which is

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,740
probably how you're watching it but you

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,800
can now also subscribe to this as a

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,950
podcast from iTunes from stitcher from

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,020
pocket casts so if you would rather get

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,969
your Cloud Foundry update while you're

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,530
mowing the lawn or driving to work or

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,079
doing your morning run you can now do

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,370
that um so go check that out give me a

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,850
feedback let me know if anything needs

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:51,390
to be fixed this episode is episode 7

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,430
and it is like the day of big news where

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,399
other people's products are integrating

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,829
into Cloud Foundry so the really big one

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,590
that you probably saw is from 18f which

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,750
is a US government organization and they

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,249
have built a whole product along with

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,670
the whole website and a bunch of really

00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:10,409
awesome documentation at cloud gov so

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,929
it's like the US government's website

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,369
cloud gov if you go to doc stock cloud

00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:16,950
gov you can see all the documentation

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,319
and what they've done is create a cloud

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,119
found a cloud instance for all

00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,189
government agencies that want to create

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,950
cloud apps and it's all based on Cloud

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,409
Foundry and you can go there to see how

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,340
they set it up all the documentation you

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,249
would need if you're a government

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,169
organization to run an app on it they

00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:36,599
have a DevOps public slack channel that

00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:38,549
you can join and ask questions and all

00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,289
of its all of its public domain because

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,849
anything that the US government

00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:43,739
employees creates is automatically in

00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:45,599
the public domain so really awesome

00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,549
stuff there go check it out

00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,380
we're also talking about coding I'm with

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,729
them a government mailing list and and

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,369
perhaps a sake or something like that

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,679
because we now have the US government UK

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,689
government and the Korean government all

00:01:55,679 --> 00:02:00,239
creating cloud platforms for their

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,369
citizens and their agencies using open

00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,359
source software Cloud Foundry totally

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,649
awesome other big news that came out

00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,090
this week that I don't really have

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,909
probably more updates than you've read

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,709
in the news but Dell is going to acquire

00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,640
EMC here that's what they announced

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,600
intentions of

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,220
yesterday or today we nothing will

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,430
change in the next six months probably

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,020
but the EMC CEO has said that VMware and

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,280
pivotal and a lot of the Cloud Foundry

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,530
stuff I assume that's in those

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,480
organizations and will continue his plan

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,550
to be a moral continued public he said

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,710
and pivotal will continue on its track

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,840
to be public but hopefully we'll see

00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,040
Cloud Foundry used in even more of

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,930
Dell's solutions which would be really

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,150
awesome so stay tuned there I don't have

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,910
any insider information but what I do

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,230
find out I will share whatever I can I

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,580
don't expect to have any insider

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:53,190
information and then IBM also announced

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,739
some better debugging for node.js so if

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,030
you use node.js in cloud foundry um they

00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,709
have some awesome tools that they put

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,680
out so you can go to a developer that I

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:04,050
am calm to see that and then talking

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,880
about people releasing stuff to make

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,670
their products and services work better

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,680
with cloud foundry TIBCO announced that

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,830
they put out some build packs that let

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,760
TIBCO users deploy their TIBCO

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,500
applications

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,080
I might not quite have that quite right

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,299
on to Cloud Foundry so they have a build

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,670
pack that's why there are work awesome

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,200
so I think it also shows the power of

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,660
build packs so it shows that you can

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,910
make a build pack for Cloud Foundry very

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,430
easily it makes it easy for a group of

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,380
application developers to use Cloud

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,660
Foundry that I happen to know very much

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,140
at all about cloud foundry itself so

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,610
really empowering developers and

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,280
applications users to do really awesome

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,519
things I'm along those same lines

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,310
Appaji announced that um so a pudgy is

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,260
like an API platform and they announced

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,860
that they worked with pivotal to make

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,950
the API

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,410
Appaji API platform available to cloud

00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,910
foundry pivotal cloud foundry users so

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,400
pivotal cloud foundry users who are

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,430
building applications can now expose

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,170
things in their applications through API

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,910
is using the apogee product so that's

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,500
really awesome - I've been having a lot

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,299
of fun playing with api's in the last

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,790
week they've gotten much much easier to

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,979
use just a little bit of scripting or

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,720
coding or even just using URLs you can

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,609
pull like some really awesome data from

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,190
things so like last week I talked about

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,620
I pull I figured I had a poll a bunch of

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,090
meetup information out of meetup calm

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,830
through the api's

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,770
and I'll share some more data from that

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,440
later and then this week I played with

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,750
github and pulling github information

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,310
from the github API and it's really

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,620
amazing the things you can pull out and

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,440
other things you can add and tweak and

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,470
change and have great fun with so why

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,030
was our playing with github API so I'm

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,820
running the technical evangelism efforts

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,310
at Cloud Foundry and we know that most

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,260
people that use Cloud Foundry first want

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,180
to try it out so have a great big

00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,520
organization thinking about moving to

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,680
cloud foundry somebody that works in dev

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,570
ops or ite or the application group

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,970
wants to download it and try it out

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,729
themselves and unless you have like a

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,740
super duper computer or laptop

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:12,389
downloading Cloud Foundry can take a lot

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,400
we know it takes at least 45 minutes

00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:15,330
from our to the dock sprint but we also

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,450
know that you have to have a certain

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,550
amount of memory to install it so we

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,520
want to promote lattice and lattice is a

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,800
set of the cloud foundry features that

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,169
shows you all the power of managing and

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,970
scheduling your containers but it runs

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,770
easily on a laptop and it's set up so

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,350
that you can use it easily for one

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,300
person or small teams so we want to

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,430
promote lattice as the entry point for

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,750
people exploring cloud flenders so we

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,430
think if a lot of users would go up it

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,200
means cloud foundry users will go up um

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,450
so we're gonna start measuring lattices

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,039
are metric so is playing with github to

00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,669
see how many downloads of lattice we've

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,300
had so far

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:53,430
how many Watchers how many you know how

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,919
many people watching it like starring it

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,020
and we're putting out some information

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,910
about if you want to talk about Cloud

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,340
Foundry or get more people involved I'm

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,580
how you can demo lattice slides that you

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,820
can include when and where you should be

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,680
using it so stay tuned for that and then

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,940
speaking of meetups that I also got from

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,669
the API um tomorrow August October 15

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,039
14th October 14th there are actually

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:22,560
seven meetups tomorrow around the world

00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,210
so if you live in Colorado you can go

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
isn't a Home Depot speak if you're in

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,590
Montreal you have a meet-up if you're in

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,760
Paris there's an IBM bluemix meetup if

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,410
you're in Dublin there's a meet-up

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,850
and if you're an agent we don't leave

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,870
you out so there's Manila and Vietnam

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,039
and Seoul all have meetups tomorrow and

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,720
then they think there's like two or

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,400
three the next day and still a couple of

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,130
the next day so

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,060
this is the week of meetups so if you

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:49,520
live in South America or kind of think

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,880
of what continent mr. Africa or

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,110
Antarctica you should or Australia you

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,690
should set up a meet up for tomorrow

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,590
because you're missing out so join one

00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,870
of the love meetups

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,280
near you or call up your friends and

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,100
have them mean up at the bar happy to

set you guys up with if you can speak

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,050
and happy to support you in your efforts

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,699
to promote lattice so if you need money

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,289
for pizza and beer give me a call if

00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,660
you're promoting lattice I'd love to

00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:17,060
support you so I have a great week stay

00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,940
tuned there's a lot of huge news this

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:25,789
week between 18f apogee emc TIBCO

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,220
Dell and EMC and I look forward to what

00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:30,350
next week brings so you are listening to

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,840
the Cloud Foundry Morning Edition and
