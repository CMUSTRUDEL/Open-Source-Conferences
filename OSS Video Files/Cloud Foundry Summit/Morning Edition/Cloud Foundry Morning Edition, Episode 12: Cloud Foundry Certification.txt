good morning and welcome to Cloud

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,069
Foundry Morning Edition episode 12 all

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,230
about Cloud Foundry certification

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,639
my name is stormy Peters and then VP of

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,859
technical evangelism at the Cloud

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,420
Foundry foundation good morning and

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,240
welcome to Cloud Foundry Morning Edition

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,279
episode 12 there has been a lot

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,710
happening lately perhaps seen in the

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,269
news I think the very big news that

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,880
happened this week is cloud foundry

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,279
certification and so cloud foundry is an

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,200
open-source software project and as you

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,750
know anyone can take and edit open

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,100
source software packet projects packaged

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,410
them with whatever proprietary software

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,239
they want and ship it and with cloud

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,059
foundry we want to make sure that it's

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,460
an industry standard that users can rely

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,170
on and that they can use cloud foundry

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,700
from any provider or the open source

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,280
software version without having to do

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,629
humongous important efforts so we're

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,760
really proud to announce that we have

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,350
cloud foundry certification and that we

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,660
have a number of providers who are on

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,719
board from the very beginning so

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,320
CenturyLink Hewlett Packard Enterprise

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,430
Huawei IBM pivotal sa P Swiss come have

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,860
all announced that they're shipping

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,990
certified Cloud Foundry so this is a

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,119
really awesome move for the industry and

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,860
I also think it's a it's a new approach

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,509
for open source software so we'll see

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,400
where we go from here there's been lots

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,130
of news I will point to a bunch of links

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,439
in the blog but this is this is really

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,070
good news both for the project for the

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,420
providers and definitely for the users

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,750
the other really big news that perhaps

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,400
you also saw was that we had our cloud

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,920
foundry summit in Asia this was the

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,720
third one of the year in our effort to

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,310
go around the globe and we held it in

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,530
Shanghai which is absolutely gorgeous

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,909
City I grabbed a little bit about the

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,409
pollution but in the end when Ike

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,570
returned back to Colorado it turns out

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,689
we also have pollution gorgeous city we

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:56,610
had 470 people signed up for the event

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:57,990
packed house the plenaries were full the

00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,790
breakout sessions a lot of them had

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,040
standing room only there was an awesome

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,170
hallway track where you saw people

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,149
discussing Cloud Foundry and seeing

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,940
demos and really making progress on

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,080
things we had a training before the

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,300
event started

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,580
and the training was full completely

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,740
everyone had signed up completely full

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,660
and we still had way more people that

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,340
wanted to attend they were in trying to

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,530
sneak in during the breaks and stuff so

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,260
definitely an appetite for quandary

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,120
there and not just an appetite to use it

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,520
but people actually using it so there

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,230
are a number of talks from local

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,870
companies and educational institutions

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,880
in China who are already using Cloud

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,730
Foundry contributing to it um so one of

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,750
the more interesting ones was um

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,760
Shanghai University University of

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,470
Shanghai I was working on smart cities

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,910
and then they give a talk and what was

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,910
really cool about the conference is that

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,610
we had simultaneously interpreters

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,860
during all of the sessions so if the

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,209
speaker was speaking in English um you

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,620
could listen on your headphones in

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,600
Chinese and they were speaking in

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,110
Chinese I'm you could listen in English

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,430
and Jill who's our peer person actually

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,050
said that like it was funny she was in

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,240
the in the talk where the speaker was

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,250
speaking in English and then they switch

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,350
to the speaker switched and they speak

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,610
to Chinese and the people sitting in

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,959
mixture actually took their headsets off

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,250
and handed them to her so they were

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,920
sharing headsets as they went back and

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,690
forth I'm so awesome great event look

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,600
forward to going back there again I'm

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,920
definitely a great appetite for it there

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,090
I'm supposed to really two big news that

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,570
I wanted to talk about was a

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,280
certification and the China summit we

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,959
also have some other news so that the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,570
slack channels where you can find a lot

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,790
of the clot founders hanging out and it

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,080
has been open to everybody if you are

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,640
Claud found remember and how to clap

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,350
fund remember email address it was easy

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,120
to sign up we just made it easy for

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,100
everybody to sign up so the tools team

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,459
actually worked on it if you go to slack

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,989
Cloud Foundry org you can actually just

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,780
sign up for the stock panel so hope to

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,100
see a lot of you there I'm asking and

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,340
answering questions and helping

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,370
contribute to the project there was also

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,340
a lot of technical news this week if you

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,110
don't attend the Cloud Foundry advisory

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,550
board meetings and you're interested in

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,590
the project is a technical level they're

00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,720
a great place to listen in it's an hour

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,880
a month and it's really where all the

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,620
projects give their updates and there's

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,540
some discussion about roadmaps and how

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,220
projects fit together I'm so a great

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,630
thing to attend if you're interested in

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,500
following the project from a technical

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,270
level and the

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,950
a tourist has just picked at the meeting

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,290
minutes so if you goes out tourist blog

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,290
you can see their meeting minutes there

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,580
some of the things that happened you

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,650
know there's so there was updates from

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,440
all their projects like see if release

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,020
Diego Bosh garden build packs and they

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,700
talked about some work at the CLI they

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,130
talked about pivotal withdrawing from

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,920
lattice so we probably won't see a lot

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,420
of more features or improvements made to

00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,200
lattice and while somebody else wants to

00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,770
pick that up

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,140
I'm just evey reminder lattice was the

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,610
kind of the laptop version of cloud

00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,740
fenders how I'd like to think about it

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,630
it gave people a feel for how Cloud

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,210
Foundry worked but in a package they

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,850
could install on their laptop um and

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,640
then like the logger Gator on team well

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,050
Jim Campbell from the lager Gator team

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,470
and I was their roadmap and solicited

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,000
feedback

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,770
Ethan believed he also posted that on

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,600
the CF dev mailing list so you could

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,850
catch it there too I'm such as all the

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,380
teams come and give updates another

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,570
piece of news I don't think I mentioned

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,480
there but it was on the mesosphere blog

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:27,780
is that um there's now Cloud Foundry my

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,880
sauce which let's let's let's users of

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,740
the missiles platform it gives them an

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,200
option for running their cloud native

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,550
apps in a single reliable environment of

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,919
Cloud Foundry so basically what they did

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,110
is they took Cloud Foundry and replaced

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,510
Diego with some a so stuff I mean so now

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,310
you can use Cloud Foundry within May so

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,620
it's kind of cool you should check that

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,290
out too I have them the links to that is

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,600
also in the minutes the meetups continue

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,790
to be really awesome and we still have

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,970
170 something meetups around the world

00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:59,040
meetup calm my mind their their data

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,200
through api's to pull out the data and

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,400
their data pulls out cities so I had my

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,290
nine year olds go through all the cities

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,169
and identify which country the city was

00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,300
in and I checked his work and there are

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,520
Cloud Foundry meetups in 48 countries

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,680
worldwide so no matter where you live

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,270
there is probably a cloud foundry meetup

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,400
near you

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,220
the a couple big ones that are happening

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,340
is the Silicon Valley users group is

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,340
having a holiday party tomorrow Thursday

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,020
I believe on the 17th and it's called CF

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,130
beat you are all welcome they'll be

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,349
speakers from the foundation and

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,849
promoters from other places there as

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,340
well as cocktails or whatever you have

00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:36,620
at a holiday party

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,320
and then the London group is having a

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,360
meet up early next year and they are

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,460
going to invite a bunch of the speakers

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,890
from Cloud Foundry summit Berlin and

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,270
Cloud Foundry to summit Shanghai

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,070
including like a couple of my favorite

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,960
keynotes from Berlin and they're going

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,060
to record those talks at the meetup so

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,920
if you can go to the meetup awesome

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,230
it'll be it'll be a great performance

00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,430
and if you can't they'll be posted on

00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,930
the cliff and your YouTube channel

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,490
afterwards so and then I'll all sorts of

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,550
little updates that I could also give

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,660
you um we have a new t-shirts for meetup

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,760
so if you're running a meetup and you

00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,530
looking for people that blog on the

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,910
Cloud Foundry org blog and I've heard

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,170
that it's kind of intimidating and

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,700
people think they need to write at white

00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,290
paper or they need to have developed a

00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,150
new feature for Cloud Foundry I'm

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,240

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,920
300 to 500 word blog posts about

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,110
something you're working on or way you

00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,330
used Cloud Foundry would love to have a

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,340

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,400

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,750
huge evolution of how open source

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,120
in the way that keeps the whole

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,440
ecosystem very vibrant so you've been

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,660
