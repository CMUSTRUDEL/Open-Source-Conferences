good morning and welcome to the Cloud

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,020
Foundry Morning Edition

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,340
my name is stormy Peters and I'm VP of

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,889
technical evangelism at the Cloud

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,450
Foundry Foundation first off I wanted to

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,910
say thanks to everyone who sent in news

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,350
this week that's awesome and so anybody

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,789
else who has news that would like to

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,720
submit it for this weekly update feel

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,060
free to email me

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,340
I am stormy at Cloud Foundry org I'm

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,410
even better yet bonus points if you send

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,930
me a 30-second video of yourself telling

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,090
us your news or even like a screencast

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,309
if it's a tool and I will include it

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,780
that is if my video editing skills can

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,579
can live up to the task but I'm pretty

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,770
sure I can handle it so if you have news

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,510
either send it to me an email or send me

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,940
a clip of yourself talking about it or

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,920
showing it um so what's happened this

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,780
week in Cloud Foundry I'm so big news

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,690
the Korean government has joined the

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,129
cloud condor foundation they have

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,129
selected Cloud Foundry to be their

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,260
primary government platform the news was

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,289
broken in Korean so I think it's on

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,789
ZDNet you can go there and maybe you can

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,020
use Google Translate like I did and you

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,000
can kind of get the general feel for

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,530
what the news says look for more news

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,159
later this week

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,200
I would assume other news there was a

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,680
new tool release called subway by stark

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,270
and Wayne

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,040
they've been maintaining this this

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,810
feature set for a while and have

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,270
released it as a tool called subway and

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,549
it's basically a service broker that

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,900
allows you to horizontally scale service

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,810
brokers that don't allow horizontal

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,920
scaling so if you have that problem if

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,630
you're trying to use a service broker

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,880
that doesn't scale horizontally is this

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,229
an awesome tool for you it's also an

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,240
open-source software project so you can

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,119
go download it play with it contribute

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,869
to it if you use it and check it out

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,790
on other news um toros who does a lot of

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,439
good training already is now launching a

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,020
new webinar series on how to implement

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,570
cloud foundry their first one will be on

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,759

HANA cloud platform does and is and how

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,310
it will leverage cloud foundry and

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,600
OpenStack I'm so some really good info

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,180

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,160
what's available I'm speaking of the

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,510
quad founder summit don't forget that

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,700
the cloud founder summit Europe is

happening November 2nd and 3rd in Berlin

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,360
thank you so much to everyone who

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,100
outstanding number of really record

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,560
proposals fortunately or unfortunately

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,910
there's no way we could possibly accept

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,400
all of them I think we're looking like a

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,800
10% acceptance rate and we had so many

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,810
awesome proposals so I can guarantee you

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,820
that if you go to the summit the agenda

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,830
will be awesome because we have a super

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,770
good pool of talks to pull from so thank

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,090
you everybody who submitted them and you

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,440
should submit those proposals and then

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,780
the other ones you have to the Cloud

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,580
Foundry summit in China and that call

they'll be a three-day extension I

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,560
didn't say that though and so please

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,209
submit your talks there as a reminder

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,650
the three themes that we're looking for

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,620
that we think will be really useful to

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,730
the audience in those locations and to

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,160
the people that will travel to those

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,959
locations our business transformation

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,550
stories so any way that you've used Cod

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,430
foundries successfully in your business

00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:44,010
and change things anything that's useful

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,410
to application developers so like api's

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,300
or toolsets that you use and then any

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,459
kind of war stories or tips and tricks

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,610

$700 round-trip from Denver in economy

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,080
which is gonna be a long trip but $700

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,210

community um other things that happened

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,660
there's a new project

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,130
oing out the the PMC the PMC's are the

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,920
project management councils where they

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,140
they decide what's happening at the

00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,660
technical level mint project and they

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,330
created a new repository called PMC note

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,440
and you can follow a PMC note and find

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,990
out what is happening because that's

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,400
where they submit either the minutes

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,900
from their meeting if they meet

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,590
regularly like once a week or every

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,720
other week

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,340
and if they do if it's a group that

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,680
doesn't meet project that doesn't meet

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,330
regularly they just submit their updates

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,340
and write so you can follow all the

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:19,080
Cloud Foundry projects by following PMC

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:21,960
note other projects um Josh from pivotal

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,280
um forgetting his last name one of the

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,360
Josh's from pivotal in the blue there's

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,120
two talked typed at the at the cod

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,090
advisor have foundation advisory board

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,250
meeting about Cloud Foundry system

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,770
certification and accreditation so

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,780
there's a lot of people in Washington DC

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,070
and Wall Street that are using cloud

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,920
foundry and

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,320
so there's a lot of effort going into

00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,970
what it what we can do to certify it and

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,090
that credit it from like a government

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,530
type you know regulation type

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,300
perspective and so there's a repository

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,010
for that project that you can check out

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,350
and you can contribute to it

00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,240
the GSA and other government

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,860
organizations are contributing to it so

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,850
if that's an area that you have interest

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,470
in please go check it out they they're

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,790
currently doing it and markdown but

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,130
they're considering an another tool that

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,030
I forgot what it's called but that's

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,850
interesting cuz if you have our

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,250
preference you should go go talk to them

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,630
you know during the conversation because

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,550
it's approach that might be adopted by

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:23,850
other open-source software projects so

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,490
right now HUD foundry is looking at how

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,410
do we document C&C before this happened

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,360
this documentation needs to happen

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,890
completely privately completely behind

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,140
closed doors even for open source

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,270
software projects so we believe this is

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,980
one of the very first times that this

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,960
accreditation and certification process

00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,240
is being created in the open by a group

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,490
of people both the contributors to the

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,810
project and the users of it and we know

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,000
that there's other projects already

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,680
looking at this process and planning to

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,900
adopt it if they can like Code for

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,000
America so if you are either involved in

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,350
Cloud Foundry with Wall Street or the

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,880
government or at another open source

00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,530
software project that needs

00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,680
accreditation and this is something

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,530
interesting to follow and then another

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,930
update also from cab from the the Weiser

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,980
board meeting is the seat I think this

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,100
is interesting it wasn't so much a

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,690
technical update as um it was a how we

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,340
work and so one of the things that I

00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,110
find really fascinating about cut

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,650
foundry is the pair programming model

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,090
and so the CLI team has been working on

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,680
how do you set up teams that are

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,170
distributed so how do you partner

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,480
someone that's in California was some of

00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,650
them an East Coast or in Europe and so

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,810
they've been looking at what it means to

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,250
be a distributed contributor and how to

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,960
ramp up new users when they're not

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,690
sitting in the same office so if that's

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,610
interesting to you there are a team to

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,729
follower to watch because probably the

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,050
other teams will be following their lead

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,820
so with that that's what I have to share

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,470
with you today um please don't forget to

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,570
submit your talks for Shanghai or about

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,060
your ticket $700 from Denver a round

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,950
trip and send me your updates and send

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,970
them in video format so it can practice

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,129
and play

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,720
and see what we could create as a as a

00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:59,459
team Cloud Foundry Morning Edition

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,050
so with that I will wrap up this edition

00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:03,240
of the Cloud Foundry morning edition

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,110
have a great week and I will see you

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,889
again next week live from the docs print

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,889
