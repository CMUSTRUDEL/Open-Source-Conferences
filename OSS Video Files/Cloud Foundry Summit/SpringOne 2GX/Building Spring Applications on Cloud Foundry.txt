Speaker: Josh Long and Andy Piper
Let's face it, the cloud is here to stay. The cloud's potential can seem sometimes overwhelming, but it doesn't have to if you use Spring. Spring - and the various Spring projects - already embrace the architecture characteristics that make for great, cloud-centric applications in any environment. While Spring works well on any cloud platform, it enjoys a special place in the sun on Cloud Foundry, the open source PaaS from Pivotal.

In this talk, join Andy Piper as he introduces how to build Spring applications that work well in the cloud and on Cloud Foundry in particular. We'll cover how to consume services with Spring on Cloud Foundry, how to scale out using RabbitMQ and Spring Integration, how to use standalone processes and RabbitMQ for better batch processing, and discuss strategies for exposing and consuming services in a RESTful service-based cloud architecture.
