Title: Navigating the Software Wilderness, with Michael Keeling (C&S Architecture)
Publication date: 2019-02-26
Playlist: Software Architecture
Description: 
	Over time, even modestly large or complex software systems can become an untamed wilderness. Anyone who dares venture into one of these wild systems can quickly become entangled in the serpentine vines of past design decisions, sliced by the razor-sharp barbs of hidden assumptions, and lost in a labyrinth of code and documentation. Software architects can help their teams navigate this harsh landscape by creating cognitive landmarks that can be used as reference points and by building trails other designers can follow. In this talk we’ll explore techniques for creating architectural landmarks in the code, in documentation, and even in the physical workspace, that your fellow developers can use to navigate the wilds of your software system.
