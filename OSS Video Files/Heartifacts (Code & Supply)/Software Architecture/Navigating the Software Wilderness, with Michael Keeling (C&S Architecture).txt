Title: Navigating the Software Wilderness, with Michael Keeling (C&S Architecture)
Publication date: 2019-02-26
Playlist: Software Architecture
Description: 
	Over time, even modestly large or complex software systems can become an untamed wilderness. Anyone who dares venture into one of these wild systems can quickly become entangled in the serpentine vines of past design decisions, sliced by the razor-sharp barbs of hidden assumptions, and lost in a labyrinth of code and documentation. Software architects can help their teams navigate this harsh landscape by creating cognitive landmarks that can be used as reference points and by building trails other designers can follow. In this talk we’ll explore techniques for creating architectural landmarks in the code, in documentation, and even in the physical workspace, that your fellow developers can use to navigate the wilds of your software system.

MICHAEL KEELING is a software engineer at LendingHome, formerly in the Watson Group at IBM. He is the author of "Design It! From Programmer to Software Architect". Keeling has a master’s degree in software engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and a bachelor’s degree in computer science from the College of William and Mary.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,909
right so my name is Michael Keeling

00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,650
we're gonna talk a little bit today

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,589
about finding your way in the software

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:11,110
wilderness and I want to use this as

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,600
kind of this idea of like moving

00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:18,520
a metaphor for exploring some some big

00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,290
ideas with how we do that okay so yeah

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,939
so I mean every software system that we

00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,910
built basically turns into a gnarly

00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:27,279
nasty funky jungle with like Barb's and

00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,500
you know vines and traps and probably

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,439
Tigers and all kinds of stuff spread

00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,989
throughout the place yet somehow at

00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,460
least some people are able to are able

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:38,050
to kind of find their way through this

00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,600
jungle and they're actually able to be

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,150
quite successful even though it's a kind

00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,080
of gnarled mess even this picture it's

00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,239
kind of interesting because you can kind

00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,620
of see perhaps there's like a trail here

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,040
that somebody laid at some point or that

00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,210
that was created over time and so yeah

00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,559
there there are paths through these

00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,479
jungles and we're gonna talk about some

00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:00,339
ways that that we can move through them

00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,780
yeah why are some people this isn't

00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:03,309
displaying here for some reason which is

00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,600
kind of a bummer but why are some people

00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:08,799
better at navigating through these

00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,060
software systems and others okay so a

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,049
little bit of context which I think

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,090
we've already talked a little bit about

00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:16,150
that I am working at lending home

00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:19,180
currently I did write a book on software

00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,430
design and probably for the past seven

00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,320
years or so I was working at IBM which

00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,250
is where most of the stories and things

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,420
I'm going to talk about tonight are

00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,730
gonna be coming from so let's see here

00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,960
yeah there's also some a lot of the

00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,420
ideas from tonight you can find in the

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,880
book as well and then I guess as far as

00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,060
like training and things like that

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,500
I come from Carnegie Mellon which is I

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,710
don't know where a lot of the software

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:48,670
architecture types of ideas we're kind

00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:50,770
of codified initially so that's a little

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,690
bit about me and what we're gonna do

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,670
tonight is explore this hypothesis so

00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,250
humans navigate through abstract

00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,560
landscapes using a similar kind of

00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,330
cognitive approach as what they would

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,460
use through a physical landscape so the

00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,620
way we move through the world okay in

00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,110
the real world we can use similar

00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:12,040
strategies or similar ideas to apply to

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,510
software okay and to kind of answer that

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,760
hypothesis two questions we're going to

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,950
go through for this talk how do people

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,660
do that and then once we kind of figure

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,140
out how people do that what does that

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,640
mean for software okay all right so

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,530
let's uh let's dive into this first one

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,049
here

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,370
working so the big question so when

00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,389
you're going from point A to point B so

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,829
when you were traveling here from

00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:34,329
wherever you were coming from to get to

00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:36,790
the code and supply building what was

00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:38,950
going on in your head to allow you to

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,680
get here how did you actually how did

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,389
you actually navigate to this place

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,739
there's kind of two prevailing cognitive

00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:48,189
theories for how that happens you know

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:50,230
this this theory of cognitive maps so

00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,030
you have a map in your head or landmarks

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,139
so you're able to kind of see the world

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,859
is that they're kind of pictures or

00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,450
snapshots

00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:56,829
okay let's kind of see what that see

00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,090
what that means here so imagine you're

00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:59,200
out in the woods taking a hike and

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,939
you're trying to figure out how to get

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,579
to some cabin you know deep in the woods

00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:07,799
okay from the kind of cognitive Maps

00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:09,430
view of the world from that theory the

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,870
what scientists have kind of

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,459
hypothesized is you've got a map in your

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,930
head and you're able to kind of see that

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,989
as if you're looking from a bird's eye

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,280
view right out the world and you know

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,569
you're able to kind of orient yourself

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,939
and kind of see where you're going right

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,219
so this hiker might be saying oh well

00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:26,230
you know based on the angle the Sun and

00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:27,849
where I am in the woods I'm about three

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,919
hundred meters east of the cabin so I

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,439
need to you know turn right or something

00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,329
like that okay so this kind of bird's

00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,829
eye view top-down top-down view of the

00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:37,659
world kind of like what you would see on

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,659
like Google Maps or something like that

00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:43,209
right an alternative theory that has

00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:45,370
been proposed is this idea of cognitive

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,900
landmarks or this idea that you're

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,609
taking snapshots of the world as you

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,979
move through it okay and that's actually

00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:52,659
what we're using to to decide how to get

00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:53,919
from point A to point B so you know the

00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:55,720
same hiker might say oh well you take a

00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,489
left at the sign and then you walk until

00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,349
you find a rock with a T painted on it

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,879
and then you hike up the mountain and

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:02,560
then the cabin is you know next to the

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,810
waterfall right and then that's how you

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,849
would describe how to get to this this

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,449
location not not using not using this

00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:13,870
map but this these snapshots of of the

00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:16,930
world the actual world itself okay

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,509
so humans can't tell us what's going on

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,570
their heads but rats they can't tell us

00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:25,240
either but we can perform experiments on

00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,340
rats and a lot easier than we can on

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,770
humans okay and so to kind of put this

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,930
this question of how do we how do we

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,969
figure out where we're going to put this

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,870
to the test us we've done some

00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:38,380
experiments on rats

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,870
so specifically they devised this

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,460
call the Morris water maze where they

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,650
fill a tank with water drop the rat in

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,740
and it's able to kind of swim around and

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:50,380
find find the goal okay let's see this

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,900
experiment specifically so there's our

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,330
friendly little rat and our Morris water

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,000
maze basically so we start by filling

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,530
the tank with opaque kind of milky white

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,730
water as you saw in that previous

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,080
picture it's supposed to be a very

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,400
specific temperature if you mean for the

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,040
rat all that kind of stuff

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,290
but fill the tank with a big water and

00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,820
then just below the surface where the

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,620
rat can't see it under the milky water

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,500
there's a platform that's the goal the

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,270
safety point okay for this particular

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,800
experiment we're thinking about

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,840
reference points around the outside of

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,730
the of the water maze okay and let's see

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,470
here so then we're gonna hide a portion

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,280
of the maze so the rat never really sees

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:35,260
that section and then we train the rat

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,510
okay so we drop the rat in the in the

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,760
tank and it will swim to the goal and

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,350
eventually over time it's able to get

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,310
there directly very quickly it knows

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,860
exactly how to get there

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,240
all right at this point the rat has kind

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,310
of learned the maze all right but

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,270
they've only seen part of it so now

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,530
what's going on in this little guy's

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,910
brain okay so back to these two theories

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,800
it has the rat built this kind of

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,650
bird's-eye view a cognitive map of this

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,200
of this maze and is that how it's

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,280
figuring out how to get around or

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,410
alternatively has it looked and said oh

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,970
well next to the triangle and I swim to

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,770
the square and and then there's the

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,650
platform right is it building snapshots

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,920
to kind of get through the world so to

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,680
put this to the test this hidden area of

00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,950
the maze we show it and then we drop the

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,970
rat off in this new mysterious location

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,540
okay so the rats never seen this before

00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:27,250
the theory here is that if the if the

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,420
rat has built this cognitive map it's

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,280
not going to care where it is in the

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,710
tank if it's seen it before or not it's

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,840
going to be able to orient identify you

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,160
know where in the in in this kind of

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,540
bird's-eye view of the world it is and

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,900
then know exactly how to get to its goal

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,180
aim or if it's doing snapshots it's

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,830
going to say oh well I've never seen a

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,390
triangle from this angle before I don't

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,120
know where I am and it's going to behave

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,860
as if it is a as if it's a completely

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,939
new maze right in

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,590
sure enough that's basically what

00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:57,560
happened the rats when dropped in the

00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:01,610
new the new section became completely

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:04,430
disoriented It was as if it was a new

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,300
maze entirely and as a conclusion of

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,560
this experiment and many others you know

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:18,919
building up with more support for this

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:20,629
idea of cognitive landmarks alright

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,280
we've done this people have done the

00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:25,009
same experiment with honeybees okay so

00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,719
they taken honeybees and place their

00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,889
hives in specific locations allow them

00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,810
to find food sources and then they

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,699
rotate the hives and the bees just get

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,469
all kinds of lost which is pretty

00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,060
interesting we have actually done this

00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:39,259
experiment on humans too so through

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:42,550
virtual you know virtual reality able to

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:44,960
put different landmarks and different

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,210
arrangements to show that people can get

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,360
lost just as easily as rats and bees so

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,469
that's pretty cool as well we're gonna

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,479
do an experiment right now and all of

00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:54,979
you just to make sure that this is

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:59,539
actually true what I'm saying so I'm

00:07:54,979 --> 00:08:01,729
going to show a picture of objects I'd

00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,610
like you to memorize those objects I'm

00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,930
then going to hover the objects remove

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,669
one of them and then you have to tell me

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,430
what has been removed all right

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:13,669
so fair enough you can just yell it out

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,969
when you when you have it let's give

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,969
this a try

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,950
all right it's gonna cover it remove one

00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:36,460
and I can already see Anna sauce like oh

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:37,870
I got this alright car no idea all right

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,700
car was removed so it was the car that

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,260
time so we're gonna do this again it's

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,610
not exactly a perfect experiment same

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:55,210
set of objects alright ready for it

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:56,980
alright let's remove one yes so we have

00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,990
one right answer very quickly one wrong

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,690
answer very quickly a bunch of hesitant

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:05,650
people jumping back and forth I played a

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,960
trick on everybody on that one so you're

00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:10,000
using the kind of spatial location the

00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,040
landmarks within that that grid to

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,750
identify which objects were there it was

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,340
significantly more difficult just by a

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,800
slight rotation it was just one rotation

00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:21,190
right and through threw people off a

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,630
little bit yeah alright so there you go

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,950
landmarks we navigate using landmarks

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,160
cognitive landmarks building snapshots

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:32,590
of the world so right fantastic so what

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,560
how does it relate to software so let's

00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,790
try and connect this back to some some

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,960
interesting ideas about architecture and

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,140
how we can design our architectures

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:45,940
better okay so back to this original

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:48,010
hypothesis so what I'm proposing is that

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,270
we're gonna reuse these same ideas to go

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,590
through these abstract landscapes such

00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,600
as architecture that we use through

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,850
physical landscapes so knowing that we

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,110
need some kind of cognitive landmarks we

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,050
can now apply this to software

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,150
architecture hopefully so the big key

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:05,020
here right why is this important the big

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,890
key is you know if you if you can't

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,660
navigate through the architecture

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,480
effectively you're more likely to cause

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,440
trouble okay

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,240
get lost within the system and cause

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,540
trouble and this is bad for a number of

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,950
reasons so yeah there you go

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,540
like that like they caused some trouble

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,890
there you could be doing things like

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,320
violating the architecture in different

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,570
ways you could be introducing complexity

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,370
that didn't need to be there possibly

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,960
blowing up quality attributes like

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,640
performance or maintainability or

00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,360
testability just because you don't know

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,800
where you are where you're going so we

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,760
want to prevent that from happening so

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,300
for

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:44,050
for us animation didn't work there for

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,100
us the the whole idea is we don't wanna

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,460
be like hacking through the jungle with

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,810
machetes right we want to want to be

00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,860
much more controlled and specific about

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,220
how we're going through things and

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,900
guiding people guiding our team with us

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,440
to kind of go through go through the

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,570
system okay let's see here

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
yeah and the big key with this I can't

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,910
see the landmarks that are in your head

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,830
so we have to figure out ways to get

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,150
those ideas out of your head and into

00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,620
into your teammates head so that

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:12,340
everybody can be successful moving

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,770
around alright so there's a number

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,210
different ways that we can do that a lot

00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,990
of times we do talk about maps and

00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,100
that's basically one of the predominant

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,650
metaphors that we teach with

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,120
architecture right we talk about these

00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,040
these kind of top-down views or these

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,620
high-level views you can call the 50,000

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,170
foot views all pretty frequently you

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,850
know we'll talk about how oh you can you

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:37,060
can have a zoomed out view you can zoom

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,760
in to see different different aspects of

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,950
the system we talked about being able to

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,110
apply different different views or

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,640
different layers onto the onto the

00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,560
architecture for different perspectives

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,380
right so this is a topographic view of

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,850
Pittsburgh there's another view of

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,290
Pittsburgh this one for a specific

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,880
stakeholders may be a tourist or

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,410
something right who wants to be touring

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,270
downtown architecture diagrams

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,640
themselves we even put legends on them

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,350
just like maps right so this is

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,340
something that is very much ingrained in

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:12,790
the way we do things and I think that's

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,930
that's good but there's something that

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,610
the best software designers are doing

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,440
when they see these maps they're somehow

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,470
extracting something different or

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,150
they're taking internalizing ideas that

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:26,560
are not present in those maps okay so

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,270
what we're gonna explore here now are

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,390
some alternatives to this idea of our

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,620
key architectural cartography okay so we

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,230
wanted we want to try and do some

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,180
different things for things we're going

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,190
to talk about over the next couple of

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,270
minutes here so how we're gonna you know

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,280
maybe some different strategies for

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,660
creating snapshots we're going to talk

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,710
about different ways of leaving traces

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,620
and I would clean what that means in a

00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,970
minute

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,170
and we'll briefly talk about telling

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,620
stories and kind of the importance of

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,990
storytelling and then finally we'll

00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,220
explore some ideas of how we might live

00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,170
in the architecture kind of bring it

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,420
into the physical world which is

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,709
probably the least explored in this talk

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:07,870
but it's something cool to think about

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:09,279
so yeah before we get into that though I

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,600
do want to share some context so these

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,000
stories are coming specifically from my

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,910
team at IBM we're a team of about nine

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,459
engineers or so give or take you ever

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:22,149
take a little bit bearing backgrounds

00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:24,520
varying levels of experience we were

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,740
doing like scrum with some expertise

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,370
tile practices that kind of stuff

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,600
the reason I bring that up is as you're

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,089
here listening to these things that's

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,250
the context that we were in so keep that

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:37,810
in mind to kind of translate it into

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,850
your own context and I'm happy to kind

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,370
of talk about specific ideas for that

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,870
afterwards for however you you know for

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,660
whatever format your team is in right

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,520
however you guys are organized for us we

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,080
were doing the kind of traditional well

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,360
traditional I don't know there is a

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,320
traditional one but micro-services with

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,779
a large group of people across watson

00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,830
probably one of the more challenging

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,950
environments I've seen anyway from like

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:06,970
a security and security and governance

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:10,810
perspective it's both good and bad I

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,459
guess so keep that in mind as well yeah

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,370
and so for us we have like one we were

00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:17,200
one team among probably five or six

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,880
across a pretty pretty broad area

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,209
okay so just some context as we're

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,910
exploring to do these ideas okay so

00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:26,170
snapshot so recall back so when we're

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,490
talking about these cognitive landmarks

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,290
these snapshots we're talking about kind

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,600
of a first-person view of the world you

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:34,240
know turn right at the the sign turn

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,810
left at the tree and you'll arrive at

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,640
your destination

00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,290
okay one AMPA size that said you have

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,450
maps maps are not necessarily bad

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,790
they're just not sufficient in all cases

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,810
okay

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,370
so let's explore some let's see some

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,079
ways that we can use maps and kind of

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:54,220
inject some more of this thinking for us

00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:58,089
here okay so what we want is views of

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,170
our the architectural views that we're

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,399
producing we

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,110
to be able to see those landmarks that

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,269
are within them okay so they should be

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,450
showing us some kind of reference points

00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,290
for people to use this is actually we

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,339
were ragging on this a little bit

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,920
earlier this is actually a pretty good

00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:13,329
map from that idea it's like you know

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,089
it's highlighting some of these

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,769
different key landmarks downtown so you

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:21,220
could say to somebody you know oh go to

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:22,360
the stadium and then turn turn left and

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,959
then walk by the river and you'll find

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,260
the casino or something right so I don't

00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:31,930
know pretty pretty interesting example

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,100
this diagram as drawn is not giving us

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,779
any that kind of stuff but we can modify

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,339
it in a couple of interesting ways to

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,430
kind of start to make these ideas more

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:40,930
concrete so kind of hidden in this thing

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,120
we've got a simple kind of tiered

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,180
pattern right off the bat and this

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,310
diagram was drawn this way to be able to

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,690
pull out that that tiered that's your

00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,089
pattern and in fact the way that I'm

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,350
referencing that now when when we talk

00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,329
about this amongst our team you will see

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,269
people moving their hands and gesturing

00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,920
you know in different ways as if you

00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:03,370
know there's a top to down top to bottom

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,779
structure okay so that's kind of the

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,070
first key thing patterns are landmarks

00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,690
and we want to be able to highlight them

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,670
within the the different views that

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,050
we're producing okay so there's lots of

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,230
different patterns whatever it is layers

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,720
tiers pub/sub peer-to-peer pick your

00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,250
poison okay pick a pattern or invent

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,870
your own it really doesn't matter the

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,070
main thing is whatever your patterns are

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,769
that you're using make sure that they're

00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:27,880
obvious in some way in the diagrams that

00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:29,949
you're producing okay all right there's

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,600
another kind of hidden hidden landmark

00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:33,519
here which i think is kind of

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,570
interesting and that is that we have

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,920
different teams working on different

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,910
portions of the system where we did at

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,260
one time so by kind of arranging we

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,269
could have arranged these things within

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,430
the horizontal tiers in many different

00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:47,140
ways with this particular arrangement

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,000
though it's very easy to kind of see a

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,440
reference point of where I am in the

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,440
world and who might be working on which

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,819
parts of the system I don't have the

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,930
other diagrams that kind of go with this

00:16:54,819 --> 00:17:02,380
this series of the series of work here

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,850
but we would try and keep things in the

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,199
same kind of positioning even within the

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,179
diagrams themselves as you're moving

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,939
through different parts of the system

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,530
which is kind of interesting okay so if

00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:13,450
you can help people

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,310
see where their work applies they're

00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,470
going to be able to internalize what

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,550
they're doing a lot better okay and

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,920
that's a simple thing that we can do in

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:23,800
these diagrams all right another thing

00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,320
that we can do is applying different

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:32,770
views to kind of bring more context to

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:34,030
different things so this is not super

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,100
visible from here but that's okay

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:40,090
dark is bad all right we'll just say

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,710
that so if you're able to show things

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,240
like you know these are the good

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,520
components - the bad components how good

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,810
or how bad whatever that may mean in

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,940
this case we're looking at like

00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,170
technical debt this is giving you a

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,020
reference point that you can then use

00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,550
for having conversations say about the

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,680
evolution of the system how to get from

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,990
point A to point B right so in this case

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,640
we removed one of the worst components

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:07,060
to make way for a simpler future right

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,890
okay so yeah we want our views to have

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,720
these relatable reference points so

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,060
however you get them in there color is

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,260
one way notations are another lots of

00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:20,230
different options with that this is just

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:23,770
one example okay let's see here yeah

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,660
okay so this this chunk is I think a

00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:30,850
little more interesting so we'll get

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:32,800
into this so the next thing the next

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:36,480
thing that I think that my team and IBM

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,560
did really well is we leave traces okay

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,030
leave traces for others to follow this

00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,370
idea comes from this fantastic book

00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:44,140
called on trails I strongly encourage

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,600
encourage you to pick it up especially

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,420
if you're an outdoor enthusiast it's

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,010
it's very good but Robert Moore

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,980
basically defines this idea of a trace

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,420
as a visible mark left by the passage of

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,700
a person or animal so as you're moving

00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,440
through the world we're leaving we're

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,460
leaving traces as we go footprints or

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,230
you know scratches or bits or something

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,730
over time right if we leave enough

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,800
traces then we start to kind of carve

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,510
out trails for others to follow which is

00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,470
why these traces are interesting okay

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,720
this picture this is interesting because

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,520
there's actually a number of traces that

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,470
we can see just in this one picture both

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,990
man-made and you know human-made and

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,240
also well I guess all human-made some

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,530
intentional and some accidental

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,540
yes would be the the best way to put it

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,700
so first most obvious when somebody's

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,800
like a sign here you know turn here

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,640
write a very important kind of marker

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:39,220
that was left there's a off to the side

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,690
a blaze right so another another mark

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,370
that was left for people to kind of see

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,980
and follow a little more subtle but also

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,510
important and then probably the most

00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,950
subtle in this case is you can actually

00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,510
see just a little bit where people

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,760
through their footsteps we're starting

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:53,380
to carve out a trail on the ground okay

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,600
so these are the types of traces that we

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,800
want to try and figure out how to leave

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,330
within our software systems right as

00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,720
architects so that people can actually

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:05,170
find the architecture our Tech's leave

00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,270
tonnes of traces or at least I hope most

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,740
architects are the first first probably

00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,360
most important one is in the code itself

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,000
right this is our number one most

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,550
important opportunity for leaving some

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,380
kind of trail some kind of trace for the

00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:20,380
architecture right is within the code

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,790
itself there's lots and lots of

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,710
different ways lots of strategies to do

00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:27,040
this and I'm not going to go into any of

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,320
them tonight but these sure would be

00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,230
great topics for future code and supply

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,880
meetups architect early evident coding

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,430
style is probably one of the more

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,570
important ideas it has to do with making

00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,280
these structures that we draw on

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,590
whiteboards actually apparent in the

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,480
code so if you call a thing a business

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,540
layer well maybe you should have a

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:50,080
package called business layer right it

00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:52,000
sounds easy people don't do it right and

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,190
probably the biggest offender is the you

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,020
know you till the junk drawer of all of

00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,450
all things right the slow deterioration

00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,180
of the architecture that way you can

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,650
leave comments to describe rationale you

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,960
can leave comments within your version

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,480
control history to like describe the

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,780
evolution of the system over time I'm a

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,400
huge fan of using testing and and I kind

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,380
of call it domain centric design I don't

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,840
really want to pigeonhole this into like

00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,610
DDD domain driven design but taking kind

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,510
of a problem first perspective or a

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,710
domain kind of first perspective on your

00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,840
architecture itself is a fantastic way

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,300
to kind of create these connections and

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,130
leave these traces okay if you are

00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,200
interested in these topics these two

00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,390
books are great resources that you

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,220
should check out just enough software

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,750
architecture by George Fairbanks he kind

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,280
of

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,010
coin didn't research a lot of these

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,510
ideas and then Simon brown with the

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,040
software architecture for developers has

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:49,410
done a great job expanding on it and

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,830
really really making it a core practice

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,480
okay

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,830
practice I want to talk about tonight

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,710
that we've been using for quite a while

00:21:53,830 --> 00:22:01,450
on my team at IBM was architecture

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,310
decision records and I assume those are

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,630
still flying around occasionally okay so

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:09,640
there have been new ones since I left

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:12,610
that's a great sign oh that's wonderful

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,870
on an 80mm all right so architecture

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,890
decision record so basically it's a

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:20,290
short text file in a short text file

00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:22,120
that describes the set of forces and a

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,700
single decision in response to those

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,130
forces so we're looking at recording a

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:29,950
single idea context around that idea and

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,160
rationale for for kind of why it came to

00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,920
be you know why do we care

00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:38,350
alright this idea has been around I

00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,860
should point this out for 25 years or

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,420
more it becomes cool every five to seven

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,260
years so we're on maybe the fourth wave

00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,280
of coolness for recording decisions it

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,260
seems to be the one that's finally

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,860
sticking so that's that's a good sign I

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,450
think all right let's see an example to

00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,220
make this a little more concrete so

00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,950
here's an ER pretty simple one it says

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,770
use the pipe and filter library right so

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,280
we basically said we're gonna use a

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:07,630
we're gonna use a library to enforce a

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,730
architectural pattern pipe and filter

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:13,240
right so we're strongly enforcing it

00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:15,490
right it's short right there's not much

00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,800
to this it's less than a page if we were

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,350
to actually print it out a couple of

00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,120
pieces of this so the context the kind

00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,550
of forces at play are described at the

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,280
top the decision itself just a one

00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:29,590
sentence we will do something and then

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,750
the consequences as a result of this

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,790
decision here are the positive and

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,560
negative effects that might happen okay

00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,260
and I think we zoom in on some of these

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,330
so if there's anything interesting we

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:44,050
absolutely need to go through yeah so

00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,700
we're talking about things like how the

00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,490
teams behave to different ideas in the

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,830
past right so maybe the skills and the

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,490
team and things like that we're talking

00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,690
about

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:59,740
available libraries we're talking about

00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:01,510
you know the use of the pattern in the

00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,590
past and the kind of the technical

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:06,970
fitness of the pattern and things like

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:09,159
that a lot of the bla the decision super

00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,870
simple we will use the pipe and filter

00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,049
library to organize that Asian logic so

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,390
not not too interesting or surprising

00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:17,350
status is one of those things I think

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,210
well we've been experimenting with a

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,309
little bitter we have been maybe it's

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,750
continued still but basically a decision

00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:25,779
can be accepted or it can be deprecated

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,620
or it can be proposed right if it's an

00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:28,390
idea that you just want to capture

00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,669
things like that

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,990
I think the consequences are much more

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,909
interesting probably the most important

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:38,919
part of the whole thing so here we're

00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:40,059
getting into things about the really the

00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:43,120
quality attributes that we're trying to

00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:45,460
promote so how did this influence the

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,270
testability of the system it looks like

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,919
we're talking about things like

00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:53,649
observability with logging and metrics

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,909
here right yeah reliability so there's

00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:56,230
some reliability concerns it looks like

00:24:54,909 --> 00:25:00,399
in this bottom one about uncaught

00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:02,380
uncaught conditions or errors so I don't

00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:04,539
know some interesting stuff I think this

00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,820
is available on the web and other places

00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:09,090
as well lots of info into a TRS right

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,070
now out there that's cool

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,809
over time as we're checking these things

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,299
into the version control system we start

00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:17,470
to get a record of all the different

00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:20,200
design decisions that were made which

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,600
was pretty darn cool for you know

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,860
leaving leaving trails right creating

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,750
little traces as you go and then leaving

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,580
trails for other software developers to

00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,890
follow behind you and kind of understand

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:35,649
what's happening so kind of a neat neat

00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:38,820
side effect so yeah I don't know if I'm

00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:41,289
gonna go into all the yeah well yes so a

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,520
side benefit of what we found with this

00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,409
particular technique also great for

00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,510
training which is kind of cool so you

00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,399
can see each one of these colors

00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,809
represents the a TRS contributed the

00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:51,940
decisions being made effectively by

00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:54,279
different developers on the team and

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,799
really what this is showing us is in the

00:25:54,279 --> 00:26:00,850
beginning it was basically just me and

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,020
then slowly over time I was making fewer

00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,340
and fewer decisions and more and more

00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,200
teammates were getting involved so this

00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,169
is a fantastic way to get

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:13,149
more people involved in the design

00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:14,639
process but then also increased kind of

00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:16,630
confidence training and lots of other

00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:19,590
lots of other really great things and

00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,590
eventually it came to the point where

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:27,639
the vast majority of things were coming

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,139
from other people so yeah contributed

00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:31,269
just this little little tiny sliver

00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:33,850
maybe two and then everyone else was

00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:35,470
contributing significantly significantly

00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,090
more so that's that's pretty cool and we

00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,809
can see that over time just by mining my

00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:42,669
name to get logs which is kind of neat

00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,899
all right so yeah the whole theory here

00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:45,370
if we leave it up traces in the system

00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:48,789
through architecture li evident coding

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:51,429
styles through design records many many

00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:53,500
other techniques then well well we'll

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:56,110
eventually start to blaze some trails

00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,789
that are gonna show people how to

00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,710
promote maintainability or how to

00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:00,820
promote modify ability how to move

00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:16,929
through the system which is pretty darn

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:24,070
cool all right so telling stories right

00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:25,960
so the big question so when you are

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,730
we're doing all these great things where

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,260
we're leaving traces we're making views

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,519
that show things that are happening how

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,779
in the heck do people find out about

00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:33,610
these things or know that they should be

00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:35,710
looking for them the way we do things or

00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,289
the way we did things when uh when I was

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:40,419
there and I'm sure it still is happening

00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:43,870
was telling stories lots of lots of

00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:46,720
stories so we use sticky notes we redraw

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,039
those views continuously anytime we need

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,269
to talk about something you know we're

00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,269
at we're at a whiteboard kind of drawing

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,000
kind of building building out these well

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,100
building out these stories about how the

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,260
system came to be why it is the way that

00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,480
it is and describing to each other what

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,620
it looks like well some of the

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,269
techniques that we use for kind of

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:10,960
helping to encourage this kind of

00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:13,570
storytelling so we are focusing on the

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,070
user very very strongly okay so that's

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,049
probably the the most important thing is

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,730
always having that kind of problem first

00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:21,010
or kind of user centric kind of

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,500
kind of view of the world we do a lot of

00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,910
sketching so architecture is abstract by

00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,800
nature right it doesn't release

00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:29,170
structures don't really exist until you

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,340
make them manifest in some way drawing

00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,800
is a really great way to make them

00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:37,180
concrete so you know we really need to

00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,400
be sketching a lot observing exerting my

00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,080
IBM team at work we would take turns

00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,000
which I thought was very interesting so

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,490
it wouldn't just be me telling the story

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,650
all the time it would be you know hey

00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,940
hey Don why don't you tell so-and-so how

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,610
it happens and then maybe I would just

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,650
listen right or we would go through a

00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,090
round of explaining how a certain

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,130
decision would be made and what we would

00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,780
do about it and then we would say okay

00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,790
you know Joe why don't you play it back

00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,930
tell us what we just decided right so

00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,630
this kind of turn-taking kind of

00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:06,790
activity trying to use the traces that

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:09,220
we made to kind of encourage people to

00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,270
follow those where we could and one

00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,100
thing that I really liked about what we

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:15,400
did is just asking questions and that is

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:17,530
really a bit of a bit of an art tour or

00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,240
you really need to practice learning how

00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:22,420
to ask questions and creating an

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,510
environment where it's safe and okay to

00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,820
ask dumb questions right because we need

00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,960
those dumb questions to be asked to make

00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,330
sure that we actually know what we're

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,710
talking about so constantly kind of

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:39,940
questioning and challenging what's going

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:43,270
on all right so the storytelling and all

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:46,690
this is great for creating this kind of

00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:48,100
oral history and there's there's a

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,920
really fantastic chapter in that on

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,170
trails book that talks about a different

00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,680
Native American tribes keeping oral

00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:58,960
histories alive for generations right to

00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:03,940
the point where some of the Native

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,760
Americans displaced to reservations were

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,920
able to generations later come back to

00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,920
where they they were originally from and

00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,090
still we're able to walk through walk

00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,340
through like the mountains of Appalachia

00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:19,390
and know where to go which is just

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,680
amazing these oral histories collapse if

00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,850
we don't work to keep them alive so it's

00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,980
something that we have to constantly

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,320
continue to work on and constantly kind

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,970
of keep going and this is something that

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,590
I'm interested I'm going to give it away

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,320
I want to come back and visit you guys

00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,590
my team in say six to eight months and

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,010
see

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:39,450
it actually works if how well those oral

00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,450
histories are still still alive

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,570
right so you have to kind of build this

00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,980
culture and continue kind of encouraging

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,590
the storytelling to keep those things

00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:50,320
going all right

00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,220
so last little bit here so living in

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,830
your architecture are there different

00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,690
ways that we can do this so we've been

00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,279
talking about about landmarks and things

00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,580
and are there ways we can bring these

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,980
landmarks into the physical space and

00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:07,360
this this was my desk at the IBM office

00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:08,740
and there actually is some evidence that

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,480
this is possible to kind of bring these

00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:16,149
ideas in into the space so from where

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:18,850
from where I sat at in the office the

00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:20,649
architecture basically became became

00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:24,760
kind of real so if I would look to the

00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:27,190
right I would see you know an estas for

00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,830
example working on different pieces of

00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,140
the query components different search

00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:33,610
algorithms I would see Jenny working on

00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,010
something having to do with some of our

00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:38,500
rest facades right another piece of the

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,750
architecture way back in the corner I

00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,070
would see Chuck freaking out over

00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,380
something having to do with the platform

00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,360
crashing knowing that all of our all of

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:52,120
our DevOps pipelines have probably just

00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:54,669
exploded right so based on who I saw

00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:59,710
talking to whom and who is moving around

00:31:54,669 --> 00:32:01,360
where I could see the dependencies

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,190
within our system I could see new

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,690
connections being made I could see

00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,679
different ways of the code was actually

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,620
coming together which I thought was

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,929
pretty neat looking over to the left it

00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:14,440
was the same thing so you know I'd be

00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,399
able to see Joe or Eitan freaking out

00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,480
about something having to do with the

00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:22,360
training aspects of our system either

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,919
crashing or going down or maybe bringing

00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,840
in some new functionality right

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,399
depending on who is talking to them and

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,559
then way way back in the corner you're

00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:31,720
gonna see through the window would be

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:34,390
the are offering team the product

00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,830
managers and probably most importantly

00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,690
with them is if they're not at their

00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,960
desks you got to be worried because

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:42,690
they're probably off talking to some

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,530
executives and coming up with amazing

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,220
amazing new features that we don't have

00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,800
time to build

00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:50,890
so it it was good to kind of keep an eye

00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,000
on them even though it didn't

00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,500
necessarily have to do with the

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,420
architecture the business drivers I

00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:59,680
guess but yeah all right so I don't know

00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,660
this that's kind of the only way that

00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,400
I've one of the the only observations

00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,430
I've seen about bringing these systems

00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,960
these designs that we make into the real

00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,730
world which I thought was interesting

00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,890
but I think there's a lot more that

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,790
could be done right so maybe we can

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,880
start playing with physical

00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:17,140
manipulatives right so these are the

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,080
what the organic chemistry kits

00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:25,660
that people play with to help teach

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:28,180
chemistry in high school in college the

00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,680
Lego serious play workshops are pretty

00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,540
interesting for exploring business

00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,460
concepts I wonder if we could be doing

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,680
something with this to make our

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:40,090
architectures manifest in reality in the

00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:43,950
physical space a little bit more let's

00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:46,450
see here 3d printing has been around and

00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:48,070
affordable for quite a while I have no

00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,020
idea if it would be possible to print a

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,610
view of the architecture but it would be

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,640
certainly interesting to explore that

00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:56,110
idea man it wouldn't it be cool if we

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,380
could like actually go into the computer

00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,690
in some way right like in Tron around oh

00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:05,290
yes my architecture looks beautiful

00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:06,810
today no architecture violation right

00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:10,090
now we'll just get zapped zap the heck

00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:11,650
anyway so I think that would be

00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,020
wonderful but it's also not that far off

00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:17,560
right so things like that we saw that we

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:19,800
see in Ironman being able to have 3d 3d

00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,420
representations are not super crazy

00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,020
given a lot of the advances and stuff

00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:27,790
like hololens or the magic leaf mixed

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,760
reality headsets and things so there's

00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:33,250
some cool stuff that could be happening

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,600
maybe for software the way we design

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,910
systems that way we communicate with

00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,260
each other I don't know too many people

00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,010
who are experimenting with these things

00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,380
right now

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:43,090
so I leave these here kind of as a I

00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,410
don't know a seed maybe to get people

00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:48,130
thinking about about that kind of stuff

00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:52,120
a little bit all right so let's wrap it

00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:54,670
up so we explore two questions how do

00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,950
people navigate through the world and

00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:58,290
then how can we use this knowledge to

00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:02,460
design our

00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:05,820
our architectures better mechanic came

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,170
from this hypothesis that well humans

00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,060
are gonna go through abstract abstract

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:13,170
landscapes in a similar way as they do

00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:15,780
physical landscapes and we learned about

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,370
you know some of the cognitive theory

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,480
behind that and that we are actually

00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,820
moving through the world using cognitive

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:26,010
landmarks okay not not kind of these

00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,660
maps so the fact that we present the

00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,220
world our architectures oftentimes and

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:34,500
maps but if people seem to need

00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:35,850
landmarks could explain why why some

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,260
teams are able to get away with creating

00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,520
so little documentation they're just

00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:43,680
doing a really good job of building

00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:45,180
those landmarks or building those

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,160
landmarks or at least translating those

00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,020
maps in some way so we need to do more

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,880
of that kind of stuff and and maybe less

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:56,460
of the less of the other things yeah so

00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,600
the best this is me speculating this

00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,040
point the best architects could be

00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,300
translating the software systems into

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,160
these landmarks I don't I don't know of

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,840
a good way to test that but it does seem

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,570
very very plausible that's what's

00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,980
happening the one catch with all this so

00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,110
design is kind of limited by our

00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,990
imaginations a little bit right so we

00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,150
can do practically anything which means

00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,170
the landscapes are basically infinite so

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,090
we do need to think about how to

00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,340
constrain them in different ways and

00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,460
that's where ideas like using patterns

00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:28,290
or trying to to make them concrete

00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:30,330
through drawing comes in right so and

00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,400
then right coming up a different eye

00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,770
it's pouring different ways such as ADRs

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:40,020
for leaving traces as well many many

00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:42,660
different ways to do that so what I hope

00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,370
is that we'll take a few things away

00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,740
from this for creating some landmarks in

00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,580
your code or in your system or at least

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,930
finding the things that are already

00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,960
there and highlighting them in some way

00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,160
I think it's a huge opportunity for

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,770
improving the designs and improving

00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,700
communication and with that I hope you

00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:00,060
did get a few things to put your

00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:02,330
silver/silver toolbox and thank you very

00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,330
much

00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:08,760
[Applause]

00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:20,800
go for it

00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:22,510
sure versus nine marks or verses maps it

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,950
is also true from kind of science that

00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:32,200
we do have parts of our brain at this

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:34,330
location and one way we I would say I

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,369
would argue that we that this I think is

00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:39,130
really interesting and very accurate but

00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:41,680
we use landmarks to construct maps so

00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:44,380
this is one seems like this is talking

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,230
about one phase of that landscape making

00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,820
and from there what you you think

00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,349
there's anything interesting to comment

00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,140
on there like do we care about what the

00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:55,000
funnel map ends up being how accurate

00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:58,210
doesn't things like that yeah

00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,640
so there's you're right there's an like

00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,800
multiple layers deeper of cognitive

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,020
science that I do not know squat about

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:11,740
so I'll just throw that out there I'm a

00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:13,960
software engineer the I do recall from

00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:16,210
some of the research I was doing that it

00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,790
does lead to some kind of map building

00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,020
but the idea I think is the starting

00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,940
point is very very different right

00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:25,210
rather than starting from the from the

00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:27,160
map I don't know that I have any other

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:32,890
intelligent comments I could say someone

00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:35,020
intelligent ones I guess yeah there's a

00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:43,020
lot more to explore I think with this

00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:43,020
topic yes always

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,290
I know figure out where to put it stick

00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,589
it somewhere like this yeah let me get

00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,589
available

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:08,860
we can observe that rats and other

00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:13,300
creatures of landmarks well rats I don't

00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:14,410
know tell anybody but yeah well and they

00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,810
can't talk either

00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:18,070
but right I think that's an interesting

00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,590
question that we should be asking

00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:22,240
ourselves right I think that's what we

00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,220
need to be asking ourselves so what I am

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,900
challenging is the idea that I can just

00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,880
draw a map and just drop it on you and

00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:32,890
then expect you to necessarily be able

00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,420
to figure everything out it and it's

00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:38,100
going to be it's going to be challenging

00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:42,550
and you're going to get things wrong

00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:44,920
which maybe is okay or maybe maybe we

00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,810
can make it easier for you to kind of

00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,280
develop that first-hand experience I

00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,600
guess as you're using that map

00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,750
navigating for the first time building

00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,400
your own snapshots right and you are

00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,070
100% correct I don't want to make it

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,170
sound like oh never draw diagrams baby

00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,540
out with the bathwater absolutely not we

00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,120
need both of these ideas we need the

00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,500
maps but we also need to acknowledge

00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,430
that there are other things that can

00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:11,170
help us communicate more effectively and

00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:14,260
share these ideas more effectively of

00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:21,030
which I think there's probably many many

00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:21,030
others with your experience cool

00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:14,090
directions right right and yeah I think

00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,530
that idea of kind of the what are your

00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,400
goals where are you trying to go what

00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:20,720
are you trying to make sure happens

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,110
right and then context context is always

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:27,800
important right so even as you're giving

00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:28,810
that Trina still yeah sure so the some

00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,130
of the hiking pictures that I showed

00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:34,280
were from a trip that we took in Norway

00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,320
a number of years ago where we had maps

00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,420
that were not useful in that particular

00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,820
case but the written instructions in

00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,900
like broken English because we had run

00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,780
it through translators and stuff from

00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,310
their region turned out to be fantastic

00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,260
and it said things like you know turn at

00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:52,700
the sign and walk till you find a giant

00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:54,170
rock and things like that we got a very

00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,250
kind of mission oriented kind of goal in

00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:59,420
that case right about getting to a

00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:01,760
specific location and I think for when

00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,560
we're talking about like pattern seekers

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,350
or explorers and things like that

00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,930
probably a different set of skills maybe

00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,830
come to play but then the question is

00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,690
like how do you share that information

00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:19,790
when you get back I don't know kind of

00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:21,530
interesting possibly related thought

00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,140
like one of the things at least in my

00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,820
experience that makes maps about 500

00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,440
times more useful as Italy you are here

00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,550
icon like if you've ever seen a shopping

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,960
mall map and you were like I don't know

00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,190
what this is saying and then they're

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,670
like oh you're standing next to the

00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:36,950
elevator and you're like now I get it

00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:39,590
and that seems to kind of help you like

00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:41,570
you know track the map to the landmarks

00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,590
right so you see the elevator next to

00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:45,050
you in the elevator on the map and

00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:48,530
you're like right there it is so they're

00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:52,520
kind of a you are here analogy you feel

00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:54,470
in your model yeah I tried to show some

00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,840
examples of that I think a lot of that's

00:42:54,470 --> 00:43:01,250
going to depend on the size of the

00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:04,390
system and the task for the the goal at

00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:07,670
hand or what you're trying to promote

00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:10,540
yeah I know there's different ways you

00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:10,540
could try and capture it

00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:16,119
I've actually used that though awesome

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,650
and what I've done is I've used that

00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:21,099
actually when I've had more of a longer

00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:24,160
term vision on how an architecture is to

00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:26,950
evolve over time and I've literally put

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,499
you know okay this stuff is shape is

00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:32,319
shaded being that it doesn't exist yet

00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:35,410
or you know stuff like that to show

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:38,160
different ways that the architectures to

00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,160
evolve over time

00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:45,849
yeah there's lots of yeah there

00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:47,619
notations color the animations like

00:43:45,849 --> 00:44:32,799
making pictures

00:43:47,619 --> 00:44:34,119
I think ways to do it which is the high

00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:36,609
turnover rate is definitely a challenge

00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,170
and that's something with lending home

00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:40,239
where I am now that I think is kind of

00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:42,969
interesting there they've been around

00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,619
for about four years now and a couple of

00:44:42,969 --> 00:44:46,989
years ago they saw some significant

00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:50,039
turnover with I don't know things in San

00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:51,729
Francisco being the way San Francisco is

00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:53,529
to the point where there's only a

00:44:51,729 --> 00:44:56,289
handful of people left to kind of know

00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:58,269
the core right which is cool but also

00:44:56,289 --> 00:44:59,979
terrifying right I'm so rebuilding the

00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:01,349
oral history as a big deal that's going

00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:05,769
on right now

00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:09,099
so the knowing who those people are I

00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:10,930
think is very important the word like

00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:12,789
linchpins right the kind of central

00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:17,229
points who kind of know what is going on

00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:18,579
is very very important these guys are

00:45:17,229 --> 00:45:19,749
sick of me saying it but I think pair

00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:22,690
programming is probably the number one

00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:24,309
superpower of all software development

00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,569
so getting people working together and

00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:26,829
kind of talking to one another as

00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:29,019
they're making decisions and doing

00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:30,460
things and then I've been a huge fan of

00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:32,289
the architecture decision records we

00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,019
we've been using them for about two

00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:38,230
years maybe a little bit longer now and

00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:40,390
they've been I think pretty pretty

00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:43,799
interesting and pretty successful in at

00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:46,119
least keeping a thread of something that

00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:47,500
would give you know even if you don't

00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:53,519
have much context up an entry point

00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:53,519
maybe so lightweight documentation

00:45:54,630 --> 00:46:00,970
exactly right exactly so I kind of the

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,680
working theory that I have with this

00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:04,660
stuff is there's probably four or five

00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,160
maybe six different things that are

00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,259
super lightweight and can be very very

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,240
natural what you're doing and if you're

00:46:08,259 --> 00:46:11,289
doing all those things together then it

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,240
all just kind of works if you're only

00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:14,920
doing like if you're only doing a TRS

00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,630
it's probably not going to work if

00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,559
you're only doing pair programming or

00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:19,210
something it's probably not going to

00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:21,069
work but if you're doing all these

00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,359
different ideas together it seems to

00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:24,069
kind of create these bonus multipliers

00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:25,900
that make architecture a lot easier to

00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:30,960
deal with without having to write the

00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,960
big documents and things like that yes

00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:36,099
basically a five year I've been in the

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,559
processor in a five-year plan for

00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:40,690
architecture for a hundred developers of

00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,750
an enterprise system which is definitely

00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:46,509
a level of both oh yeah I have maybe ten

00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:48,339
actual documents you don't have to be

00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:50,680
that document heavy you just have to

00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:53,079
have the right ones and get key holders

00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:55,359
understanding and distributing the

00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:56,920
information I bet you talk to a lot of

00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,410
people though you probably talk to a lot

00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,690
of people right I thought Google oh yeah

00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:04,390
so he's one of those one of those people

00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:06,279
that holds it together right constantly

00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,049
telling stories and showing and sharing

00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:16,660
and describing and explaining and

00:47:08,049 --> 00:47:18,730
keeping it all alive so yeah I don't

00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,109
want to be more advantageous for older

00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,190
and legacy software like even the

00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:22,630
difference of the master team like

00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:24,579
Pittsburgh in San Francisco you showed

00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:26,470
like San Francisco's a newer city and

00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:27,940
based on more of a grid the Pittsburgh

00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,540
is kind of a hodgepodge of different

00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:34,320
municipalities from

00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:36,960
years passed you do you think that you

00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,790
might be able to go towards one theory

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,900
for like something from the 60s as

00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:44,520
compared to something like your design

00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:45,750
from scratch today yeah I don't know I

00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,150
don't have much first-hand experience

00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,410
with massively legacy systems I think

00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,630
the things that I've been working with

00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:55,230
there's always been somebody around who

00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,460
can kind of describe what's going on so

00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,750
there's some things that I'd be

00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,760
interested to explore around

00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,590
architectural reconstruction so

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,590
especially with respects like

00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:08,280
storytelling so being able to go in and

00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:09,420
almost like a I'm an archaeologist and

00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,490
anthropologist almost like an

00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,720
anthropologist of observing the way

00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:14,520
people are working and getting people to

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,400
tell you the stories and kind of slowly

00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,620
recreating what's going on I I think

00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,050
things like that might work but I don't

00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:24,510
really know and then to the point in the

00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:25,860
back like it's not about big documents

00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,660
right and it's not even about

00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,070
lightweight things it's about the right

00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:33,630
combination of things for your group

00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:35,430
right so I think with legacy systems you

00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:37,200
have that trick that some of the things

00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,480
like architecture early evident coding

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,210
styles or bringing and testing to help

00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,650
kind of frame the architecture in those

00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,330
aren't really gonna be options right so

00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:48,480
that kind of does constrain constraining

00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:51,540
the world a bit which would leave things

00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,920
like documentation right to kind of warn

00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,250
people where things are described what's

00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,250
happening

00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:00,770
Oh awesome let that listen to the expert

00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:21,270
just logging inserting as many logs into

00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:23,030
your code as you can in tests and

00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:26,460
they're running through stuff and

00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:28,170
literally especially they make it make

00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,390
sure it's single threaded you know make

00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:33,690
sure it's you know so you're not getting

00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:36,510
you know too much overhead but injecting

00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:38,760
you know a lot of messages and or you

00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:43,660
know using a debugger and just seeing

00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:45,890
what happens and then mapping that out

00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:48,020
yeah our architecture reconstruction is

00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:49,760
an interesting topic that's definitely

00:49:48,020 --> 00:50:21,740
like a core strategy of like observing

00:49:49,760 --> 00:50:24,490
the running system yeah pretty cool yeah

00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:27,170
I'm sure that was very challenging the

00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:28,370
so yeah my experience so far and one of

00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,260
the things I am excited about being a

00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:33,020
lending home is being now in the

00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,310
different position right so the last

00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,960
couple of years was very I was very

00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:38,720
focused on trying to leave those traces

00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,890
build those trails and now kind of going

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,240
into a different different kind of world

00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:43,040
being dropped into a new new jungle

00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:47,210
basically and trying to find my way

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,500
around it's kind of exciting and I'd

00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:52,030
like to had a comment about the general

00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:55,130
topic which is a lot of the ways I'm

00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:56,510
distinguishing between doing legacy

00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:59,210
systems and other systems we are

00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:00,530
currently writing legacy systems and so

00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,110
six up to me is that this is the way of

00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:06,470
avoiding having made these legacy

00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:08,270
systems that are impenetrable so or one

00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:11,150
legacy systems and then there's legacy

00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:12,650
systems right so like the classic

00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:14,690
Michael Feathers definition is like so

00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:16,040
you know a software system without tests

00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:17,240
right so when you're dropped into a

00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,220
place and you've got like no tests

00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,870
around it and you also don't really know

00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,900
the code at all that's way different

00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:26,270
than oh what do you wrote this oh god it

00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:28,940
was me like six weeks ago right that's a

00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:31,060
different kind of legacy I think and I

00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:46,130
think what what these gentlemen were

00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:47,750
referring to science between

00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:51,620
understanding something and being able

00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:52,850
to compress it in your mind to analogize

00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,590
of a computer and this feels very

00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:56,170
relevant

00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:57,760
like those diagrams of cetera those are

00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:59,830
helping people develop that mental

00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,990
compression that goes with understanding

00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:03,850
something yeah that sounds really

00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:12,910
