"""
Documenting architecture design decisions is commonly considered a good practice and yet many teams don't take the time to write down the decisions they make. In our experience this happens for a few reasons: documentation is rejected as being too heavyweight, documentation has little influence since it is typically out of sight and out of mind, and many developers donâ€™t know what to document. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) address many of these problems by capturing design decisions in simple, lightweight templates that are stored close to repositories used by stakeholders -- often in the same repository as code affected by the ADR.

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to write effective ADRs and how to overcome road bumps teams often experience when first getting started with ADRs. By the end of this session, you will have the skills you need to champion ADRs and help your team start (or improve) your design decision log.

	00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,799
all right how's everybody doing tonight

00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,910
over there it's right in the bright

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,000
light okay

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,530
hey welcome yeah I guess you guys have

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,179
me like tucked in the corner a little

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,160
bit I'm used to walking around but this

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,410
will be okay yeah so tonight we're going

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,840
to talk about architecture decision

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,020
records and really what I hope by the

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,260
end of this session that everyone feels

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,650
comfortable creating creating decision

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,420
records documenting your decisions and

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,500
basically having having a good enough

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,930
handle on it to be able to take you to

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,239
your team and show them what to do -

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,520
because it's a really fantastic practice

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,129
so what we're gonna do tonight so we're

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,420
gonna start off with some theory bits

00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:43,860
covering kind of some of the basics what

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,809
is an architecture decision record and

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,010
you know how can I help your team that

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,449
and hopefully about half of our time

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,399
tonight maybe a little bit more it's

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,620
gonna be spent actually doing so we're

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,199
gonna take some time to to try it out

00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,969
and you know share them with these share

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,039
them with each other learn what works

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,870
what doesn't and get some prep or some

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,250
real practice and kind of a you know

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,170
sandbox where it doesn't matter so much

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,610
so that's the that's the plan this

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,170
evening I feel like I'm getting some

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,150
feedback are you are you all okay out

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,619
there okay awesome

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,930
great so here's a motivating example a

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:21,659
100% hypothetical thing that actually

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,979
happened in real life so you know all

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,960
the tests fail when I run them what's

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,090
going on yeah about that

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,500
so we decided only to support us to sell

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,939
yesterday and now all of our test

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,460
doubles are you know requiring

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,740
certificates I thought you knew when did

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,450
we decide that all right so big decision

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
was made that fundamentally changed the

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,369
development environment I had no idea

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,899
what was going on you know some kind of

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,909
a disconnect within our team except for

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,970
these kinds of things seem to happen you

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:51,149
know somewhat regularly right when

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,470
everything is working well most of teams

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,570
should operate kind of like Voltron

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,719
right you got all different people doing

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,610
their thing and when everybody is coming

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,860
along you know they come together to

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,890
form this amazing awesome robot right so

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,619
everybody's an individual within there

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,509
doing their thing but somehow you're

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,720
able to form one mind right and become

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,470
this one this one piece right leg is the

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,410
case

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:22,320
maybe so we need to make decisions so

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:24,840
that we can move forward right but even

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,390
if we're making decisions we can't move

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,400
fast unless everybody understands ok so

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,960
there's kind of two pieces to that just

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,150
saying that you're going to do something

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,970
isn't necessarily good enough you have

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,240
to get that idea out there and everyone

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,740
has to comprehend what's going on a kind

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,410
of a common way this goes down on my

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,670
teams is you know gather around everyone

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,640
and let me tell you about the

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:52,470
architecture right we've got a very

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,540
strong very strong tradition of oral

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,890
storytelling right we'll get at the

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,440
whiteboard will jot down some notes

00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,550
we'll just kind of tell tell about you

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,040
know what happened over the past week

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,410
things like that oral history is

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,270
fantastic I think it's really a great

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,800
way to share design design decisions

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,390
that you're making especially while

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,920
you're still exploring right so if

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,060
things are churning if things are going

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,270
very fast

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,410
taking the time to write stuff down well

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,140
it's gonna be out of date you know

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,380
sometimes within minutes so there's a

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,570
time in the place for that oral history

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,910
has other limitations as well so it

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,030
generally has short reach I can only

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,170
spread the good word of our design to

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,150
the people who are there at the time

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,769
right so we have you know two members of

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,900
your team at a whiteboard that's as far

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,470
as the ideas are gonna go they're not

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,060
gonna get take it much further

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,560
the yeah

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,019
leads to something very time-consuming

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,980
to share so you have to go basically

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,030
point to point and communicate what what

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,340
the architecture is and how you're

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,810
sharing it and quite frankly it changes

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,340
every time you tell the story right so

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,580
it's kind of organically evolving over

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,680
time and if you don't constantly refresh

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,220
you're gonna forget people start to to

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,420
forget and memories fade with that in

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,500
mind eventually we do need to write

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,940
something down and that's really what

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,780
the decision records technique is all

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:16,440
about lots of ways we write stuff down

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,390
so a really fantastic technique is to

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,740
capture these design decisions and

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:24,810
things like that in the code you don't

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,880
see here code is lossy when it comes to

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,360
things like rationale right so it's

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,189
really

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,379
good or it can be very good at structure

00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:32,909
but it's not necessarily gonna tell you

00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,259
why something happened or the history of

00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:36,150
how you arrived at a certain place

00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,699
there's techniques for kind of getting

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,310
around that but by and large code is

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:45,870
good but not necessarily sufficient in

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,849
all cases wiki's you know documents does

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,759
everybody have like a Google Drive or a

00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:55,610
box or something like that or you just

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:57,930
dump everything yeah it can be tough I

00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,879
got an email on here I don't know that

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,460
anyone on my team sends email anymore

00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,389
which is kind of amusing but my favorite

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,039
technique though never erase the

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:06,930
whiteboards so you just always jot it up

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,300
there and you leave everything just in

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,610
the environment all the time which

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,810
eventually leads to not being able to

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,560
erase the right boards anymore which is

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,840
different kind of problem but all these

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,409
things are great but it really depends

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:26,189
on I guess how good they are depends on

00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:27,449
what you put into them right so oral

00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:28,919
history alone is not going to be

00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:32,009
sufficient although you can get pretty

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,960
far with it writing stuff down is great

00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,610
but you got to capture the right things

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,710
when you put them in there okay

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,580
so let's go ahead and dive into that a

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:43,650
little bit architecture decision records

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,270
and yeah we'll start with the a just to

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,330
make sure we're all kind of on the same

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:55,409
page the architecture part so here's a

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:57,900
here's a definition right so software

00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:59,849
architecture is the set of significant

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,729
design decisions about how the software

00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:07,830
is organized to promote desired quality

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:10,110
attributes and other properties let's

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,419
dissect this for a sec I guess before we

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,830
do that quality attributes does

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,020
everybody know what a quality attribute

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,199
is or

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,189
I'll just define it real quick the this

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,120
is basically the bread and butter of

00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:22,620
architecture we're talking about the

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,229
elytis some people call them

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,150
non-functional requirements or quality

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,060
requirements really what you're trying

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,439
to do is qualify how well a certain

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,150
design does something or how will your

00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:39,569
software it does something not what it

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:40,949
does okay so you can take a say a

00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:45,090
calculator app

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:48,360
it has a feature to add right to numbers

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,629
right but let's say it let's say it

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,069
takes 10 minutes to do that right you

00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:54,599
know maybe you have a performance

00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:57,090
problem maybe you should have designed

00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,530
it to add better you're still getting

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,319
the right answer it's functionally

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,819
correct but the the qualities of that

00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,409
particular calculator are her rather

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,580
poor things like reliability what if it

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,759
just randomly gives the wrong answer

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:15,300
sometimes you know every every tenth

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,620
time or something you know you might be

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,840
functionally correct but the reliability

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,879
is very poor in that case so we can

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,990
design for those types of things that's

00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,650
what the architecture is really all

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,990
about those quality attributes are

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,969
leading to help us decide how the

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,110
software is organized right and what

00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:35,129
we're talking about there are things

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,419
like structures okay all right so this

00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:38,099
is kind of the theory bits but a

00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,900
structure is basically an element in a

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,189
relation you take a brick in the mortar

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,560
you know the peanut butter and the bread

00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:46,199
you slam them together and then that's

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,479
how you end up with a structure so

00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,159
anytime you're drawing boxes and lines

00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:51,930
boxes basically are elements in most

00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:54,930
cases lines are going to be your

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,550
relations all right in retrospect I

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:03,000
should have put some examples that are a

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:05,849
bit more concrete the layers right so in

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,860
a layered style architecture your layer

00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:09,930
is an element and then there is an

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,089
allowed to use relation that tells you

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:18,479
which layers are allowed to use which

00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:20,490
other layers it's a super theory maybe

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,710
not quite practical way of describing a

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,240
way of thinking about these things in

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,189
that particular example not very

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,810
interesting but as things grow it can

00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:32,789
become a very helpful technique so with

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,649
these like with these elements and

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,539
relations lots of different ways to

00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:39,240
combine them right so these are all

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,940
mammals I think yeah

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,380
lots of different ways you can combine

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:48,240
bones and muscle to create different

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,600
kinds of animals different structures

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,920
involved in each one yeah where I guess

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,470
in the case of that weird picture of no

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,040
structure at all

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,600
so don't do that alright just to dive a

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,610
little bit deeper on this one

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,040
typically with architecture we like to

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,970
think about it in terms of the three

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,300
different types of things or three

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:11,900
different buckets so things like here's

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,320
here's my examples things like so your

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,210
module would be the design time stuff so

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,350
that is things you can see in a file

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:25,310
when you open it up right classes

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:27,080
packages layers things like that that's

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,690
one kind of type of structure that we

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,630
deal with component connectors dealing

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,160
with runtime structures right so you

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,360
take that class and you instantiate it

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,070
you don't have a class anymore you have

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,600
an object right you have a thing that is

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,860
running in memory okay that's a

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,290
different kind of structure that we're

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,220
dealing with so yeah objects tears

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:48,200
processes threads it's it's a different

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,020
different set of different set of

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,890
elements different set of relations and

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,050
lets you deal with different quality

00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,600
attributes as well and then finally the

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,850
last bucket is allocation the last type

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,250
that we deal with this allocation

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,930
basically your mapping from one one of

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,560
these types to another so for module two

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:10,420
component in connector or sometimes from

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,880
from these things into the real world so

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,100
some typical examples would be if you're

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,420
deploying to a server or if you're you

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,640
know installing onto a container or

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,480
something like that that server that

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,580
container is a physical thing right

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,530
even people right can be an element in

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,260
this world if you have team a you know

00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:32,330
working on component you know foo that's

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,960
that's a good example of an allocation

00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,580
style thing all right that's probably

00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,020
the the most theoretical this is going

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,420
to be and then we're going to get super

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:46,370
practical after this everybody don't

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,050
know okay all right cool all right ad

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:52,070
are the D do use for decision that

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:54,320
should be pretty obvious so looking back

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,310
at the definition with architecture

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,350
typically we're talking about

00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,950
significant decisions not every little

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,180
thing that you could possibly do so

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,370
don't maybe you don't necessarily care

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,140
what the names your methods are maybe

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,240
we're looking more coarse-grained than

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,040
that right maybe a seer and arrange

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,690
of classes or even arrangement of

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,980
packages something more significant all

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:20,420
right what does that mean exactly so

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,730
yeah back to that idea of quality

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,620
attributes so if you are influencing

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,899
something like scalability reliability

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,330
availability you know maintainability

00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,470
testability on and on and on those are

00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,790
the types of things that we really care

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,100
about and those are the types of

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,380
decisions that should probably be

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,240
captured in some way for from an

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,310
architecture perspective if you're

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,959
impacting the costs or the schedule in a

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,830
meaningful sort of way those are good

00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:47,899
things that are probably architectural

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,580
yeah internal or I'm sorry external

00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,930
organizations if a decision that you're

00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,180
making is going to cause some other team

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,370
to do work maybe you ought to talk about

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,640
that and write it down

00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:01,640
one way that I want to say this comes

00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,899
from Amazon thinking about things in

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,149
terms of like two-way doors and one-way

00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:06,860
doors if this is a decision and you make

00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,510
it and there's no coming back that is

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,660
going to be way more significant than

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,520
something that can be easily undone so

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:19,070
that's another way another way

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,779
potentially of thinking about that yeah

00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:25,010
we'll just stop there so yeah it's good

00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:26,810
all right examples so responsibility so

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,250
you know component X is responsible for

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,770
doing something in this case sending

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,630
email you've assigned a responsibility

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,250
you just made an architectural decision

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,690
right there by saying that that

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,459
component is going to be the thing that

00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:42,140
sends the email implications of stuff so

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:44,209
you know oh because we did whatever

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,640
decision now things are going to be more

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:49,339
difficult to test okay so you just

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,390
influence testability that is something

00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:54,770
that might be worth discussing as a team

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,029
third-party library dependencies always

00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,570
a good call especially if you have to

00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:03,100
pay for them always something you should

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:05,750
think about a bit then possibly capture

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,490
let's see here moving packages or

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,399
modules around if you're doing major

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,450
refactor it's potentially architectural

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,760
in nature that's coming back to that

00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:18,520
module style structure tech debt

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,900
managing tech debt is definitely a

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,890
something that architects should be

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,690
thinking about

00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:26,180
if you're making strategic decisions

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,850
doing the wrong thing on purpose that is

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,350
sometimes you know something that that

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:34,610
you ought to capture or think about

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:36,380
capturing I guess this last example if

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,269
whatever you're doing causes everybody

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:41,420
to have to like redo their entire

00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:44,680
environment if or if you're restricting

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:50,089
or changing freedoms or things like that

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:52,579
potentially architectural right so yeah

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:57,730
I can't think of a real example but oh

00:13:52,579 --> 00:14:01,760
here's one so we just recently redid the

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,200
the web web pack build processes that

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:10,850
caused everybody to have to bump in a

00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:12,440
certain way and do call call the the

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,740
build processes in a certain way that

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,180
was different than what it was before

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,850
net result was huge it improved build

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,680
times a lot but it did have a pretty

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:26,630
significant impact across across the

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:31,570
organization all right last but not

00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:34,130
least the are part the record okay so

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,660
this technique that we're gonna learn

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,790
tonight that we're talking about comes

00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,839
from Michael Nygaard he was the author

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:44,260
of release it and I guess back in 2011

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:47,570
here with this blog post that defined

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,370
architecture decision records as well a

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,529
short text file similar to an

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,180
Alexandrian pattern that describes a set

00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:57,620
of forces and a single decision in

00:14:53,180 --> 00:15:01,940
response to those forces so the key bits

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:05,029
of this are basically we're talking

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:08,420
about small discrete you know simple

00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:13,160
easy to read text files a set of forces

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:17,029
so that is the state of the world the

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,970
facts of nature the facts of life that

00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:21,110
are influencing some decision that you

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,779
care about and that's really all it

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,370
comes down to the Alexandrian pattern

00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,430
stuff is super interesting if you want

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,260
to go deeper Christopher Alexander is a

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,240
fascinating person who has nothing to do

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,470
with software but we totally steal from

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,540
him all the time so

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:42,420
yeah you should check out his his books

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,680
if you're into design types of stuff I

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,510
the Oregon experiment I think is one of

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,220
the big ones

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:52,180
basically defined what we would call

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:55,060
modern building code stuff like that

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,640
all right so 80 yards what it comes down

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,010
to you define the context that is kind

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,930
of the state of the world you record

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,940
your decision and then as a result of

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,670
that applying that decision there are

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,890
consequences and this in a nutshell is

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:13,840
also how you define any pattern which is

00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:15,640
pretty cool yeah contexts are kind of

00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,020
the forces of play your decision the

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,000
thing that you want to have implanted

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,480
and then as a result of that like the

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,500
consequences that that come out and this

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,390
is kind of what they look like so this

00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:30,100
is an ADR from a project that I was on

00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:31,420
at one point pretty simple and we'll

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,570
dive into this so you can actually read

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,860
it use the pipe and filter library so

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,510
pipe and filter is a particular

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,770
architecture pattern ER and we're all

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,120
we're saying is we've got a library that

00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:44,680
implements it and we're going to use it

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,890
right that's the decision so the the

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,690
context the forces at play

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,340
these are stated as facts upfront

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,080
try and use plain language don't want to

00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,240
get too flowery and this one is all

00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,570
about talking let's see here this is

00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,830
talking about things like well in the

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,050
past we're writing things that were

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,660
called agents basically small processes

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,510
that have a single task we thought it

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:12,070
was a good idea to use pipes and filters

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:14,650
but our engineers who actually design

00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:16,510
that system left on vacation and then

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:21,160
everybody else just mangled the heck out

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:23,410
of the original code base so that led

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,760
Joe one of our teammates to write a

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,250
library that would help us better

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:32,050
enforce the pattern and that library

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:33,670
exists all right so we're gonna use that

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,980
library that's all we're saying there is

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:39,970
we're gonna use it the status bit is

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,280
interesting so status is basically

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,230
saying that you can

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,150
well decisions change over time right so

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,520
in this case we've accepted it as a team

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,660
but maybe a couple weeks from now or

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,640
Monsoor now you're going to change your

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,290
mind you don't delete the record you

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,510
keep it and you're just updated status

00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,960
so you kind of have almost like in a an

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:01,210
event stream right a decision log

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,610
building up over time so you can have

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,640
historical context so that's that's what

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:09,220
that status is all about yeah I could

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,260
accept it deprecated basically create

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:15,190
creature own whatever's useful teams do

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:17,410
lots of things for that all right

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,000
consequences so as a result of that

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,860
applying that decision we're gonna use

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,410
that library these are all the things

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:29,470
that happen both good and bad all right

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:32,230
so let's see here so yeah Oh a good

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,630
thing we even improved our testability

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,710
all the filters are completely decoupled

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,540
it's easier to maintain

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,610
oh wow concurrency we're gonna improve

00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,780
our performance lots of really awesome

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:45,310
stuff going on some bad stuff

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,900
Oh know if there's uncon trace

00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,300
conditions you know we could have major

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,730
failures because we're not as confident

00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,350
in libraries we should be and we've

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,940
restricted the world a little bit

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,070
logging is going to be more difficult

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,210
for us right so we chose to get all

00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,620
these good things but then there were

00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:05,080
also some bad consequences that came

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:08,380
with it trade-offs right okay so yeah

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,880
capturing decisions as we as we are

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,020
making those decisions lets us build up

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:18,160
this decision log over time so that same

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:19,930
that same ADR it was number well okay

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,640
this is a different list this is

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,800
actually the old old one that we were

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,180
deprecating but you can see that we

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,490
started off with a simple you know tech

00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,370
we're gonna use golang for for writing

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,290
this stuff and we're gonna use this gogo

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,090
convey'd thing for testing and we're

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,890
gonna use our pipe and filters we're

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,680
gonna you know run some stuff on timers

00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:41,340
you can see over time how how everything

00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:44,340
is coming together which is pretty cool

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,340
yes

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:59,580
yeah so ideally you would keep the

00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:02,010
decision that you have and you would add

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,440
a new one that you can then reference to

00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:08,130
say hey we used to use go there's some

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,260
we are using go at the moment the team

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,910
liked it didn't like you know likes it

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,230
doesn't like it we've experienced these

00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,230
problems or these benefits that's your

00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:19,020
context right and you can reference the

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,660
original decision that you oh yeah we we

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,190
chose to use go and then you're gonna

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,160
make a new decision I don't know we're

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,960
gonna use you know Kotlin or something

00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:34,380
right sticking your new your new hotness

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,490
there yeah so in that case I would

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,750
change the status in the first one to

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,309
say it's deprecated and I would even add

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,679
like a two-way link in that you know in

00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:42,059
that case really with this kind of stuff

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,679
in I guess you can see that we're

00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,570
storing it in github here we were

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,610
storing it in the same repository as the

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,580
code but that's not necessarily a

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,920
requirement in this case easier for us

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,220
as developers so that's where they

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,870
landed yeah but generally so by doing

00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,460
that you create history and now you

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,110
don't have to go off and write more

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,240
documents to capture that rationale you

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:25,830
can kind of almost play back the history

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:27,500
which is pretty pretty powerful I've

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:33,000
done all those things

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:34,200
yeah let's come back to that and I can

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,460
share some more stuff if there's

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,360
interest in that on kind of like

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,950
different things that have worked

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,309
experiments we've tried stuff like that

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,730
the answer is yes you can do all those

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,610
things

00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:46,020
so the best thing might be to try some

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,020
stuff out and see something that works

00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,640
for your team and unfortunately there's

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:54,000
like pros and cons like they they all

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,800
they all were good yeah want to pause

00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,450
here any other questions or stuff I've

00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:01,650
kind of been rolling through and what

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,520
I've asked of course everyone you know

00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,520
quiets down

00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,769
a little bit of both yeah a little bit

00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,239
about so sometimes we'll create these

00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:25,379
things up front is a proposal we'll

00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:26,969
float it around see what happens

00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:29,940
sometimes it gets you know rejected by

00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:32,279
the team and that's okay because that

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,619
kind of path that we didn't choose to go

00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:35,940
down now becomes a part of the reason or

00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,999
the rationale leading to the actual

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:41,279
decision that we do choose people also

00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:44,759
get super frustrated when their stuff

00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:47,039
gets rejected like that so we tended to

00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,479
I guess on the teams that I'm on we tend

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,690
to talk about things a lot informally

00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:53,219
and then captured after the fact but I

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,330
don't know it all depends kind of the

00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:58,379
size of the organization that's not

00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,729
practical in a lot of cases so on my

00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:02,639
small team that works well but when I

00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:05,159
bubble up to you know 30 40 people or

00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:20,070
more the proposal process is really the

00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:21,989
only way to go that's interesting so

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:26,279
I'll go I'm gonna mention this person

00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:28,830
again later but there's a guy Ken power

00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,710
and I'll give you a link for his his

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,029
stuff has been doing a lot of research

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,330
into different ways that people use a

00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:37,379
DRS and different ways that people use

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,269
decision records and that is one of the

00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:41,519
things that he has looked into is you

00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:43,619
know we said we're gonna do a thing did

00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,109
we actually do it and adding you know I

00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:49,859
think in the template that I showed you

00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:51,839
guys showed you all it's a very very

00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:52,859
simple and straightforward he's been

00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,139
experimenting with doing more things

00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:56,159
like what was the mood of the team what

00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:58,499
was the follow-up and how did we

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,639
actually like it did we see the positive

00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:01,379
and negative consequences that we

00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:02,999
actually wanted I think there's a lot of

00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:05,269
cool room for experimentation with this

00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:05,269
technique

00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:17,620
it's a hope of yeah kind of what we

00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:18,730
expect to happen yeah in its what you're

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,029
trying to do is capture the trade-offs

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:24,009
you know we this is the world today we

00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:26,350
chose to do this thing now as a result

00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:31,480
of that this is what we expect to you

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:32,649
know be the new world yeah so my future

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:54,759
tense could be a good way to think about

00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:56,769
it see what I got here

00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:00,100
we're gonna go rogue we don't need

00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:02,139
slides see what else I got for ya so I

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,970
do want to get to that exercise but

00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:14,110
these are all awesome questions so I'm

00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:16,120
going to front-load some stuff here what

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:18,759
do I have

00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,529
yeah so let's go and pop over here whole

00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:21,789
pop to the end and we'll jump around and

00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:23,580
I'll even pull in some other other

00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:27,279
presentations and stuff if we need to

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:29,470
yeah so getting it out to different

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,149
stakeholders so we were using github in

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:35,490
this case we just integrated in with the

00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:37,779
pull request system right so it was a

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,700
house it announced well here you go

00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:42,519
here's a PR and we invite your feedback

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,870
and comments and that that's the way

00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,539
that we handled it on this particular

00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,950
team not all of your stakeholders you're

00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:50,649
gonna do code right not everybody's

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,429
going to be in github in that case you

00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,320
got to kind of go where your

00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:55,539
stakeholders are so if they're using I

00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,950
don't know SharePoint or something

00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:58,360
you'll have to figure out a way to kind

00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:01,330
of get documents in a space where

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,730
they're able to use it that might be

00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,080
more difficult or clunky but it's far

00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,710
better for people to kind of see the

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,789
stuff than to not use it at all yeah I

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,289
think that's the key context really

00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:12,490
close to where it's used is like the

00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:16,570
main thing that you're gonna you know

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:18,640
that you want to try and find so well

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:23,559
the kind of stuff do I have here so

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:25,420
Oh No I've done it yeah maybe we can

00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:29,290
talk about this stuff we're all pulling

00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:31,210
some other things in a minute so I've

00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:35,020
got some other data that I can share on

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,720
how we've used a DRS for growing skills

00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:41,049
on the team so it's kind of a fantastic

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,030
technique for that basically these are

00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:44,980
small little discreet things that you

00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:49,179
can delegate to anybody on your team

00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,470
right so junior senior whatever so I use

00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:52,960
it a lot for kind of coaching and

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,880
training opportunities we might work

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,010
together a pair on making the decision

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,970
but then you know hey why don't you go

00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,320
up and document it you know I've

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,400
documented the last one so you do this

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,590
one yeah super easy review the cost of

00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,720
failure very very low right even if it

00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,100
takes two or three revisions it's just a

00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,870
document right it's not the end of the

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:15,549
world yeah fantastic for kind of pairing

00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:18,910
and stuff like that

00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:22,510
in terms of how to go about the peer

00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:23,590
review basically you want to try and get

00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,290
the whole team involved as much as

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,460
possible so I'm a huge fan of

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,809
decentralizing design Authority so

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,250
instead of having kind of one person in

00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:32,049
charge that's kind of telling everybody

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,460
what to do this is all about leveling

00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:35,620
the whole team up and this is a

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:39,250
mechanism that you can do that you can

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:41,110
use to do that so let's see here I have

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,730
seen examples where and kind of

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,110
experienced where you know coming in to

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,760
work one day and I overhear it's like oh

00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,950
yeah yeah that's something let's make an

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,299
AVR for that it's like yes it's working

00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:53,290
right it feels really good

00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:55,150
people can go off and make decisions on

00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:57,760
their own and then we have a mechanism

00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:59,500
for bringing it back so that everybody

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,809
can be aware including you know your

00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:05,380
tech leads or whoever is kind of making

00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:06,400
sure things stay on the rails for that

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,910
to work though you kind of have to make

00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,500
it a habit so yeah you want to hear that

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,390
phrase or you want to be asking that

00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,160
phrase to kind of help train people when

00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,960
you're when these significant decisions

00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,700
are happening asking the question and

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,400
we're kind of prodding or prompting hey

00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,640
do we need an ADR for that a very very

00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,590
easy way to do it

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,850
tracking you hours in the backlog so I

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,990
don't know I stick anything in the

00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,390
backlog that I want my team to think

00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,230
about so if we said we want to do an ADR

00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,059
for something then

00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,250
let's make it visible on our board and

00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:38,140
let's make sure that people actually are

00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,510
held accountable to making it making it

00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,380
a thing

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,640
lots of templates out there I've got

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,770
another link that I can share with

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,780
everybody for tons of different

00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,940
templates that have been used but you

00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,340
want to have a template something I've

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,110
been trying recently is ADR parties so

00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,290
every Friday at 2:00 we get together for

00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:59,230
a half hour and just churn out 80 ours I

00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:21,610
guess it's not much of a party but it's

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:24,820
it's fun yes so in the template that I

00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:31,990
use let's see if I can find it here we

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:34,150
have this list so we've got a template

00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,990
like this which shows I'll make this big

00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,740
so everybody can see it

00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:40,240
a little bit better so this is just a

00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,070
markdown template and it's telling you

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,870
all the stuff that I'm telling you like

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:49,270
what is context what is a decision right

00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,700
you know the section describes a

00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:56,880
response to the forces and stated in an

00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,880
active voice we will dot dot dot right

00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:02,830
that's that's the format and then along

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:06,340
with that there's other stuff around it

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:13,690
to kind of teach just in time one of the

00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:17,370
things that we include is this list here

00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:19,150
which is kind of rules of thumb what are

00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,700
what are the things that we think are

00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:24,490
significant on our team so if you see

00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,780
one of these things come up then you

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,140
should think twice and maybe record an

00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,000
ADR

00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,309
and maybe you have a different list for

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,809
your team or maybe not everybody

00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:34,540
understands exactly what this means

00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:36,100
right and that's ok too it takes time to

00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:42,700
kind of build up the knowledge or

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:44,500
whatever examples too so I usually end

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,419
up writing the first I don't know five

00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,900
or six on a new team five or six eight

00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:52,780
yards on a new team first by myself then

00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,909
pairing getting reviews as we go and

00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,290
then starting to delegate so there's no

00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:59,679
there's also kind of a ramp up period in

00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:05,799
that way does that answer your question

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:09,610
a bit ok cool cool so I don't I don't

00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:11,080
know we're just hopping around so why

00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,400
don't we do this let's just get to and

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,500
try and write a couple of these things

00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:24,940
and see how it works out is that cool

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:27,850
with everybody all right blah blah blah

00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,290
all right practice time let's do it and

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,309
I'll dig up some more stuff since there

00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,500
seems to be like interest in different

00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:34,090
different aspects of things so what

00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,409
we're gonna do tonight is work in pairs

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,390
or small groups and if you don't want to

00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:41,220
that's cool too you can work by yourself

00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:44,230
or not at all participation is optional

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:48,370
the prompt is we're going to design a

00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:49,900
smart toaster all right it's gonna

00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,500
perfectly toys toast your bread it's

00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,980
voice-activated

00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,360
learned your breakfast preferences and I

00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,330
don't know it's connected to the

00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,159
internet because why not and we're going

00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,049
to create a little decision log tonight

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,669
so probably two maybe three decisions

00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:04,900
depending on how much time we have get

00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:06,130
some practice and we'll kind of share

00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,440
and talk about the decisions that were

00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,610
writing down as we go and then I'm

00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,909
really sad to report this is a real

00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:17,620
product I didn't make this up so it's an

00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:18,880
actual thing pay the bills I don't know

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,970
why you'd want your toast to tell you

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,510
that but he looks really happy about it

00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:27,040
so ground rules for this just to make

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,179
sure we're all kind of on the same page

00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,730
here there really are no right or wrong

00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:32,770
answers we're just exploring tonight

00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:34,720
right so we're just trying things out I

00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,880
don't actually have any idea how much

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,530
time is left but I will try and keep an

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,510
eye on the clock and if you all could

00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,650
help me with that too it's a pretty

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,610
small group so we should be fine with

00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,350
that

00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:47,710
yeah you're already asking questions

00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:50,380
just keep it rolling and the prompt is

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,340
super duper vague so use your experience

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,470
to fill in some gaps

00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,490
I'm not telling you exactly what to do

00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,410
but use your

00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:00,130
nation and your experience to kind of

00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:02,110
get the most out of the exercise for you

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,700
and yeah have fun with it if you're not

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,460
having fun maybe you're doing it wrong

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,690
mr. Pete this should be a little fun the

00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,040
end result should look I don't know

00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,179
something like this and I've got pencil

00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,210
and paper up here you're free to use a

00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:14,080
laptop or whatever you want to record

00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,970
these things but we're just going to

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,980
create a two-yard so the same thing I

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:20,500
just showed you title context decision

00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:25,900
consequences that's that's pretty much

00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:33,000
all there is to it alright questions

00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:39,280
before we get started yes absolutely

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,330
absolutely all right so meet your team

00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,120
so if you could take a couple minutes

00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:46,300
self-organized into small groups or on

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,590
your own if you want meet somebody and

00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,590
I've got a pencil

00:34:38,179 --> 00:36:02,430
more like structure right so it will not

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,450
be a test later so you can make up new

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,450
features if you want to

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,839
alright looks like everybody's doing

00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:21,069
pretty well there so your first task so

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,839
we got to build some context real quick

00:36:21,069 --> 00:36:24,670
amongst your team so our first task that

00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:26,319
we're gonna do about seven minutes give

00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:28,359
or take you need to actually kind of

00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:29,470
design your system and obviously you're

00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:31,960
not gonna be able to design the whole

00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:34,569
thing but you can create a context

00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,270
diagram you can invent some stuff for

00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:38,920
how a smart toaster might work choose

00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:41,140
whatever area interests you or maybe

00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,790
where your experiences if you're an

00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,619
embedded you know systems programmer

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,390
maybe you want to go and talk about

00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,099
stuff in the toaster if you're more of a

00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,240
cloud IT person maybe you want to talk

00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:50,740
about the components and how they come

00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,690
together if you don't know what any of

00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:55,780
that stuff is I don't know make

00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:57,730
something else up it's totally fine yeah

00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,170
so lean on your experience for this a

00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,910
general context diagram is probably

00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,349
enough if you're struggling sprinkle in

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,089
some buzzwords and you will probably

00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:05,260
arrive that's something that will help

00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:08,440
us for the next part of the exercise

00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:12,329
so yeah about seven minutes give or take

00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,329
and go

00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,909
[Music]

00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,429
[Music]

00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,309
[Music]

00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,159
[Music]

00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:49,380
all right good

00:44:46,020 --> 00:45:03,930
take another take another minute wrap up

00:44:49,380 --> 00:45:05,579
we're gonna move on all right so for

00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,230
this first one because I'm not sure

00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,339
where everybody is with everything we're

00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,720
gonna break this down we're gonna do

00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:13,819
this in steps for this very first one

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,819
training wheels right so it's all good

00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:20,220
you'll be you'll be good so task number

00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:23,970
two all right

00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,750
or maybe three I've lost count the first

00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,250
thing we're going to do is make a

00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,930
decision and I know that might sound a

00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,980
little bit backwards based on some of

00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,650
the things we were talking about because

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,059
it's in the middle but this is really

00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,319
the basis for trying to decide what

00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:37,049
context we're going to want to talk

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:39,420
about so take about three minutes as a

00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:40,589
group pick one of the one of the things

00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,220
that you talked about and let's just

00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:46,319
call it your first decision write it

00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,760
down you can just do a sketch if you

00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,080
want eventually though I were going to

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,210
want to see it in the

00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:54,690
kind of active imperative voice you know

00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:56,580
we will do this thing think about some

00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,360
of the the ideas around significance

00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,770
that we were talking about in the

00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,070
beginning is it an architectural kind of

00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:03,390
thing

00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:05,430
right so um yeah you know not you know

00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:07,710
or we're gonna use camel casing for all

00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,990
the method names but you know maybe you

00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:11,460
know does this influence a quality

00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:14,280
attribute or a key functional

00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,020
requirement and something like that and

00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,580
yeah keep it brief so we're looking for

00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,050
like maybe one sentence if you can get

00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:23,810
it down to a pithy phrase that that is

00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,810
really what the ideal is yeah

00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,099
[Music]

00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:39,610
does does everybody have at least one

00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:41,410
decision I already have one decision

00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:44,880
anybody feel comfortable sharing your

00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,880
decision that you're gonna tackle first

00:48:45,210 --> 00:49:10,960
all right all right all right it seems

00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,880
is that significant do people think

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,980
that's a significant one or is it kind

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,790
of not very meeting yeah it seems

00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:20,590
significant seems very significant any

00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:24,119
does anybody else feel feel like sharing

00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,119
their decision that they're gonna

00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:45,010
interesting okay all right good examples

00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,810
all right so next up we're gonna do

00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:48,100
context I've got seven minutes here

00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,940
people are cruising pretty quick so I

00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,630
don't think we're gonna need that much

00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,890
time but yeah basically so we at least

00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,660
have kind of like put a boundary around

00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,760
what it is that we think is important

00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,310
we've decided what's significant so the

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,560
next step is context what are the forces

00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:04,960
at play what are the facts of the world

00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:08,410
that we need to kind of share about this

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,730
this type of decision were there any

00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,200
alternatives you considered or are there

00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:12,330
different things that that we're out

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,020
there that you were talking about

00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,119
generally we want to try and keep these

00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:19,060
things brief okay so the ADR itself is

00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:21,790
usually a page maybe two definitely no

00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:26,200
more less is less is better in a lot of

00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:27,460
cases for these okay yeah so context is

00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,070
going to be the next the next bit so

00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:34,810
statements of fact about the world that

00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,810
are the stage for this decision

00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:45,890
absolutely yeah so I'll link to other

00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:48,860
reference material blog posts whatever

00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:55,690
it is to kind of help get the idea kind

00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:55,690
of explain things yeah

00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:39,440
[Music]

00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:07,960
okay so let's do this let's do some

00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:09,520
sharing on this one so oh I'm sorry I

00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,030
guess I should ask how's everyone doing

00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:15,940
do you need more time or is that okay

00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:18,550
yeah okay all right let's do it

00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,500
who who's okay or who feels comfortable

00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:27,490
sharing your context that you came up

00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:30,240
with it's a friendly crowd it's all good

00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,240
oh thank you

00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:46,800
Alexa SDK and you will use this because

00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:50,950
of the speed to market proven accuracy

00:57:46,800 --> 00:58:00,760
user trust and the international markets

00:57:50,950 --> 00:58:03,280
that will have access to we have linked

00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,840
you to trust issues I'm sorry hold on

00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,460
we're still talking about context so

00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:08,890
yeah sorry I'm like we're going like

00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,780
baby steps right now but yeah head of

00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,250
the curtain that's cool but uh all right

00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:20,380
so what was like the read that context

00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:24,670
back again yeah this will help us Lee

00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:28,540
get to market faster okay and so it has

00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:31,450
like proven accuracy and kind of like a

00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:37,060
big ecosystem of users and testers and

00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:42,340
like we can hedge off of the Amazon like

00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:44,290
you know war chest and it will enable us

00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:46,300
to reach international markets as well

00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:49,210
okay cool

00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,200
all right so I guess I've got I've got

00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:51,790
some thoughts of you guys you're open to

00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,920
feedback on that but I'd like to hear

00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:55,890
what what everybody else think of that

00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,470
as a consequence

00:58:55,890 --> 00:59:36,710
[Music]

00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:38,300
or as a context fantastic yeah so with

00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:41,119
these two things I'm hearing a lot of

00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:42,530
quality attributes right so privacy is

00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,750
important right and you've got some

00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:46,069
statements about what that means the

00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,349
security is important some statements

00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:50,329
about what that means I think for your

00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:52,640
group you actually I heard it as a

00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:54,230
consequence if you back it up a little

00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,819
bit further time-to-market is important

00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:58,250
right like speed of delivery is

00:59:55,819 --> 00:59:59,750
important those are the facts right and

00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:02,869
even if you've been like reference stuff

00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:04,130
we're talking about before like I don't

01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:05,810
know maybe there's a memo from the VP

01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:07,520
that says you know we got to ship fast

01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:09,290
or something like that those are all

01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:12,560
really good facts to bring together to

01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:13,609
form your context a good technique and

01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,819
this is something I've seen lots of

01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:20,900
teams do or even myself as I'm going

01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:22,490
through it you know write down the

01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,079
context write down what you think the

01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:26,030
forces are give it another read through

01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,920
and then in some of those cases you

01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:30,560
ended up with consequences the things

01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,880
you want move them down to the

01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,740
consequences and then ask the next

01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,839
question well why why was that so

01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:38,150
important what led us to wanting that

01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,440
thing right because that is also super

01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:44,000
important that's really a rationale

01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,680
right yeah when I see that kind of stuff

01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,940
working working with teammates there's

01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,960
like a hidden assumption there that we

01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,940
want to get out into the open and that's

01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:55,609
that's why I probe on those types of

01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:56,390
things what else seen anybody else did

01:00:55,609 --> 01:01:00,680
that make sense to everyone

01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:03,140
okay cool

01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:06,619
all right well since we're doing baby

01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:07,730
steps here consequences is the last last

01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:09,290
step of this and it sounds like some

01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,460
people are bit ahead so we're gonna cut

01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,390
it a little bit shorter I wasn't sure

01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,120
how long

01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:16,580
how long folks would need so yeah with

01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,870
this it's really as a result of the

01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,470
decision that you've made how does the

01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:21,140
world change

01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:23,240
what what what changes as a result of

01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:24,830
the decision sometimes think about risks

01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,020
or think is about things that must be

01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:29,390
done now that you have put this thing in

01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,920
play you know did you create more work

01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:32,210
for yourself do you know how to do

01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,550
everything or do you have to go figure

01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:37,220
some stuff out and as a rule of thumb

01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:40,610
with this I look for at least three more

01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:42,320
is better and generally speaking the

01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:43,910
first couple that you come up with are

01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,030
probably going to be lame consequences

01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:48,230
I'll be perfectly perfectly honest it's

01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:49,760
when you start to get you know five six

01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:51,320
seven types of things

01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,550
all of a sudden interesting stuff pops

01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,660
out and those are the things that

01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:55,850
probably could have killed your project

01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:58,100
so it's really really start to dig that

01:01:55,850 --> 01:02:00,380
the the kind of neat stuff starts to

01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:02,690
come to light so yeah take a couple

01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:05,950
minutes and I'll learn a couple of

01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,950
consequences of your decision

01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:51,209
[Music]

01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:10,360
all right how's how's everybody doing -

01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:14,620
one more minute you know okay good now

01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:17,800
all right that's pretty solid you're

01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:20,710
good all right let's do it so do the

01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:23,710
same thing so so you've got your first

01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:25,420
ADR what were some of the consequences

01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:49,120
that you came up with as a result of

01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:51,520
your decision okay yeah so you're

01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:58,470
influencing the other other components

01:06:51,520 --> 01:07:02,230
within the overall fantastic okay yeah

01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:04,210
yeah so you've created created more work

01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:06,850
more cost you're going to have to get

01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:08,110
approvals for that or you know add had

01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,120
work for that support whatever group

01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:42,570
that is it's going to do the training

01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:49,960
yeah trust profiles wonderful okay cool

01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:52,180
all right so group in the back fight if

01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,380
I can pick on something you guys said

01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:55,030
earlier you were talking about like

01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:57,130
smees and things like that earlier right

01:07:55,030 --> 01:08:00,610
it was one of your context like you're

01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:01,810
assuming there's certain I guess people

01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:03,550
access to

01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:15,030
who know what's going on it was part of

01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:31,630
your context just moved it around yeah

01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:33,460
that's good though yeah it's a very

01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:40,900
positive consequence yeah good thing to

01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:43,089
call out awesome all right so let's see

01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:44,770
here what thirty rights we've got like

01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:46,000
fifteen fifty minutes all right I think

01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:48,839
we're gonna jump around a bit so I

01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,359
originally had us doing a second ADR

01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:53,650
which we could do if people want to do

01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:55,600
or I can share some other stuff about

01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:57,430
like how how putting this these things

01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:12,460
in practice we can kind of improvise a

01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:15,000
bit cool so let's see here so first of

01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:18,040
all I think a lot most of the patterns

01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,420
that I saw tonight from the things that

01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,859
everyone is sharing that's basically

01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:23,400
what a new person is going to go through

01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:25,750
so anyone who's kind of new to these

01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,970
adrs technique whether it's a junior

01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:29,020
person senior person whoever those are

01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:31,299
the types of things that people are

01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:34,750
gonna you know typically trip over kind

01:09:31,299 --> 01:09:37,780
of the format of it or like I've seen

01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:39,730
entire paragraphs as a decision you know

01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:41,380
taking all the consequences and the

01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:42,609
whole decision is just in the the

01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,319
context and then they're like well what

01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:46,750
am I supposed to work for consequences

01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,960
like okay well you know massage it break

01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:54,490
it down a little bit the and the reason

01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:55,570
for that kind of stuff is the this is

01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:58,390
meant to be a tool to kind of aid with

01:09:55,570 --> 01:10:00,970
thinking right is is really really the

01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:04,150
main part of it let's see what this one

01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:06,400
is I don't remember yeah it's pretty

01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:10,270
good okay so I've got a paper that's out

01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:14,880
that you can read on this stuff that

01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:14,880
talks about an adoption of a DRS

01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:21,400
for a system that looked kind of like

01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:23,020
that mostly there's probably not enough

01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:28,060
lines it got pretty you've got pretty

01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:29,679
gnarly things went hell and then we

01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:31,409
started bringing in ad ARS like we

01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:35,320
talked about tonight

01:10:31,409 --> 01:10:38,679
where's my graphs here we go it was

01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:41,290
about a two-year journey I think for

01:10:38,679 --> 01:10:42,940
leveling up the team okay so is serious

01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:46,139
investment in terms of coaching right

01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:48,880
this isn't like an overnight kind of fix

01:10:46,139 --> 01:10:50,860
this is what is this going back to 2016

01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,670
to 2018 so a two-year kind of case study

01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:56,550
at this part each let's say we're

01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:59,199
looking at people I can show a breakdown

01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:02,650
repository by like code modules if I can

01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:03,880
find that that slide deck in this

01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:05,530
particular talk we were interested in

01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,360
how well are we decentralizing design

01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:10,420
Authority so in the beginning it

01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,380
basically started with with me doing a

01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:15,639
lot of the work we kind of talked about

01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:16,780
that earlier so that was that was what I

01:11:15,639 --> 01:11:18,940
was doing I was kind of wrangling the

01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:20,440
team I was on boarding a lot of people

01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,790
do these concepts I was the one who was

01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,920
doing most of the documentation for this

01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:25,420
stuff I was basically the architect so

01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,830
it was a very hierarchical

01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:29,260
you know top-down sort of a model in

01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:31,239
that case as a result of that I

01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:35,590
basically didn't do anything else my

01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:36,429
code commits you know tanked wasn't

01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:39,600
really doing anything other than

01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:41,830
documentation and design type of work

01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,260
over time as we were able to level up

01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:46,750
the team what we saw is I was still

01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:47,980
contributing a pretty good chunk but I

01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:49,750
had other champions that I could work

01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:52,560
with so I was able to identify other

01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:55,840
people who were either inclined excited

01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,270
you know good at it whatever the case

01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,389
may be eventually getting to the point

01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:02,830
where I was no longer the primary

01:12:01,389 --> 01:12:07,320
contributor the team as a whole was

01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:07,320
doing way more than I was in some cases

01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:11,710
it was Joe in this case was doing even

01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,880
more more than I was towards the end he

01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:14,619
was taking full ownership over certain

01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,110
components of modules whereas in the

01:12:14,619 --> 01:12:19,840
beginning he was I think he was a new

01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:22,590
grad straight out of university in in

01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,590
01:12:23,989 --> 01:12:29,270
yeah what we saw not everybody wanted to

01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:30,560
do this and that's okay so this the the

01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:33,020
goal in this particular experiment was

01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,400
yeah decentralizing and while we saw

01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:36,230
some people really start to adopt other

01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,820
people they would try it once twice and

01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:40,160
then you know they're happy to

01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:43,130
contribute PRS you know contribute to

01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:45,790
reviews but not necessarily authoring

01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:45,790
and that's that's okay

01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,660
yes everyone in the team generally

01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:58,910
recognized this is a good good technique

01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:01,160
just not everybody wanted to write or

01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:04,370
was there their mind was not in that

01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:08,150
mode I'll pick on Chuck because I like

01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:09,650
Chuck he he was loving on the DevOps at

01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,630
the time and I was more than happy to

01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:14,690
let him do that right so he was doing

01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:15,739
tons of DevOps kind of work and as a

01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:17,960
result wasn't doing as much

01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:20,000
architectural like design documentation

01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,050
kind of work and that was cool because

01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,210
everybody was doing what they wanted to

01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:25,160
do however we still work closely

01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:28,580
together to kind of have you know the

01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:33,260
team as a whole was really good right we

01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:36,230
were complete as a group so yeah there

01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:38,210
are no detractors I guess what would

01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:42,469
happen if they were a detractor somebody

01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:45,320
who just wasn't down with it I don't

01:13:42,469 --> 01:13:47,180
know that would be it definitely takes

01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,560
time to kind of on board but I don't

01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:54,230
know that I've had anyone like actively

01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:55,340
fight me on on this idea so let's see

01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:58,940
what else we got

01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:01,580
oh yeah I do have this stuff so I can I

01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:06,530
can actually show this so let's keep

01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:10,000
rolling here so how did this actually

01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:13,880
play out across the across the system so

01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,580
here's a breakdown of services so this

01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:18,320
is a micro services environment and on

01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:20,150
the what is that the the column on the

01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,980
side there with the names protected you

01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:24,710
know to protect the change to protect

01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:27,950
the innocent or the guilty whoever they

01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:30,590
are percentage of coke commits to an

01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:32,690
individual service and I guess if I were

01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:35,540
to pose a question who are the likely

01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:37,550
architects for any given service

01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:40,760
who would you point to is the one who

01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:46,730
has kind of the design design Authority

01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:49,120
in that space one doing fewer commits

01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:49,120
okay

01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:53,180
typically we saw it was the opposite

01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:54,350
actually the people doing the most

01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:56,240
commits were the ones with the most

01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:57,710
influence and we kind of you know called

01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,960
them oh those are the the architects of

01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:02,120
that that service I shared these slides

01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:04,910
with a CMU class architecture class once

01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:06,590
and they got out pitch for pitch works

01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:08,030
and we're very upset that I was just

01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:09,950
calling anybody who wanted an architect

01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:12,100
but that's what it is it doesn't you

01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:15,200
know everybody should be an architect so

01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:16,310
you know if you have influence an

01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:21,800
architect should know how to code

01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:30,350
exactly that's right how else am I gonna

01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:31,580
toast my toast in my yeah Gary

01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:36,290
especially I don't know what Gary is up

01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:38,090
to but he's everywhere anyway yeah so so

01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:39,290
these are the people that had you know

01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:40,250
kind of the most influence for each of

01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:42,800
these things what's cool about this

01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:44,570
though is you know we've got everybody

01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,940
everybody involved in different things

01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:49,000
Bullwinkle they're working on our

01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:52,450
service D suzana and a couple of places

01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,530
Barry Larry in a couple places right so

01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:57,500
Yoda I don't know what Yoda is doing

01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:58,550
down there but we can answer some more

01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:00,440
stuff with this too which is kind of

01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:08,840
neat which services might you say have

01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:10,900
poor design integrity yeah I can tell

01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,310
you service F was a dumpster fire

01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:16,190
service bu is not not far behind

01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:17,510
so when there was not we do need some

01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:18,620
Authority is the main lesson from this

01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:20,510
but it doesn't have to be the same

01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:21,830
person we can we can kind of

01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:23,480
decentralize and have different people

01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:24,980
in charge of different things and I

01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,840
think the only reason that worked in

01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:29,120
this particular context was because we

01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:31,010
were using a technique like a TRS to

01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,510
allow people to explore but then also

01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:36,080
bring it back together in a documented

01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:38,180
way so that was pretty cool I'll see

01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:46,910
what else we got here yeah it's just

01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:48,260
more the same kind of stuff so okay why

01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:48,730
don't we just call it there I'm gonna

01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:50,110
put up some

01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:51,989
references and we'll figure out how to

01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:53,800
get these slides out out to folks

01:16:51,989 --> 01:16:57,160
because this isn't good stuff so

01:16:53,800 --> 01:17:00,850
decision records decision logs cool

01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:03,040
since 1997 maybe even sooner earlier

01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:04,600
whatever it is older than that

01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:08,850
there's a lot of really great literature

01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:11,770
on this topic if you're so inclined the

01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:14,140
2005 tiger II and Ackerman paper is

01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:16,530
pretty darn good on this topic if you

01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:18,370
want books architecture practice

01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:19,480
architecture and practice and

01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:23,440
documenting software architectures are

01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:25,750
also solid and I already referenced the

01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,920
the Nygaard talk looks like it was the

01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:29,710
middle of editing this and the band in

01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:33,190
it yeah should have put my book on there

01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:36,489
but whatever lots of papers on recent

01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:37,810
stuff so these are all i mean sharing

01:17:36,489 --> 01:17:39,220
snippets and bits of pieces from a lot

01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:41,140
of these things but there's a handful of

01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:44,110
papers videos stuff like that out there

01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:46,239
and if you're looking for more templates

01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:53,850
and examples where's my mouse

01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:53,850
oh no more tibideaux got code alright

01:17:55,900 --> 01:18:10,210
this stuff if it links come on now okay

01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:12,190
well whatever i like to show you this

01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:20,350
but i'm not able to open these things

01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:22,780
very easily no internet and that's why

01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:26,489
all's good should i connected ahead of

01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:26,489
time what you'll see on those pages are

01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,580
lists of templates different things you

01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,900
can try out different things you can use

01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,760
not just the one template that i showed

01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:36,120
probably six seven eight different types

01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,440
that people have been experimenting with

01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,520
links to even more resources there's a

01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:41,200
lot of case studies out there with this

01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,450
stuff so it's you know pretty pretty

01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,560
wide amount of stuff and then I

01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:49,350
mentioned this fellow here at Ken power

01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:52,150
you can find a video of his on YouTube

01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:56,770
just by following that amazing link

01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:58,420
there I'll get these up online someplace

01:18:56,770 --> 01:19:01,690
for people to be able to find them but

01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:05,060
yeah with that

01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:06,440
so I'm a big subscriber to the silver

01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:08,090
toolbox method so I can't give you a

01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:09,860
silver bullet okay but I can't give you

01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:13,520
a silver toolbox this is one more tool

01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:15,860
for that toolbox hopefully and I do have

01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,150
a book I guess is my minor plug it does

01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:19,760
talk about 80 ARS in there as well

01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:20,750
so you can check that out for some of

01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,929
the things we talked about today for

01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:25,369
even more detail yeah with that I guess

01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:27,409
if there's any questions I'm happy to

01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:31,740
stick around otherwise thank you very

01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:38,390
