sure and the Benjamins nobody said that

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:26,090
once I believe um that was uh Sean Combs

00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,590
Sean puffy combs imagine how different

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:33,469

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:35,120
went with poufiness to the puffy I mean

00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:38,809
his coders we know how important is when

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,670
we named things yeah god Sean puffy

00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:48,460
combs would not have been a successful

00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:51,769
producer now definitely not okay like

00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,359
just like how his entire career would

00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:57,260
have shaped out if every time you said

00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,879

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:37,380
broken human being right now I like my

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,750
entire body is bruised and sore and I'm

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,960
just like I'm struggling to do

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,900
everything so if I trail off in my

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,560
speech it's cuz like my hip is like

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:54,180
terrible but just things happen just as

00:05:49,560 --> 00:06:00,450
a forewarning alright we have one viewer

00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:02,190
which is like huge so I think we can

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:06,660

our guest host because uh lap late last

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:29,870
month he wrote an article called Ruby

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:32,269
isn't dead see how 2014 was the year of

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,640
programming deaths and how things have

00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,950
fallen out of favor including TDD agile

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,110
framework Ruby and we're just going to

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:44,750
talk about those things in general and

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:51,620
um what it means to be coding with style

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:53,390
right now and all that so um okay pj

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,950
wants you out introduce yourself and

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,690
then maybe introduce a little bit about

00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,500
your article on what you're thinking

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:02,300
with it alright so as Justin said I'm

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,730
the community team leader engine yard I

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,370
am the kind of the leader of a team of

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,130
people whose job it is to specifically

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,560
go out into their perspective

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,060
communities in my case that's Ruby we

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,670
have a guy does PHP you guys does

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,350
general open source and we go out we

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,640
reach out and we find out what the

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,800
community needs bring that information

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,390
back to engine yard and also supply the

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,700
community with things they need like you

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:28,540
know information on where things are

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,770
going tracking trends things like that

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,779
the biggest thing that we do is go to

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,300
conferences and speak and Justin that's

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:38,089
where you and I actually met at the the

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:42,290
first steel city was the first time I

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:44,870
spoke publicly you were there and all of

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,230
that long road led to now becoming the

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:52,750
community team lead the article actually

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:57,170
came from the fact that i went to about

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:59,690
twenty conferences in 2014 and i was

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,690
kind of doing my retrospective look back

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,820
at the year so to speak and i was

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,490
looking at how many times there were

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,160
mentions of you know is ruby dead is

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,810
ruby dead is ruby dead let's have a

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,149
panel to discuss where Ruby is going to

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,640
see if it's dead let's do this let's do

00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,589
that and it's just I was kind of

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,670
frustrated because I'm like here's a big

00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,560
vibrant language

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,390
things are going really well it's

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,740
maturing and I would even say it's

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,250
mature to the point where people are

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,140
using it in production for major

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,500
large-scale organizations and their

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,780
applications and yet suddenly the the

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,090
the cool hip kids are like rubies dead

00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,290
can't do anything with Ruby anymore it's

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,650
like you could probably do more with

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:46,430
Ruby than you can when i started with it

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:48,110
six five or six years ago but people

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,300
have decided that maturity equals death

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,120
because it's not the new hotness is your

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,270
second before it's not invoked so I

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,500
decided instead of doing like my usual

00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:01,490
2014 year in review i would write an

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,170
article about Ruby not being dead um and

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,120
it was originally slated to be kind of a

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,190
kind of a toss away because it was

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,660
coming out the day after Christmas who

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,950
was going to read this blog post and it

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,620
ended up being one of the most popular

00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,530
blog posts for all of 2014 on the

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,750
engineered blog so it was kind of it's

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,520
kind of nuts the way it all happened but

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,100
yeah it's just my feeling that you know

00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,600
Ruby still a strong strong language it's

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,090
still important it's still pertinent in

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,950
the community is still huge so let's not

00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,280
you know put nails and coffins that

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:35,720
haven't been built yet yeah absolutely

00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:39,380
eyes I mean I think that you know this

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,410
show's theme is about coding and bug

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,940
because I mean just because it's not

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,450
shiny doesn't mean it's not good anymore

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,090
and that seems to be what the difference

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:53,570
is with Ruby now it's not the shiny new

00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:56,060
thing it's not people leaving PHP for

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,180
Ruby either you know like it used to be

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,450
now it's just okay Ruby's there yes yeah

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,690
now as people are leaving Ruby for go or

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:07,520
ember or angular or God probably there's

00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,920
at least three people that left Ruby for

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,110
swift and I'm sorry for them especially

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,050
when the when the benchmarks came out

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:18,620
recently had Swift is slower than like

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:20,540
what we were using before Swift but yeah

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,270
I think that I think that part of it is

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,790
an attitude of the individual developer

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,950
I think certain developers want to be

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,980
just using the new hot stuff they don't

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,480
want to be tied down to a job where

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,379
they're making software they're really

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,789
focused on

00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:37,129
the academic side and there's nothing

00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:40,369
wrong with that I mean I think it's

00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:44,119
great to explore the deep deep dive that

00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:46,819
deep delving parts of a language to get

00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:48,919
familiar with it and I also support the

00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:50,809
idea of being polyglot but at the same

00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,449
time I think it's the way that we cast

00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:55,970
aside a language that that's pertinent

00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:59,679
here just saying something's offhandedly

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:02,149
dead is not you know conducive to

00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,609
helping a community grow or helping

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:06,739
community sustain and that's really the

00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:08,539
problem that I had with it is is it's

00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:10,879
not dead people are still using it it's

00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:15,679
very active it's just not the newest

00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:18,889
hottest thing anymore yeah I think um

00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:21,319
yeah I think it's it's basically it's

00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,909
been sort of eclipse I like this this

00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:25,159
big like closure has a community that's

00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:26,869
like sort of getting way more traction

00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:32,470
and closures like a nice language but

00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:34,639
it's it's really like it's I kind of um

00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,199
see it as the same thing there was a

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,569
response to your article like is PHP

00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,759
dead or is it just deader than Ruby or

00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:43,579
whatever you're a total per Leah or

00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,379
pearl pearl yeah but like I think about

00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:48,769
it is like the same thing as PHP like no

00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:50,239
but like PHP is still used by a ton of

00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:51,919
people like there's still a ton of

00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:55,729
websites written in PHP and I feel sorry

00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,639
for those guys but um like Ruby is a

00:14:55,729 --> 00:15:00,649
great language like I don't I spend most

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,139
of my days now doing embed and see stuff

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:05,149
but i have like scripts that I right or

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:07,669
in Ruby I have tools that help me with

00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:09,499
my C coding that are written in Ruby and

00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:13,189
Ruby is a great language and it's really

00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:17,119
gotten to a mature point um so I

00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:18,649
definitely agree that um we shouldn't be

00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:21,799
discounting things that are just getting

00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:23,269
old and that's kind of a natural life

00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,299
cycle like I feel like this happens to a

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,829
lot of languages and frameworks like

00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,749
people it reaches a certain level of

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,449
maturity where it's like it's

00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:34,819
legitimized and then shortly afterwards

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:37,279
people like oh well now it's legitimate

00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:40,099
like it's almost like it's the man now

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,720
right like you write being like from

00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:43,069
rebelling against a man to becoming the

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,350
man and that's kind of the same sort of

00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:47,329
life cycle yeah it's like it's like it's

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,829
like the old kids in there

00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:50,779
the record just like hipsters if it's

00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:53,660
like Oh Ruby yeah I did Ruby before it

00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:55,399
was cool yeah yeah yeah would you do

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,170
before that like PHP but that's before

00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,110
is like a major corporate tool you know

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,489
what I'm saying and I actually think

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,980
it's the same thing and you know I've

00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:06,110
been to a bunch of PHP conferences and

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,759
they think the same thing that I'm

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,619
saying right now about Ruby like you

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,559
think HP's still vibrant it's still

00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:15,709
heavily used it's a great tool and I

00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:18,049
think that you know having seeing seeing

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:20,899
what tools work properly for what job is

00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:22,819
really important and part of that is not

00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:24,860
discounting anything so like you know if

00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:27,199
I was to pick up a project and realize

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,449
that the best option for it was PHP i

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,759
would go with PHP i wouldn't have a

00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:33,199
problem with it um it wouldn't be my

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,889
first choice i always try everything in

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,540
Ruby first but you know at the same time

00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:39,799
like you know I'm open to new languages

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,290
but I'm not going to put anything to

00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,029
production in node because I don't think

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,259
it's ready yet and I know it's been

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,509
around for a couple years a lot of

00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:49,699
people like BAM reuse a note everything

00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:51,439
we do is number just because something

00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:53,449
has a dot j/s the end of it doesn't mean

00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:58,009
i think it's the the front end answer to

00:16:53,449 --> 00:17:01,339
all the things if that makes sense then

00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:04,309
uh Cohen spies like a largely polyglot

00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:07,459
organization and we hold events on all

00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:09,639
kinds of languages um but you know at

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:14,019
the end of the day I'm I'm a rubios and

00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:16,130
like what I get out of these events is

00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:20,299
things that help me you'd be better at

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,860
Ruby so I mean you know there's there's

00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:23,750
a there's a part of it where you can

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,000
explore these new languages without

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,250
saying you know the primary thing you

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,730
work with is dead you can you can learn

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,529
a lot from what's going on and it gives

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,590
you this perspective on you know your

00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:38,000
regular tool that I you know you

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,760
wouldn't get if you didn't explore like

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,799
that and you know he doesn't mean

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,230
absolutely any Ruby just to look at

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,840
these new things right now I think

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,210
that's the that you hit the nail on the

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,769
head there you can go to any kind of you

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,200
know and codon supplies a great example

00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:56,179
because it is a polyglot meet up but you

00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,620
know I live in Buffalo New York and here

00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,120
we have kind of separate meetups but

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,770
we've done joint meetups together and

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,810
they've always been really cool

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:04,430
the fact that I Reapers like oh I've

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:07,490
never really thought about doing it like

00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,380
that with the tool that I'm using so let

00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:12,590
me go and stretch the boundaries of the

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,560
tool that I'm using and that in and of

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,940
itself reinvigorates that tool maybe

00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,890
just for yourself or maybe you're

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,750
actually contributing back to the to the

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,370
open source core of it and you're

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,640
actually expanding the ability of that

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:29,030
tool whether it be Ruby or PHP or you

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,350
know pearl or whatever Python you know

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,640
you're getting it to another level

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,320
because you like oh I didn't realize I

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,750
could do this now that I know that I can

00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,370
i found a monkey patch or a workaround

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,260
or something else now i'm going to

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,030
submit a pull request and i'm going to

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,100
make it better for everyone that's what

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,980
keeps these languages organic and alive

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,080
all of them and one of the trends right

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,890
now that i think is pretty popular is

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,620
functional programming and I've learned

00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,820
so much from that and I like

00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,040
functionally programming in Ruby just

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,040
using those concepts and bring them back

00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,630
home just because it's not a functional

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,640
language doesn't mean you can't use some

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,950
of the concepts of you know black box

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,620
programming and all that and bullying

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:14,990
that's not built that way so absolutely

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:18,710
yeah exploring is great um like and I

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:21,350
made Ruby isn't that may be right well I

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,820
and I mean if you think about it it's

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:27,620
not just the language itself it's also

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:30,350
the concepts Ruby when it hit and I mean

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,550
especially with rails which I freely

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,350
admit I'm not a huge fan of rails

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,790
anymore because I don't build projects

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,450
that need that kind of overhead they're

00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:40,040
not that large but even when you know

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,380
when when rails came about Ruby really

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,790
became a huge thing people started to

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,620
understand the idea of gems you got

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,720
things like our vm and bundler for

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,520
version management and package

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,770
management now you're looking back at

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,020
all these languages and and PHP was like

00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,330
you know we don't like Ruby your stole

00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,160
our all our developers a long long time

00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,480
ago and now they're like you know hey

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,010
we've got composer and composers like

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,680
bundler you know we've got these

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,930
frameworks they're using MVC kind of

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,850
like rails and I mean and rails didn't

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,250
come up with the idea of MVC that wasn't

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,020
new the concepts of functional

00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,090
programming they're not new they're just

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,330
being seeing new life by people that are

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,340
bring

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,190
back and applying them to things like

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,640
Ruby that weren't using them before um

00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:25,039
Jessica Kerr actually gave a group gives

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,049
a great talk about how Ruby is not but

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,419
can be a functional programming language

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:31,850
and if anybody's into functional

00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:33,470
programming and into Ruby go look it up

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,590
i think it's on con freaks it's just an

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,630
amazing talk yeah we can will include a

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:42,730
link in the show notes to to that will

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:46,519
find it and include a link cool yeah um

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,409
so you talked about NBC and like the

00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:49,669
things that good things that rails kind

00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:53,149
of brings to the table things that

00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:55,010
people get taught about and a lot of

00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:59,149
people in the Ruby and rails community

00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:02,029
are into TDD but then you know someone

00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:05,480
like ehh the founder or the crater

00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:09,169
brails comes out says TDD is dead so uh

00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,690
I mean what do you think of other things

00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:18,049
that are losing favor in different ways

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:19,370
um I think that I think that often david

00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:25,190
says things that make wonderful

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:26,899
headlines um yeah like and I you know I

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:30,350
saw the talk I didn't see it live but I

00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:32,750
saw the talk and I think it was amazing

00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,809
if you really dig deep down between the

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:39,289
giant headline of TDD is dead and olive

00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:41,210
can I swear on this show sure we allowed

00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:43,789
all of the all of the and bull

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,320
shits and swearing that he does and if

00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:47,539
you look at what he was really saying is

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,200
that you can't base your whole life on

00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:52,429
TDD yeah because I mean I think we were

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,159
reaching a point where TDD was

00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:57,110
practically a religion you know people

00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,690
like comment you must write test you

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,279
must have X percentage of coverage and

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,679
if you don't then I cannot associate

00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,600
with you it's orrible and I think that's

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,049
kind of what he was addressing the

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,179
delivery not have been the best but I

00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:13,399
mean I think we all agree testing is

00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,990
super important testing is a must-have

00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:18,710
for any project that involves more than

00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,720
one person that has any kind of lasting

00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,880
tenacity that's going to last more than

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,649
you know five minutes or some sort of

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,280
you know proof of concept you have to

00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:30,260
have testing but at the same time like

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,480
shouldn't be like you know we're going

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,430
to focus just on testing and the rest of

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,730
the app be damned as long as we have you

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:40,840
know 87 lines to our three line method

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,550
is 87 lines of testing then we're great

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,460
yeah and not analyzing the fact that

00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:50,600
maybe we're over testing yeah I think

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,590
that's what he meant by it but i think

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,360
you know again there's there's other

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,130
opps i think when you have a large

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,320
project you're working for a consultancy

00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:59,180
or company and you have a product you're

00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,430
trying to produce you need to have a

00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:04,640
little bit of TDD you have to have a

00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,780
little bit of BDD you have to have a

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,420
little bit of what my friend Bill

00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,830
Chapman calls STD which is shame driven

00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,050
development which is the idea of writing

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,730
just enough tests so the next person

00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,470
comes along know you knows you did it

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,970
but you don't have to like you know

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,820
embarrass yourself by pointing out the

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,080
fact you're not great at writing tests

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,750
may have a lot of conversations of a

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,210
different different philosophies on what

00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:29,570
drives the development it can't be one

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:31,250
thing I mean it's it it's as simple it's

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,980
a simple concept going back to you know

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,300
don't put all your eggs in one basket

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,690
make sure you can diversify the way you

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,650
do things because I know I don't want to

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,930
jump the guy no we're going to get to

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,370
add jail too but you know it's kind of

00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,050
the same idea of you know if you only

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,240
move things in one direction you're not

00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,940
actually flexible you're not actually

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,730
able to deal with emergencies when they

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,170
come up so I mean if I worked at a shop

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:58,100
before I worked at Engine Yard where we

00:23:54,170 --> 00:24:00,770
made educational software and it was we

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,590
moved to Ruby just as TDD was becoming

00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,820
like a huge thing again and one of the

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,470
guys our team was like we gotta write

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,910
test the boss Mike Dryden goes if I

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,460
catch any of you writing tests you're

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,780
all fired we don't have time for this

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,670
you have three months to rewrite an

00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:18,020
entire product that was written visual

00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:21,050
foxpro make it happen um so tests became

00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,670
not an important thing that product

00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,870
still exists so I won't say what it was

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,910
called or the name of the company or

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,290
anything but if any of my friends who

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,060
work there are listening they're

00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,350
probably laughing right now because I

00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:34,670
don't think any tests were ever written

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:36,170
for it um yeah and but it's that kind of

00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:39,920
bad situation where someone comes in and

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:42,100
says hey you don't have time to write

00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,150
tests we need to fix this now

00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,190
and that's where you get you know your

00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,800
monkey patching and your macgyvering of

00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,210
code and stuff like that to make it work

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,530
and then you'll worry about maybe you'll

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,110
worry about refactoring it and doing it

00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,880
the right way later but the concept of

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,970
TDD doesn't let you do that it's very

00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,730
inflexible I think that's really where

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,110
what David wanted to say I'm not a

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:06,800
hundred percent sure I don't know the

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:09,020
man that closely but at the same time I

00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,360
think that sometimes he gets up on stage

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:15,110
and he says hmm what is the most

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,790
incendiary thing I said you know like

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,500
what's he gonna say this year rails cop

00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:25,640
is like hey welcome everyone you know

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:27,230
what gems hate him um I think he's

00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,870
running out of things to say that burned

00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,520
down the house yeah I so I got the same

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,080
thing like I saw the headline I read

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,790
like I watched the talk later I read the

00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,170
thing and I had basically the same

00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,390
conversation with a buddy at work and I

00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,450
said like it was really interesting to

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:45,410
me how that talk generated so much furor

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:47,150
online and I was like if you just read

00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:51,020
when he said like nothing that he said

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:52,790
was like was really like bad he was just

00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,490
saying like be practical about how

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,020
you're testing like you know don't spend

00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,300
all this time writing this test the test

00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,530
is some weird really random edge case

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,530
that you're never going to encounter

00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:05,930
again because like that's a waste of

00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:09,020
your money in your resources mm-hmm but

00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:10,940
people took it as like oh no he's look

00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,920
at what dhh said which is basically how

00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,440
I view every single talk that he ever

00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,600
gives its like the subject matter is not

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,670
merely a sensationalist as everybody

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,380
makes it out to be and like what he's

00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,420
saying is really practical or really

00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,550
like it's metered but it's like

00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,260
punctuated with right it's like

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,980
and this that this is dead

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,930
that's dead we shouldn't do that yeah it

00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:35,930
exactly I think I you know what it gets

00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:38,660
I hate to say it but it gets people to

00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,130
buy tickets to railsconf yeah just for

00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,140
the keynote so they can see what the

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:45,520
hell he's going to say I feel like it's

00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:48,020
a it's the one like even at rubyconf

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,570
which I have a little bit of experience

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,240
keynoting like maybe not everyone shows

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,430
up at every keynote but damn it when

00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,630
when he gets takes to stage

00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:58,760
everyone who's at that conference is in

00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,470
that room because they're like what's he

00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,390
gonna say we're gonna go with

00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,790
coffeescript oh my god coffeescript what

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,590
is that why are we doing this and it

00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,600
doesn't matter what like I sorted out

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,600
here you have to know I really enjoy

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,390
lamb chops here's a crazy masochist who

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,300
hates lambs like doesn't matter what he

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:21,020
says it's it's gonna be sold and

00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:23,720
marketed as this man's insane and he

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,960
should probably burnt at the stake so

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,930
maybe we haven't missed if I host the

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,470
time yeah so maybe we have a

00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:35,630
misunderstanding about d teaches a

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:38,600
subject through through his delivery and

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:41,870
maybe he's saying tdd isn't that Dogma

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,880
is dead and it should be dead I think

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:46,840
that's really woody yeah yeah I think

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:50,180
that's really what he's getting out um

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:54,470
and I that leads kind of right into our

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:59,720
you know our next dead our next uh grave

00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:02,870
stone uh agile Dave Thomas wrote an

00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,300
article uh that he felt that uh agile

00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:08,210
was dead because it had been taken over

00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,850
from its original intention of what they

00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:13,240
came up with when they met for the first

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:18,670
time to write the agile manifesto and I

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:22,090
I see like it's a different type of uh

00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:25,010
this is like almost kind of like the

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,530
thing with Ruby earlier when the man has

00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,730
taken it over but it's a little

00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,980
different because it's also been

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:35,510
co-opted a little in a way that they

00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,980
didn't intend originally so that's just

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:42,020
another way that something could die I

00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,580
feel yeah I definitely think that we're

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,650
as we were saying the Ruby isn't dead

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:49,310
because it's evolved into a mature and

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:51,950
and more stable thing agile has actually

00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:55,880
kind of devolved into being a hell of a

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:58,070
lot like waterfall like you'll get all

00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,130
the terminology surrounding agile like

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:04,580
you know scrums and teams and sprints

00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:06,880
and you know all this kind of framing

00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,909
around it but what you actually get is a

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,979
very inflexible

00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:13,440
team working to the deadline of someone

00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:15,359
who's not on that team I've seen it

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,950
again several different organizations

00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,889
that I've been directly or indirectly

00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:22,559
involved in where they say oh we're so

00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:25,679
agile you see that's great we need to

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,779
make this change right now um this new

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,509
version of X just came out and we need

00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:32,460
to add it to the stack great um we'll

00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:35,129
put that in a two or three Sprint's from

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,979
now it's like you realize how inflexible

00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:41,489
you're being what is the word agile mean

00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:43,470
it means flexible that's kind of the

00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:46,019
idea behind agile and I think that's why

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,999
dave was again saying like it went up

00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,830
like a great thing everyone can do what

00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:51,570
needs to be done we can get the main

00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,690
work done we can be flexible enough to

00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:56,909
get the emergency work done and still

00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,529
continue moving forward and now it's

00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:01,759
more like no we will move in this

00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:07,710
direction do not veer from that pass

00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:11,340
which is definitely not agile so maybe

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:14,279
you know people they wanted to be a part

00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:18,779
of something cool something stylish like

00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:21,269
agile they took it to an extreme and

00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:23,789
then that caused that original thing to

00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:25,889
just not work anymore it's you know when

00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:28,440
you add you know these certifications

00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:30,389
and everything you can to something

00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,539
that's cool and then that's you know

00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:37,320
when it becomes uncool that's not in

00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:41,279
styling but it's kind of like going back

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:43,559
to like late 90s early 2000s like what

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:48,029
was the what was it you guys might be

00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:49,950
too young for this is my old man um what

00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:53,099
the most important thing you could do in

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:57,869
your IT related career was get an mcse

00:30:53,099 --> 00:31:00,210
certification wow man which uh yeah is

00:30:57,869 --> 00:31:03,720
the microsoft certification so that you

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:07,739
could use like why i asked like it was

00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,139
like just absolutely it was difficult to

00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:11,970
get you had to take courses and like

00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:14,220
people worked really hard but this is

00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,109
like your badge of honor and now people

00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,200
do the same way like men I have agile

00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:21,389
certification it's like what does that

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,739
even mean

00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:24,119
you have a piece of paper that says you

00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:26,849
took a course it says you understand a

00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:33,599
July and you can be a scrum master

00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:36,359
that's amazing it's kind of it is kind

00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:40,320
of like a applying of that old mcse idea

00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:43,320
to modern tech culture and modern work

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,559
culture of oh this piece of paper means

00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,329
something but um I like to whenever

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,509
people talk about certification so if I

00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:52,950
always like to look back on like I have

00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,929
a degree I of four year degree I went to

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,249
school again I'm older like that's what

00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:00,779
you were supposed to do so that's what

00:31:56,249 --> 00:32:03,419
you did but nowadays like I see a lot of

00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:05,309
programmers that are coming from boot

00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:07,589
camps or just doing it themselves and

00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:10,320
they're absolutely stunningly amazing

00:32:07,589 --> 00:32:12,529
and no one thinks to ask oh did you go

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,849
to college do you do have a CS degree

00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:16,739
because that's important it's actually

00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,450
not that important and in the same way

00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:19,829
like there's people that can apply agile

00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,629
methodologies that understand the

00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:23,999
concepts that don't have a piece of

00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:25,349
paper saying that they do and there's

00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:26,459
others another piece of paper they might

00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:29,940
have been the bottom of the class we

00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:36,029
don't know it doesn't matter um I think

00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:38,429
you know I daves take on what agile

00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:40,739
could be and why maybe it's dad is again

00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:42,299
kind of the idea there's an evolution in

00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:45,329
the workforce as evolution in the way

00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:46,619
people do things and agile could have

00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:47,940
been one of the things that evolved with

00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:51,179
it but it looks like it's going in the

00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,659
other direction let's go back to the

00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,099
corporate I mean huh have either of you

00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:00,079
ever gone to a conference and had to

00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:02,549
wear a dress shirt and khaki pants now

00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,879
now would you want to go back to that

00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:07,559
I've had to do that I've had to do that

00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:09,269
and I would never want to ever go back

00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,429
to that like I'm a t-shirt and jeans

00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:13,109
kind of guy i'm pretty sure that when i

00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:16,769
died that's what i'll be buried in a fan

00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:18,299
in my hat um like I don't want to go

00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:21,419
back to the whole like I have to wear a

00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:24,269
suit code thing and I think that agile

00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:27,299
is going back to that you know corporate

00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:28,349
cubicle attitude of that you used to

00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,389
seeing waterfall when they adopted

00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:31,709
waterfall and I'm sure that when

00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:34,770
waterfall came out people like this is

00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:37,260
great amazing methodology

00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,420
and eventually every was like this sucks

00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:43,950
it's just owned by the man and need to

00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:47,790
move on is it going to be a cyclical

00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:50,640
thing where you know that like the MSC

00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:52,800
or venue and now the scrum

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,210
certifications do you think whatever is

00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,980
next you think this is just a natural

00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:59,460
cycle that is just going to keep

00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,980
happening over and over again or I would

00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,840
I would think so I mean even you know

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,390
going back to the languages in TDD I

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,300
think everything you know in tech kind

00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:11,730
of moves in cycles I mean if you look at

00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,880
it let's look at rails for example rails

00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,890
is built in MVC and for quite a few

00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,330
years before the NBC was like and maybe

00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:20,340
this isn't such a great thing I mean it

00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,720
came round like the 70s and 80s and it

00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,790
was the biggest most important thing in

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,270
the world and it took a big dip and then

00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:29,130
didn't come back around like you know

00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,740
2002 2003 and that's what Bill trails

00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:33,210
out and it's kind of like ho so here's

00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,890
an old concept that's being new cam

00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,470
functional programming is another great

00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:39,840
example old concept kind of abandoned

00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:42,899
thought is being dinosaur now making a

00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,360
huge resurgence I think agile and and

00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:48,419
similar philosophies are are also in a

00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:51,679
kind of cycle where there's kind of like

00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:55,169
you know creation acceptance adoption

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,390
corporation and then we go on the down

00:34:55,169 --> 00:34:58,860
certain till we come back and I don't

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,420
maybe it'll come back a different form

00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,210
of agile maybe it'll come back under a

00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,180
different name but the concept itself

00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,770
will come back I think there will be a

00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:11,850
cycle and I think there isn't a lot of

00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:14,100
things that we do in dec that so

00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,020
cyclical chart nature was pretty

00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:20,130
beautiful i think that that deserves to

00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,450
be drawn up by somebody saw her yeah not

00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,070
me did the best i could do is with my

00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:25,560
finger if i picked up a pen that would

00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:29,280
be maybe football-shaped might be

00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:33,240
slightly deflated that says for another

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:38,210
podcast yeah try drawing with pj that's

00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,210
the other drawing with how not to draw

00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,600
and you talk about NBC and uh the first

00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:48,000
time you said NBC uh in this podcast i

00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,690
popped up in a new tab and i searched

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,599
for

00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:55,710
DC is dead and of course I found

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,599
something of course you did um and it's

00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,690
written by a Conrad are when he's a

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:06,390
really great guy Conrad everyone is the

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:11,060
founder credit pry right um but it's

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:22,560
lost all sound for some reason oh dear

00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:38,339
did you hit the mute button we can still

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:43,440
hear you or can we now unmute now

00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:46,319
alright i unmuted ok we can hear you can

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,430
you hear us I can hear you if i unplug

00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:54,119
my headphones let's try now uh one ok

00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:57,329
alright sweet like an hour Alec yeah

00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:00,920
there we go ok here just alright alright

00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:04,170
so NBC's and yeah and he sees that uh

00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:07,319
and it's like you give you you could

00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:10,980
create a podcast with a once a week

00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:13,560
episode on what's dead this week but I'm

00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,750
sorry I interrupted go ahead but I mean

00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,329
you know I just wanted I just you know

00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,829
thought to google it um and of course

00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:22,170
you know there's something out there and

00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:23,579
it's by Conrad everyone who's you know

00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,150
someone that I really respect in

00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:28,980
communities you wrote cry and he's a vp

00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:31,290
of engineering a bug snag so it's not

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,880
just like someone saying this and of

00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,829
course right I didn't have time to read

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,569
the article during the time that I

00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:38,160
popped open the tab to see what he's

00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:40,710
actually saying but you know it's just

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,119
kind of a proof of concept it you know

00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,300
there's always going to be something

00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,849
that's dead and just will always be able

00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,800
to find the next thing that's dead oh

00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:51,950
absolutely and I mean going going back

00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,180
to my article i thought the funniest

00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,369
response was that person who and i know

00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:59,010
we have the link in there who said is

00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:01,400
pearl dead well not as dead as ruby and

00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,400
it was like

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,670
I don't like this is somet it became so

00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:09,300
meta I didn't even understand what I was

00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:12,540
reading anymore um but yeah I mean I

00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:16,260
feel like any time someone with

00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:20,099
authority says Oh some ex is dead ex is

00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:22,410
dead long live x um I think a lot of

00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:24,000
time you know going back to the DHH TD

00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:27,480
is dead thing a lot of times it's the

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,069
headline not so much the news and I

00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,349
think a lot of people believe that you

00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:34,140
know yes things things will change but

00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:35,910
evolution doesn't equal death you know

00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,520
just because things change doesn't mean

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:41,099
a thing won't survive that change and

00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,410
become new and different and rise from

00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:46,109
the ashes so to speak and be an amazing

00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:48,510
thing still as soon as someone learns to

00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:51,480
use it in a different way maybe the

00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:53,579
problem is we get stuck in ruts and we

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,410
get so focused on things like like you

00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:57,240
know what David was saying about TDD

00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:58,859
we're so focused on it that we don't

00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,510
realize the other possibilities or other

00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:05,099
ways you can take it other things you

00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:07,890
can do with it and therefore we were

00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:10,040
like this is that it's so like it's so

00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,730
not sexy it's so not exciting anymore

00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,490
like I don't even want to do this

00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:16,200
anymore so I'm gonna go do

00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,300
behavior-driven development and go

00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:22,740
because that's what's exciting right now

00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:25,349
I want to compile my my code again which

00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,240
again is cyclical I used to compile code

00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:29,250
and now people are doing garlic when

00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,099
compiling code is so cool and like yeah

00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:35,510
I remember when we used to do that when

00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:39,660
I was in like high school it was amazing

00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:42,150
um it all reminds me of portlandia

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,170
whenever the guy just said everything

00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:48,839
was over and just everything is that and

00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:53,010
I'm doing just finger man yeah and I

00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:55,410
just see like even um like the new

00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:57,630
things the cool things like Java

00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:59,579
JavaScript frameworks I see people that

00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:02,400
are already declaring them dead and it's

00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:05,730
like okay note is so totally dead right

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,190
now I think I'm gonna become that guy

00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:10,980
that any new technology that comes out

00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,900
I'm just going to declare it dead you

00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,220
know I think at the three of the three

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,900
of us right now we should

00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,140
we should just create somebody buy the

00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,250
domain name like hipster tech dot io or

00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,920
something like that and we'll just have

00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:26,580
a weekly article about what's dead I'm

00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,869
done with it or we can do is dead i oh

00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:33,390
and we go sub domains that have note is

00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:37,130
that that I oh and you know B is that

00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:39,180
yeah yeah yeah I like this idea so

00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:40,890
actually it's like a dynamic scope

00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,590
domain and anything you type there we'll

00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:47,820
just put up we just have a feeling

00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:50,280
better like like the internet is dead i

00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,630
oh yes it's just like every it doesn't

00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,840
matter what you type in any subdomain

00:40:51,630 --> 00:41:00,960
just comes up with a big yes um written

00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:03,840
completely in static HTML three you know

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:08,010
so i logged in to hover and is dead i 0

00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:09,630
is fifty dollars oh alright well you

00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:14,550
guys have sponsorship I just you know I

00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:16,190
just think Chad that might be a thing

00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:19,790
that our lovely sponsored applicable

00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:21,900
hope you putting plans what do you like

00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,490
definitely our listeners should check

00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,810
out deep local they would like some of

00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,369
their projects are really really cool

00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:29,010
like I has anybody seen the like belt

00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:31,890
you guys seen this no it's their

00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,890
Facebook light light like it's like an

00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:36,480
Arduino or something like strapped to a

00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:38,490
like a belt and basically you go up to

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,290
these NFC tags and basically like dry

00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:44,160
hump the tag and it likes the thing on

00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:47,030
facebook this that is a little way if

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,320
that is maybe strange especially if like

00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:53,700
someone wanted like something I said on

00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:57,060
facebook ID personal space do this in

00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:59,490
public places I mean if there's a video

00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,510
if the video is hilarious it's it's

00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:03,900
great how many people have been arrested

00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:05,609
for this I think they only made the one

00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,369
so I think they it was just like an

00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:10,410
internal thing they did but they've done

00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,570
some cool stuff we'll have to put that

00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:17,820
in the show links I googled it it looks

00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:20,820
a disturbing yet yeah I want to like it

00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:24,330
but I'm also afraid I'll never like

00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:26,900
anything again who knows what's been

00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,900
liked by that

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,120
did you know where your liking things

00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:34,440
these days Oh if you have that mental

00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,760
image every time you go to click the

00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,250
like button your yeah you're probably

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,180
gonna like fewer things on jay-z yeah

00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:44,310
really kind of think about what you like

00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,380
yeah because if it weren't for my mom

00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:49,560
and grandma I probably wouldn't even be

00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,840
on facebook at this point but uh yeah

00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:55,740
I'm speaking eating of things being dead

00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,420
um like serious seriously i was sitting

00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,360
my kids were on Christmas vacation

00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,580
holiday vacation a few weeks ago and so

00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,750
there you know my dining room in my

00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,940
living room are pretty much the same

00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,920
room as one long room my wife and I are

00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,690
sitting there and she's like how did you

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,910
see what so-and-so said on facebook and

00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,560
just here Katie and Ian in the in the

00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:18,180
living room they're playing dokapon

00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:20,760
kingdom or something and just says or no

00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:24,030
I'm sorry was Kate she goes do people

00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,490
still use Facebook oh you just looks

00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:29,790
that are dead serious you know she's 12

00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:31,370
he's well she's 13 today but she's 12

00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:34,160
he's 14 he just looks at her and goes

00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:38,250
yeah people like mom and dad's age

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:43,710
that's like wow Facebook you had a good

00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:46,260
10-year run but you're done now um yeah

00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:47,460
well that so then of course it started

00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,190
Scott conferencing what do kids use

00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:53,040
these days they use Instagram and how do

00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:54,540
you think about it Instagram is exactly

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,130
what facebook was when we all start on

00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:59,250
Facebook it is a status and some

00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:01,350
pictures yeah and it's simple to let's

00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,510
um I actually stopped what I'm still on

00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,250
facebook but I don't like check it very

00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,140
often I'm like i'm on twitter and

00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,960
instagram like almost exclusively that's

00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:12,240
where i talk to all my friends and like

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,480
yeah yeah exactly i mean actually that's

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,640
i got my job at engineer my initial job

00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,700
in support when I started there three

00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,730
and a half years ago from a tweet that I

00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:25,950
responded to and sign an email and and

00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:27,930
that one thing led to know like and I

00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:32,130
feel like that's not an uncommon story

00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:34,560
now if i was to say to say you know my

00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,380
parents or my grandparents like hey so

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,580
let's say you randomly see something on

00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,960
the street and you pick up the

00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,070
and call someone sudden you have a job

00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,420
what are the chances that happen they'd

00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:45,090
be like that's not that's not something

00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,980
that happens it's essentially the exact

00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:49,380
same thing I I started talking to a

00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:52,950
stranger from that I've had a job for

00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,240
three and a half years and that's just

00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,880
not the way things were done back then

00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:01,050
and we're probably behind the curve um

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,690
you know I bet you kidding me and they

00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:05,790
probably even think Twitter is dead and

00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:11,670
now it's all about snapchats and geeky

00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:14,450
acts and yeah yeah so I mean just

00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:16,680
another cycle another deathly say it is

00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:19,800
it is I mean because if you think about

00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:23,280
it like yo Jack and even snapchat to

00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:26,040
degree and um let's see low they used to

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,440
love kick in Ovoo like and what are

00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,360
these things but essentially the AOL

00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:35,550
chatrooms that we all used when we were

00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:37,620
kids hell of a lot safer because you can

00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,780
only talk to certain people but you know

00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,280
essentially it they're doing group chat

00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,970
that's what they're doing and that's you

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,430
know a private AOL chat room that's IRC

00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:48,960
yeah you know and this this kind of

00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:50,820
feeds into that to like everybody went

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,860
crazy with it was slack came out slack

00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,120
HQ came out on those oh my god slack

00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,240
he's crazy you could talk to all these

00:45:54,120 --> 00:46:02,520
different good it's basically IRC yeah

00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:06,420
its glare Cyrus and risen yeah that's so

00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:10,560
this might be like a really fascinating

00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:13,680
way to wrap up the show is um is that

00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:17,010
the concept isn't dead the it's not at

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,530
all just the face is dead and it's in it

00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:23,040
I think that's the that's the key and

00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:27,950
like we keep going back to what we love

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:31,200
and it it's ever it's it's uh it's

00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:34,980
immortal IRC is immortal is the half

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:43,260
today oh no I think it do rebranded the

00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:45,530
title I I mean I think that we see that

00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:48,930
there's cycles to everything that things

00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:50,730
go away and they die and but you know in

00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,080
the end we come back to the same ideas

00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,620
and it's just

00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:58,650
a rebranded version of the same idea

00:46:54,620 --> 00:47:00,180
even with languages languages are so

00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:03,960
similar to each other even 20 years

00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:06,900
apart in creation small things change

00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:10,880
but you know the concepts are still the

00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,880
same and would keep coming back um

00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:20,340
that's I feel like that's all it's a

00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:24,300
great ending to the show this is

00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:26,460
beautiful yeah yeah yeah I mean we try

00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,930
something we take the best parts of its

00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,640
if timeout and then it comes back as

00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,160
something new but it's really very

00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,170
similar to the same and that's that's

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,060
how that's basically I'm sure at some

00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:37,650
point this is we reach the singularity

00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:41,220
that's when all of these things will

00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:44,400
have their perfect form yeah yes but

00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:47,720
that's for another show yeah that's four

00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:52,320
that's four is dead do the same

00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:58,380
singularity is dead I oh no it's the

00:47:52,320 --> 00:48:02,040
