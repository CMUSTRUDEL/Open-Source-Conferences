all right hello everybody and welcome to

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,550
the code and supply podcast today we're

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,679
going to be talking with Laura shank web

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,759
designer from New York Laura do you want

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,680
to give yourself a little bit of an

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,359
introduction oh yeah sure so I am I like

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,609
you set out a web designer in New York

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,699
but New few different things so I work

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,189
for myself and I do a lot of some cool

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,599
some client work a lot of custom

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,340
wordpress website so it's small

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,560
businesses but doing that for a while

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,219
but more recently I focuses on teaching

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,170
and so I teach a class it's like coding

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,239
for designers ACT prep which is at the

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,000
Zion school in the city and then I also

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,860
do some corporate training with another

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
company called decoded and so that's

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,640
like training for non-technical

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,770
professionals they call it digital

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,539
enlightenment Sun speak so a lot of

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,660
focus on it as well as my own practice

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,430
of building WordPress sites also kinda

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,460
helping people learn how to code and

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,469
make their own websites so not so much

00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,420
into the coding boot camp but more

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,040
individuals that don't necessarily want

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,720
a career change from one some practical

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,369
skills all right um and I'm I've got to

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,950
choose myself but I'm Alex you know I

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,659
regular host and I'm joined wit by

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,220
Justin reefs are other one of our other

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:23,759
regular hosts Justin hi uh hi everyone

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:28,439
I'm here again uh I guess that's all

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:31,049
good salable so why don't we just start

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,509
I guess we can sort of start Laura how

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,490
did you get started in the whole web

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:39,119
design industry and like what was that

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,549
like as you're getting started yeah sure

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,159
so I really have a fine arts degree

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,960
which is not that uncommon they're going

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,780
to meet a lot of tech people with fine

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,399
arts backgrounds but I went to this I

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,430
started out school at the University of

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,369
Colorado I did hurt making and then had

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,930
my second year in or so I wanted to take

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:02,130
the kind of work I was doing in turn

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,439
into a game video game so cool like a

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,869
polar this who is full set up they kind

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,729
of make you go through a bunch of

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,160
foundation stuff if you want to switch

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,110
mediums so I went to this school in

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,850
Boston

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,850
call the school the museum of fine arts

00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,410
of a very strange and this ridiculously

00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,170
open curriculum but I got started

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,930
teaching myself to do flash games and

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,550
action actions for and then one of my

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,190
teachers was like you should learn how

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:31,010
to make websites too and then you can

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,320
freelance like color around shots which

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,680
is not that easy at all but not what I

00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,209
ended up doing and I did a little

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,730
internship thing with him where I

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:44,450
rebuilt a wordpress theme until the tide

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:46,580
on to the wordpress world as well no

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,380
cool cool I'm here actually so you're

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,760
also you said you're doing a lot of a

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,440
lot of teaching you're helping people

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,989
like sort of learn some practical skills

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,489
that's really interesting cuz it's also

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,350
like one of the goals of code and

00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,270
supplies that we try to do a lot of like

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,130
teaching and just sort of like bringing

00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,030
people up to speed um it's kind of more

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,870
in the boot camp space where we have

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,570
Justin author correct me on the names

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:12,550
code school Saturdays or something like

00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:15,709
that that that's not even remotely close

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,590
it's called starter series starter

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:20,570
series yet I just like how far you off

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,150
you where I was in China rising too hard

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,209
and what is it not it's fine humorous to

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,739
me hey so I guess um it's really

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:30,049
interesting to me like especially with

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,320
the whole dynamic these days and

00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:35,209
everybody's sort of talking about how um

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:41,269
you know everybody needs to learn how to

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:42,739
code is that is that kind of do you see

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,910
that as fueling the people that come to

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,350
you and say hey can you teach me how to

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,850
build this website and teach me how to

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,370
like do some of these things on my own

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:53,570
you see that is like a fuel for that or

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:56,390
is it something else entirely so I kind

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,980
of this is maybe not the right since a

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,739
year but I can't feel like that's a

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,290
little bit Cena building vs that

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,120
everybody needs to know how to code like

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,370
I think you need to understand what code

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,530
is and understand what it does and

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,120
understand that you know you when you're

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,220
building website you can so just like

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,010
move this from up here to down here like

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,350
that might take a week um so I think

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,270
that kind of understanding is pretty

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,820
essential and great but not everybody

00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:25,180
needs to be any practicing developer or

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,220
even able to write a code

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,229
you can appreciate what a developer does

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,880
and that's what this company I was

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,400
mentioning decoded that does they do

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,949
this code in a day workshop for like big

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,380
companies non technical teams till

00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:40,419
you'll work with like a crÃ¨me like a

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,280
marketing team or people that just

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,070
interface with developers somehow but

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,720
have no need to code themselves but just

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,509
giving them that literacy is really

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,250
important so I guess with the kind of

00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,240
people that come to me that kind of

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,210
people I want to work with a lot of

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,669
times our will that want to work with a

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,930
developer and they want a website and

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,580
they want to understand what's involved

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,190
in that and how what they're paying for

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,199
because you know website can cost five

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,870
hundred dollars it could cost several

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,560
million dollars so understanding where

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,090
that discrepancy happens and teaching

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,729
people to make their own websites if

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,680
they want to and also I'm you know some

00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,090
people like designers for sure you might

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,830
want to integrate song will kind of like

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,360
coding skills into their practice or

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,590
like build their own portfolio sites

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:30,430
like that I think I'm kind of on board

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:34,630
with you uh it used I think we're part

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:38,440
of a of a growing reaction to this

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:41,860
everyone needs to code movement and it's

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,960
it's only shown up I think it's only

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,690
been showing up in the past like two

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,970
months or so that people are finally

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:52,960
reacting against it in a negative way

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:56,259
where it's fine if it's great to make

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,720
available the resources to code to

00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:01,599
anyone that wants to but there's people

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,440
out there like I think the quote I think

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:08,680
will.i.am said this of all people that

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,240
coding is the new literacy and everyone

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,750
needs to companies to be able to code

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,330
and I I think that a lot of people are

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,789
kind of pushing back on that I've seen

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,810
other people on Twitter to have that

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:24,880
same sentiment and I think it's finally

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,280
reached this point where we're kind of

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,030
fed up with this idea that we need to

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,219
teach two-year-olds to code because it's

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,870
it's a it's a real hard thing to do it's

00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:36,669
we don't we don't say that a

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,880
two-year-old needs to be able to build a

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:42,880
house or something like that

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,550
so I I'm with you and I see what you

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,480
mean by like not everyone needs to code

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,850
I I really think that the the real

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,920
statement is that we need to make

00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,280
resources available to people that want

00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,360
to and some people really you know want

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:05,260
to and at least understand that is great

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,440
yes I think okay huh like the first

00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,820
problem with that statement is that

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,650
coding like when you submit I'm

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,020
depending on home talking to oil

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,440
hesitate to say I know how I break code

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:21,430
all day but I'm not a major girl code to

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,200
your engineer um I don't write like back

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,030
in some things like I spent a lot of

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,800
time in HTML and CSS a little bit of

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,690
JavaScript exafs that kind of stuff

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,980
which is a lot of programming concepts

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,120
that are part of that but like baby of

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,400
coding it's a broad spectrum of

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,650
understanding as well and so pulling

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,730
back to teaching two-year-olds how to

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,170
code or that kind of thing I think

00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:46,960
that's um way essential that people get

00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:50,830
there the gay an understanding of what

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,260
it does but then like I work with pretty

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:56,110
much exclusively adults and so that kind

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,660
of thing if somebody puts in their 50s

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,430
and wants to change jobs and they're

00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,510
like I have to learn how to code I have

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,250
to learn how to code like that's what

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,320
everybody's doing I think that's where

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,390
it's like no you don't unless you want

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,340
to get into a tech job like I don't know

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,440
if it's Berg has any kind of general I

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,830
mean I think so general assembly or any

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,790
of these like boot camps oh not really

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:21,190
yeah which only matter time um put like

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,140
in New York and chance to so for sure

00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,870
it's like you know people kind of quit

00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,640
their day jobs and spend 15 grand and go

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,910
to these three months full-time boot

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,190
camps and now those people are starting

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,080
to have enough work experience and looks

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,010
like a lot of employable people that are

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,010
coming around so it's kind of like

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:42,010
balancing out that overflow of tech jobs

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:46,300
too don't be really interesting like see

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,800
where that is in five years then a

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,290
friend who is talking about how

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,649
programming jobs and development jobs

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,399
are going to become more

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:58,129
and more like you know their traits or

00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,449
like vacations so that's a pretty

00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:02,509
reasonable concern when you think about

00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:05,809
you know how that how economics works I

00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:07,879
think that people want to learn to stop

00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:10,730
be software engineers because they hear

00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,309
about these ridiculously high salaries

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,699
but a lot of that is due to the

00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:18,740
restricted supply because there are as

00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:21,050
many people trained in it so if we

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,119
create all these code schools that's

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,800
gonna lower the salary and then the

00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:28,249
people that got into it for the money

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,660
purposes are going to be back to you

00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:32,720
know making what they made before the

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:35,480
code school in a way not to knock it

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,850
completely just I think that there's an

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,759
angle of that that people don't quite

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,559
consider too often yeah I think I think

00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,110
there's something to be said about like

00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,610
understanding how things how like a web

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,550
site comes together or an app comes

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,259
together and what goes into that and i

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,470
think that's that's very beneficial like

00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:55,759
I understand how my car works like I

00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,829
understand that there's an engine that

00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,899
turns like these Pistons turn this thing

00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:01,910
that then goes to the transmission and

00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,100
eventually turns my wheels but if I ever

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,379
had to design any part of that or like

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,449
fix any part of that there is no way

00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:12,139
that I could do it but I understand like

00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:14,839
enough of it to like understand why why

00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:16,730
it's important and I don't like I kind

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,790
of I it's funny because I've used that

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:23,120
same analogy in conversations before

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:26,230
talking about people have any need to

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,910
understand security around technology

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,889
we're like I've gotten into discussions

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,720
with colleagues and friends before about

00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:36,110
and this is probably a little bit off

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,910
topic but about how i view the fact that

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:43,160
people have to understand anything about

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:46,029
security to be a major a major design

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,350
flaw of the way that we've built things

00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,730
just because i feel like i feel like if

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,839
we just design security in such a way

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,769
than like the average person just

00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,299
doesn't need to care but i like that's

00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:58,249
kind of how i view it like i think it's

00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:59,629
okay for anybody that wants to know and

00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,279
can get an understanding of like what

00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:03,170
does it take to build this thing to

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,700
build an app to build a website what

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,050
does all that take

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,700
but I also agree i don't think that

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,410
everybody needs to be a software

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,640
engineer or that everybody point i don't

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,380
like anybody I don't think everybody

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,890
needs to be able to do any one

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,270
particular thing right yeah like I've

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,030
definitely used that card metaphor

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,310
before too i think because it's like you

00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:27,110
understand enough to know that you have

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:29,370
to pay somebody to fix it yeah yeah

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:34,080
there's going to be different qualities

00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:35,670
of how they fix it so that's mean yeah I

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,400
might alright start saying honestly you

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,020
need to know enough to understand that

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,610
you need to pay somebody it's a very

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:49,680
somebody was looking like a true

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:54,450
consultant there you go another one of

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:58,800
your duties is it like a different vein

00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:01,740
of teaching these CSS CSS tricks office

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,300
hours which seems like you're helping

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,880
people that just are kind of like stuck

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,980
on things maybe you could tell us a

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,660
little bit more about that i'm i'm not

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,300
in the front front end world but i have

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,650
noticed you do this but I um you know

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,080
don't know all that much about it maybe

00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,840
you could enlighten me about what you're

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,150
doing there yeah sure so CSS tricks from

00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,680
pressure everybody who would be watching

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:26,700
this is familiar but if not it's like

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,920
the website for like intermediate level

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,470
intermediate level ish articles out sit

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,840
and like very I mean like a spoiler who

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,490
runs is like just so good at explaining

00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,170
things look so good with teaching and

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,010
education pensive so he um and i'm at uh

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,300
we're actually I met him through the

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,420
cook and meet up in New York because I

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,650
run that code mind made up here and he

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,750
was like oh I wanna do this office hours

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,150
thing at tss tricks so there's a paid

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,260
part of CSS tricks called the log where

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,670
there's a whole bunch of video courses

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:59,340
that he's made over time and to people

00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:01,560
who are large subscribers can also

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,630
partake in office hours and so we have

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,060
there's like a good slack channel and

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,460
then three times a week there are

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,930
teaching sessions so initially we're

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,290
going to like developing the format but

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:15,480
initially it was more an open session so

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,010
people come questions or really kind of

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,520
do off-the-cuff demos about certain

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,470
things but is interesting

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:24,940
not that many people had specific

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:26,860
questions so we kind of moved the format

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,970
to be more about themes and so now what

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,000
we've been doing lately is we actually

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,310
to office hours like staff members

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,340
teaching each other something so today

00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,800
um I meant with Rob please

00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:43,090
pittsburgh-based wiser box key tonight

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,830
is nothing maybe Wierzbowski yeah so he

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,260
we did an office hour session and he was

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,730
teaching me Gulf for an hour so let's

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,230
greatest fun and so to kind of come up

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,400
with a bunch of different there are

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,140
things and they're all recorded on

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,690
hangouts on here which is awesome kind

00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,250
of looking to get this to be more

00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:01,750
recordable and like produced content as

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:05,250
well and that helps me segue into a

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,870
point that I kind of want to make um so

00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,210
you're on this podcast today because

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,580
you're going to be a guest at our

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,920
conference abstractions which we're

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,010
going to formally announce on the second

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,250
of February's armed with our full line

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:23,500

because she's just fantastic at

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,060
presenting uh i think it was like an

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,950
intermediate ish I don't know which talk

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,690
it is to be honest I'm sorry but it's

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,310
like an intermediate ish topic and you

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,460
were explaining it in a clear and

00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:55,330
thorough away while still giving people

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:58,330
a lot of knowledge um and it wasn't

00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:00,190
until after I had invited you and I

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,750
didn't you know know exactly who you

00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,250
were that I found out you have some

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:08,950
Pittsburgh connections yourself um so

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,020
wanna you're in New York now but uh so

00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,990
did you live here for a while or what is

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,790
that all about yeah I grew up about an

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:20,620
hour from Pittsburgh and Scottdale

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:25,240
Pennsylvania nice world rural area album

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:29,500
sticks pretty much so yeah humble a farm

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:31,790
upbringing grew up on a farm and I moved

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,370
to Boulder call

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:37,040
rado for college for two years sent to

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,840
Boston and then I live in put back if

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,360
it's been sitting for two years after

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,120
college um and which was great networks

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,780
with the startup that was called see

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,280
nabol main rest in peace Oh with a

00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,990
couple of really awesome guys and so I

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,960
was an excellent experience and then got

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,720
involved with them a catapult parking

00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,510
space along to my rose more Wow working

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,070
on my own I was fun yeah and go back

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,220
through it a few times a year for sure

00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,500
probably gonna Anna gonna leave New York

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,170
after this year let me go back for a

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,530
little bit he wants some summer so but

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,240
his burns wonderful wonderful city um

00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,680
it's always so my to meet people from

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,410
Pittsburgh when you don't live there

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,890
anymore yeah i mean like steelers

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,930
obviously but this is definitely a thing

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:28,130
yeah pittsburgh is like the secret

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:30,560
center of the universe um cuz i uh i

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,720
lived away for a while I lived in North

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,780
Carolina for a year and one of my

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,620
favorite things to do was wear my pit

00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:41,630
gear out into a public whenever I was

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,270
like just going out to eating get

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:47,480
someone that uh recognized it and they

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:50,090
were from moon township or bellevue west

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,970
view area somewhere saw a really strange

00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,410
that i didn't even like know where it

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,630
was in relation to where i used to live

00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:00,980
in pittsburgh but I knew it was

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:03,530
Pittsburgh um it's a lot of expats and I

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,320
think that um hopefully we can lure some

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:09,320
people back because things are growing

00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,040
here really fast I think that's very

00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,690
much a kind of a boomerang town that

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,010
term so you like maybe get your starting

00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,360
there and then you go somewhere else for

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,460
a little bit and then bring me what you

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,110
know fact like so good examples like the

00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,000
code school thing which isn't really a

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:27,290
Pittsburgh yet but it's like you know

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,910
huge in New York and Manso be

00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,680
interesting to come back and having that

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,660
knowledge and seeing where that is here

00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,190
to try to start something like that in

00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,380
Pittsburgh we just kind of how these

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,890
things iterate in general no it's also

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,390
gets better but um yeah I've been in New

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,600
York licked and a half years now and

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,150
kind of lovely hurt a little bit of

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,310
roughly

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,350
those I got this internship had to do

00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,390
with games more not so still kind of to

00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,750
that but yeah definitely miss it

00:17:51,390 --> 00:18:01,320
whenever I go back and like so glad that

00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:05,640
you were and lift are there now tired of

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:08,040
driving to bars geez yeah that's a big

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:12,930
change we finally uh stepped into the

00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:14,820
current century yes uber lyft have

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:18,090
definitely they've done we made a pretty

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,740
big impact on like my uh like anytime I

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,780
go out anywhere especially I have to go

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,240
on the south side like just straight up

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,210
will not drive down there like I'll I'll

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,620
take an uber lyft oh god it actually go

00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:34,950
there anyways it actually uh even has an

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:38,760
impact on me like a abstractions will be

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:41,340
my fourth conference I'm organizing and

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,380
it's really going to be the first one

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,800
that I've organized when uber and lyft

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:50,280
were in place thorough like entrenched I

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:55,020
think goober was starting uh when I did

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:58,920
still see the Ruby 2014 and I didn't do

00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:02,130
a conference last year so it's something

00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,440
I actually really considered whenever we

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:07,500
bring people into the city from all

00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,380
around the world people I you know I

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,210
want them to have a good positive view

00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,300
of the city and I know that the

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:18,930
airport's so far away and getting around

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:21,030
is kind of hard and you can't find a

00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:23,910
taxi or rely on them even if you call

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:26,190
them so having over and looks like a

00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:31,200
huge impact on the positive view of the

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:33,240
city so it's strange how important that

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,750
really is to making it a modern city

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:39,600
yeah and for people coming at sasken

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,750
foot chase Bogut November was in Austin

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,920
pretty awesome they gave speakers

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,990
everybody know instead of paying for

00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,520
other transportation and well not like a

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,320
they have had everybody stay in here

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,510
babies though there were these a big

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,210
houses of people really fun and then

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,250
everybody got like a little lift stipend

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,510
and I think like people from out of town

00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,820
from the conference that like a little

00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,950
bit

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,050
just count too so it's kind of fun to

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:06,540
like and agreed that that's such enemy

00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:11,490
makes it so much more accessible sure um

00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:15,100
so uh pittsburgh has kind of changed

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:19,390
since you've left out but let's go to

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:25,060
the broader theme of change I like my

00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:27,160
smooth segue there uh how how have how

00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,640
has software in general changed I mean

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:33,910
how I guess how long have you been doing

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,800
software professionally and hot I'm

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,930
truck I tried to do the math in my head

00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,610
and I can't figure it out how have you

00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,840
been doing software freshly how has it

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:47,200
changed in that time period um but yeah

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,570
uh yeah so I guess and then this is like

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,060
maybe just my selfishness thing I always

00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:55,150
have tips a software I talk about what I

00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,310
do then very much focused on like

00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,680
building website contains the web

00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,960
specifically front end so it's gonna be

00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,090
that totally counts as software like by

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,860
definition probably i'm not looking at a

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,090
definition of it but it's kind of funny

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,160
like when people say oh so you're an

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:12,190
engineer your programmer knew your

00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:16,540
software look uh let's no don't call me

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:20,770
that but um that's your question i guess

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:25,560
so wow do i started doing this up in

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,560
like 2010 probably like six years and

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:31,990
like the landscape of the web has

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,580
changed a lot but also not that much it

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:37,110
was interesting because like when you

00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:39,430
get down to the kind of granular

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:42,400
granular aspects i guess like in terms

00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:44,440
of workflow for example task runners or

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,280
such a big thing now javascript is a lot

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,710
more prominent um and responsive design

00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,630
is given now so that's the biggest

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,890
change I think is I kind of remember

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,470
when that was just starting to be a

00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:59,740
thing I only have really made one

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,990
website that wasn't responsive because i

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,600
have wasn't doing it before that and so

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,100
it's interesting to see tear up when

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,260
people are like oh do we need a

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,880
responsive website sick obviously do

00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,580
like that's not even a question anymore

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,620
like let's just

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:16,309
put that to bed and like yes you do need

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:20,330
to have a responsive website and but I

00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:21,919
think with WordPress to theirs and like

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,169
WordPress specifically there's a lot

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,710
more of a focus on that being a content

00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:31,429
management system and also like a more

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:35,120
respective thing because i know i

00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:38,390
remember at it was a SAS thing like a

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,940
while ago and her like I know baby was

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,799
like 2013 or a couple years ago and

00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,500
people mentioned to launch and WordPress

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,320
and everybody was like oh like haha

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,970
wordpress it's like no like WordPress

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,620
crushing it right now and there's a lot

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,350
of really cool stuff going on and like

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,480
focus on very customized things and the

00:22:54,350 --> 00:23:00,799
ability to music way beyond a blogging

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,169
platform so this is some jackman things

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,330
like SAS preprocessors all this tooling

00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:09,490
is getting a little out of hand but

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,490
starting to hone itself back in i think

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:19,519
yeah I've seen that to the tooling is

00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:22,610
probably the biggest change at least on

00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,409
the front end but I wouldn't worry too

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:28,250
much about calling yourself a software

00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:32,679
engineer or us or building software or

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:37,510
at least um if you don't want to use the

00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:39,320
technical term of engineer uh because

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,779
something that we're doing for

00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,929
abstractions is like it's going to be a

00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:46,250
conference about billing software in

00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:47,960
every aspect so like we're going to get

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,220
designers we're going to get back in

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,639
people and we're going to get everyone

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,789
together who helped ship these products

00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:58,789
so I mean it's such a you know it takes

00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:04,309
so many efforts from everyone to really

00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:08,690
look ship a software product um I wanted

00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:17,750
to ask you kind of giving back to the

00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:21,830
conference theme how so how do you

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,659
approach conferences whenever you go to

00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,350
them because I you go to them and give

00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:27,100
workshops

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:33,220
how what's your general approach in

00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:38,240
going to a conference well see i mean i

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:40,700
kind of have to improvise the fair

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,919
amount I mean I whenever I do toxin

00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,890
thing I mean also this is like major

00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,390
life skill and something I think should

00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,620
be like requirement ticking improv

00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,510
that's something I was right into if

00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,539
it's very good set Neil sitting around

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,280
yeah yeah yeah super and in from um that

00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:57,470
just gave me that's like pretty

00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,380
incredible set of skills and like

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,380
confidence um everybody everybody should

00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,360
take into Brock class basically uh but

00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,720
whenever I do talks and workshops and

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,250
things I try to UM out like make it

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,260
outline and kind of format everything

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,440
around like the skeleton of its kind of

00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,940
basic writing skills I guess uh you know

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,510
like beginning middle and end like here

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,010
are the points and then allow you know

00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,440
the actual life terminology to kind of

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:27,950
just come as I give it and I haven't

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,330
really done talks multiple times which I

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,429
would kind of like to I don't want to do

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,669
them so many times its sale I know a lot

00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:36,799
of people end up doing I mean advocates

00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:38,870
tale but in terms of like the conference

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,250
circuit like in what design is a big

00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:44,390
thing like people kind of get the same

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:46,039
talk a lot of places um but I like to

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,010
keep like a lot of little holes and

00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:53,169
think so opens it up for various topics

00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:53,169
come up and I try to you know ask people

00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,780
do you make dumb jokes students please

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,150
good but I think Lee attending

00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,320
conferences also really like mainly what

00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,910
I've done like I've spoken the few

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,450
places and trigger before press stuff

00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:12,820
but attending conferences is like best

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,010
money spent anybody who works for

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,600
themselves a lot of times hesitates to

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,370
drop five hundred dollars on a

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,140
conference which for sure it's a lot of

00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,930
money but every time you go to a

00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,540
conference and I'm quoting Dan mall on

00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,490
business ology podcast I think here it's

00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,930
like whenever he's been running a

00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,670
conference raise your rate accordingly

00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:33,870
because you're becoming that much more

00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:37,120
valuable by making these connections and

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,770
being exposed to all this new content

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,530
and like what you're listening to people

00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:44,080
that are like making the industry talk

00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:46,300
about what is happening and it's so so

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,520
valuable and like more than the pots of

00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,540
courses people you meet and it's kind of

00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,130
fun when you go to a few different

00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,350
conferences you end up having conference

00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:58,240
buddies you're like oh hey look I saw

00:26:53,350 --> 00:27:00,520
you there saw you there though and you

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,770
get to maintain those friendships over

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,380
Twitter and everything like it's so

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:09,190
weird that I have friends that I met

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:12,220
once and are across the country and but

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:14,860
we keep up on Twitter because we met at

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,770
a conference yeah and like depending on

00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,180
what your work situation is it triggers

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,420
your work for yourself or work remotely

00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:25,840
you're not necessarily going to have

00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,400
those exciting conversations about your

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,880
work and about people that are also

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:33,850
really stoked about SAS or like you know

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,500
England whatever so it's the opportunity

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,840
to have those conversations and kind of

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,220
affirm that you know you're doing the

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:46,680
right thing if you're still excited

00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:49,750
about it um how do you so what's your

00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:53,080
approach for those conversations with

00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:55,480
people because I know that I'm not great

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,010
at it still myself approaching a

00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,400
stranger that I know has something in

00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:04,500
common with me and saying a SAS is cool

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:07,420
or something like that like do you do uh

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,610
apply any of the same improv things dude

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,080
what do you just really think what do

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,870
you think you're doing there

00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,610
to make people you know to connect with

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,519
those people that's a really good

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,529
question because particular look just

00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:22,570
east coast mentality i think it's all

00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:26,409
about oh so what do you do little blah

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,850
and then you end up giving you have meet

00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:29,590
a lot of people who had a conference and

00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,110
just like the general you depending your

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:34,539
little spiel like your three-minute

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,710
elevator pitch about sick oh yeah this

00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,850
isn't this in this and then you're just

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,309
really checked out from the conversation

00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,080
it's not great like i say have to cover

00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:44,110
that content at some point but i just

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,440
try to I don't know when I'm in like a

00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:49,450
room people I don't know I guess try to

00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,000
talk about something else like whether

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,500
it's I really enjoyed small talk I think

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,260
you can get really into song talk and

00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,580
sometimes up better than just exchanging

00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,539
like the same viewpoints you've been

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,059
talking about and then those

00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:02,769
conversations can happen like actual

00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:05,190
conversations about tech stuff or

00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:07,330
whatever getting really opinionated and

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,220
passionate about the topic I think are

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:12,039
better had like over drinks or something

00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,049
rather than like right away I mean we'll

00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:17,620
talk about what talks to you for sure

00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:20,039
but I would like to start out by like

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:24,279
making comments about the food or the

00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:27,100
city something bad to be honest also

00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:29,169
good tip is to dislike so about people

00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,909
that are standing by themselves or just

00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:33,580
like walk up to a group like it's never

00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:36,730
it's a hard thing to do just be like oh

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,870
hey look I'm listening me but just kind

00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,059
of like your tongue and every but

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:44,500
everybody's already know so I think if

00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:47,710
you can can swallow that or yeah and

00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:50,139
takes practice for sure but I always

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:54,389
rule of thumb try not to dive right into

00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:56,950
like what do you do what do you work

00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:57,880
which I don't know I go back and forth

00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,769
about that because it is a good

00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,970
conversation starter you may you might

00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:03,159
be like oh yeah I am somebody that

00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:07,360
somebody but let maybe let it rise more

00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:10,510
organically oh yeah definitely working

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,389
and everybody's awkward t-shirt now cuz

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,429
then I feel like that will be my defense

00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:19,240
about being awkward is like I could just

00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:22,330
point to the t-shirt I just be like yeah

00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,549
it's cool just like the most awkward and

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,940
then I like and then I like soy burger

00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:27,880
way

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,500
whoa I think the most awkward thing you

00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,270
can do is just walk into a circle of

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:35,650
people and just point that your shirt

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:38,440
else that'll be awesome that would be so

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,270
awesome yeah and being incredibly

00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,880
awkward but that'd be hilarious with

00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:47,200
everything like nobody's having like

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,690
Smith people like chatting at a

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,300
conference interrupting them a little

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:54,370
bit to be part of its like never bad and

00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,810
people I mean I think those people would

00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,640
definitely like you the only downside is

00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,920
they would probably remember their party

00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:04,150
remember you as the awkward guy like

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:08,380
that would be your nickname uh-oh change

00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:12,000
my campaign to the awkward guy calm you

00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:15,370
doesn't take it to some fouls yeah

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:22,270
valdon figure out how to have the domain

00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:26,380
extension be RS or something um I really

00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:28,300
like your approach of joining a group

00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,610
that's already talking I didn't realize

00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,890
that but when you were saying it kind of

00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:36,340
sparked thought in my mind that some of

00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,720
the best you know conference friends or

00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:43,300
whatever they have our people that I met

00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:45,700
in a group or came into our group uh I

00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,670
think it's important to not it's

00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:51,070
important to not hang out with your

00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:53,830
friends at conferences that you already

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,510
know but if you're in a group of friends

00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,030
like there's three of you and then you

00:31:55,510 --> 00:32:00,010
bring in another another person that's

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,530
not connected to the group the

00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:04,720
connections there is just so much easier

00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:06,250
because you're already talking with your

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,230
friends about something and then that

00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,870
person can jump in and add to the

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,790
conversation and then they become hardly

00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:16,150
group of friends and then another person

00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:18,760
income in later so yeah looking for

00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:21,250
groups and looking for people that are

00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,370
alone to pull into a group it's really

00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:28,240
good for sure yeah I think you how long

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:31,210
those lines is the speaker aspect too

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:35,290
and not like being afraid of speaker

00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:37,990
it's like this no can eat it against to

00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,919
keep mentioning Sassenach but um they

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,470
did such a

00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:43,450
good job with having more of a level

00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:46,330
playing field like speakers and

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:49,059
attendees and not being afraid you like

00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:51,700
it was okay hi like what's up you know

00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:53,559
whoever I like your tongue click oh

00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,869
Allah and then don't talk about what

00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:58,419
they do they talk about something else

00:32:54,869 --> 00:33:04,690
so confuzzled s is like a big thing this

00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:06,970
time for other topics in um but yeah one

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:09,460
of that reminds me of like the jam

00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:12,159
sessions from steel city ruby and like

00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:13,960
like like getting a bunch of people

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,869
together just like play the ukulele or

00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,379
something or like yeah stuff like that

00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:22,330
yeah that seems like it's the least

00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:24,549
conference related thing to happen but

00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:26,649
also probably one of the most positive

00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:32,019
things and one of the cooler experiences

00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:35,710
I saw it was the late great Jim wyrick

00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:38,139
brought a ukulele and I think PJ

00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:42,340
Haggerty probably brought uh some sort

00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:45,340
of acoustic guitar and franklin chen i

00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,039
forget what he brought but yeah just you

00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,359
know everyone getting together around

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,570
people just bringing instruments and

00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:55,330
seeing what happens it seems so strange

00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:57,509
but if i'm sure it had a lasting impact

00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:00,340
on all of them and the people around

00:33:57,509 --> 00:34:03,609
yeah yeah i think if you gonna not look

00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,619
at it as networking if you can like

00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:07,809
abstract the networking part away from

00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:10,929
that as much as possible the better time

00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:12,309
you'll have I also i mean i'll be the

00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:14,079
first one to say this and I know it's

00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:16,599
probably not a great thing to say but

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,889
you know alcohol helps a lot like when

00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:22,540
you're around like heaven-sent drinks

00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:24,790
it's really fun like I know there's like

00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,940
a Twitter argument about this last year

00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,889
or something about like having options

00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,859
that aren't drinking for people that

00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:34,659
don't drink and it's like okay I

00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:36,220
understand that but same time I very

00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:37,839
much enjoy drinking it's pretty fun to

00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:41,500
do at conferences make some good friends

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,990
i yeah i think that uh you know the

00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,929
board games option is just like it

00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:49,839
serves almost the same purpose as the as

00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:52,829
the drinking option it's like something

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,409
to do together and something too

00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:56,909
full out emotions because those board

00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:03,390
games pipe pull out emotions just as

00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:04,890
much as alcohol sometimes ya just don't

00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,719
play the game of thrones board game

00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:10,109
because then you will not be friends

00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:13,769
with any of those people at the end just

00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:15,119
as a warning also you might you won't

00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:16,829
make it into the conference the next day

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:32,339
because you'll still be playing probably

00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:35,729
yeah that's true just take forever what

00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:40,950
else you got for me boys let's got

00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:43,289
awkward ah i was going to defer to Alex

00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:47,519
just so just to clean clear up my

00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:53,880
awkwardness Oh check out my everybody's

00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:55,890
awkward t-shirt yeah yeah yeah uh oh uh

00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,309
i don't know i don't want to go from

00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:02,309
here yeah i usually rely on the last

00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:06,329
thing and then i think i forgot a topic

00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:10,410
uh but we're at about like 40 minutes

00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:13,049
anyway so we could wrap up the show what

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:16,259
we could do I know what I do besides web

00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:23,249
design yeah yeah we do okay yeah

00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:27,630
actually yeah yeah well thanks out all

00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:29,249
day yes I like like cocktails and

00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:32,459
spirits a lot so I'm kind of a nerd

00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:34,799
about about that stuff like tequila how

00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:37,650
do you get into the bespoke cocktail

00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:42,479
design and everything yeah I like a nice

00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:45,029
little home bar set up here um I don't

00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:47,759
know if these places existed when you

00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:50,339
were in pittsburgh but there it's kind

00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:52,499
of an emerging thing harvard in highland

00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:54,630
probably did yeah oh yeah I'm pretty

00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:57,539
from Pittsburgh cocktails oh yeah I know

00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:00,779
yeah very close friend um who worked at

00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:04,320
but trying to ride and salt before my

00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:06,000
salt rest in peace ma but yeah she can

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,730
got me into the whole cocktail thing

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,970
noise like kind of flirting with the

00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:14,070
idea of non doing web stuff forever and

00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,470
trying to try out some service industry

00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:18,000
think it's not a good way to break into

00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,940
it in New York it's pretty cut through

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,430
here but sitting like service industry

00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,590
is very fascinating and like to

00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:27,510
experience that not even as a bartender

00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:32,370
which is something along those lines

00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:35,490
it's a whole other realm of as kind of

00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:37,590
like dealing with people that makes you

00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,510
weigh conscious way more conscientious

00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:42,090
as likes on the go sir restaurants it's

00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,890
been like I don't know like thirty five

00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,570
percent of my life in bars and

00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:48,380
restaurants probably completely new york

00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:50,910
because it's like what you do here um

00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:54,600
what i think that's that's interesting

00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:58,170
and yeah yeah like reading about lose a

00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:01,260
lot i think go running sometimes i think

00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:04,080
that the service industry is a valuable

00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:09,090
thing for anyone to do in their life

00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:12,980
like working in a restaurant it's very

00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:16,740
hot for sure humbling sorry humbling and

00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:18,780
it makes you hungry to not have to do

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,820
that sometimes if you were at a 15 year

00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:25,650
old dishwasher like i was and that was a

00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:28,620
not something i want to go back to doing

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:33,420
that is you sweaty and I feel like it

00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:35,670
also I feel like it also like um gives

00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,020
you such a different demeanor and

00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,980
appreciation when you go into a

00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,180
restaurant right like you're a

00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,830
completely different person if you've

00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,960
worked in a restaurant or worked in the

00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:45,690
food service industry at all you're very

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,980
you know very different person for

00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:51,750
having done so yeah I have this fix it

00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,030
I've never worked in a restaurant before

00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,740
but have like busily because in New York

00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,440
it's really hard to meet people like

00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,420
make friends here so I ended up having

00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,100
he had a couple of neighborhood spots so

00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:05,010
they go to I now my friends they're like

00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,830
people that work there and so I was like

00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,910
kind of weird insight but not insight to

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:12,000
what it's like I've never actually

00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:14,400
worked in a restaurant so I come on that

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,099
at some point but I think yeah I like

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,650
that

00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:20,109
and taking an improv class this could be

00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:23,440
some like life requirements maybe I

00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:27,970
think ah you've you've convinced me to

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,150
add an improv class to the abstractions

00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:33,220
lineup because we're gonna have nice

00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:36,999
nice distraction distractions track it's

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:38,799
very much non-luxury type things and I

00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:42,309
think that that would fit in real well

00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:44,859
if if our regular member remy is

00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:47,170
listening Remy get us in touch with

00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:49,960
someone I've been totally like I mean

00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,249
this talk about this not on podcast what

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,039
did I definitely know some people

00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:55,329
Pittsburgh who'd be interested pink

00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,400
absolutely yeah you should uh nice

00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:59,890
submitting probably know because this

00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,950
works so friggin small hey everyone

00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:05,589
knows that yeah for real or at least I

00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:07,450
next it's really interesting but yeah

00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:09,579
it's really interesting I was um like I

00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,809
was biking up on Mount Washington over

00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:11,920
the summer and like we got to this

00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:14,289
clearing where there's just like no

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,779
trees and I look like you look out you

00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:19,119
can see everything in Pittsburgh from up

00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:20,769
there but you can see the whole the

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,700
whole thing and it's just kind of like

00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:26,619
it's not that much land area really like

00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,200
it's like not a big it's not a big area

00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:30,969
it's not you know mm-hmm it's it's a

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,880
tricky city though because it has little

00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:35,380
pockets it's it's like oh yeah it's one

00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,749
of the few cities with pockets of

00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:41,410
civilization because of the geography of

00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:42,969
em yeah I think that it also has roads

00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,619
that go to weird places where you're

00:40:42,969 --> 00:40:46,650
like oh I make a left here and then all

00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:50,999
of a sudden how do I get on Fifth Avenue

00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:54,819
you're a bridge you're like wow I can't

00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:56,380
yeah exactly basically uh ninety percent

00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,719
of the time you're driving you're on a

00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,489
bridge yeah or it's like yeah the

00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,349
fastest way to get somewhere is not to

00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:06,369
like follow on land that's like cross

00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:09,880
the river and I across it back yeah what

00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:13,029
is not about I I grew up doing that yeah

00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,219
the fastest way to get to uh maybe the

00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:17,469
only way to get to the waterfront was to

00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:26,410
go across one bridge and then across

00:41:17,469 --> 00:41:29,969
another across the same river ah ok so

00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:33,489
let's uh oops I'm gonna throw another

00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:37,450

having me and uh how do people hire you

00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:54,819
because you you do independent stuff so

00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:56,940
what ya plugs plug something okay i'll

00:42:54,819 --> 00:43:00,759
put this thing called the tackle box

00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,859
which i am working on it's kind of like

00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:06,759
a it's going to be a panelist part-time

00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:08,319
side thing but just because I teach web

00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:11,259
stuff in a few different places and

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:14,469
always imperative by how other people

00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:17,680
run things and so I want to just kind of

00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:20,109
run a class on my own terms so if you go

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,479
to not Laura com there's a little link

00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:24,910
somewhere or tackle box not more calm

00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:27,430
and so they're all about it's all about

00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:29,619
building WordPress websites like really

00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:32,079
cleanly and responsibly and of learning

00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:34,450
some best practices and enough knowledge

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,060
to really build your own website and

00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:37,460
have a

00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,270
pet project based learning styles or

00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,480
rather than sitting and watching

00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:42,380
tutorials and the WordPress

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,960
documentation is a little all over the

00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,980
place there's a lot of old blog posts

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,050
and things out there that are very

00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,970
confusing so I want to try to distill

00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:52,700
that into a nice little curriculum so

00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:57,110
gonna be starting a class of play in

00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:59,330
February so check that out cool oh so I

00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,710
have one final question actually so do

00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,900
you actually fish or do you just enjoy

00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:06,320
fishing as a metaphor because which I

00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:10,840
don't show has like oh actually got that

00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:14,600
idea Pittsburgh I know adam nelson oh um

00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:16,070
yeah he I was like explaining kind of

00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,420
teaching philosophies like oh so it's

00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,750
like fishing you should do that somehow

00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:22,460
I like figured out how to break that but

00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,830
yeah people get a lot of conference

00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,800
before Lee can understand that I think I

00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:31,070
think you have a nice a lot to draw from

00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,450
on that on those metaphors yeah yeah I

00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:35,360
love something I try to incorporate into

00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:38,900
a fun teaching technical things break it

00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,990
dance something kind of visual unrelated

00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,730
yeah thank you yep all right well thank

00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:46,580
