tender love on the Internet yep I am a

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,659
Ruby programmer I'm on the Ruby court

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:29,040
seen the rails for team and many other

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:35,040
projects as well and I like programming

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,600
and cats two great things to have if if

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,909
you don't already have the programmer

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,479
shirt we started selling that on the

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,840
codon supply website I have one yes yeah

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,200
we we paired up with Lindsay betta who

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,000
did the art for that and started selling

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,880
it just recently nice but anyways uh I

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,570
want to start with the most fun question

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,060
I think other than questions about

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,229
seatac and Gorby off those will be fun

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,229
but those I'll save those for later

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,759
where does tender love come from

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:25,560
oh boy okay sorry I laugh every time I I

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,930
have to tell his Thoris um it's all

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,750
right so I was hanging out basically I

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,379
was hanging out with a bunch of friends

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,920
of mine and they all happen to be women

00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:41,370
and we're watching movie and a friend of

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,010
mine says um what is the grossest thing

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:50,239
a guy can say to you and my other friend

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,239
says I want to make tender love to you

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:56,129
so I registered I registered I

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,019
registered the website and made it a

00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:59,970
technical blog and i sent my friend a

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,439
link cuz i knew she would freak out and

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,750
she's like I was like you gotta check

00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,900
out this website it's really great she

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,060
responds to me is no I'm not checking it

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,310
out at all and I'm like no really just

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:16,530
look and then she saw and it was just

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,870
you know my my blog so like that was I

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,530
mean basically the whole name came from

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:25,409
me just I don't know trolling my friends

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,109
that was that was basically it the name

00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:31,769
was too long on IRC so I just shortened

00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:34,590
it up and that's that's that's that all

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,540
so well and I I don't know I stuck with

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,269
it to be honest like I stuck with a name

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,250
because I always feel like I always feel

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,379
like when you see program or handles I

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,069
mean I think a lot of people go by their

00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:48,629
real name these days but um typically

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:52,250
programmer handles will always be

00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:55,290
something like I don't know you know I'm

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,060
awesomeness or you know like super

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,340
hacker or what out you know what I mean

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,260
like that that type of stuff and I just

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,099
like I like this name because it's like

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,459
it's just it's just not serious right

00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:13,040
it's just yeah it's like in the 90s when

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:16,349
everyone was like Viper skull yes yes

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,560
like dr. Hecker names require force

00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:22,440
called and uh well wasn't like super

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,350
death the what was the guy from the

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,220
hacker movie like uh

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:33,080
sure I'd crimes over at zero cool 0

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:41,350
colon is your uncle okay mr. the plague

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:44,390
I think if the team was zero cool and

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:52,490
crash overload and tender love in that

00:04:44,390 --> 00:05:00,350
movie I actually think it might have fit

00:04:52,490 --> 00:05:03,770
right in actually ah yeah so that's that

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:07,520
is it is just I don't know having fun

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:10,040
that's all yeah having fun is a jokes

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,960
are important uh Justin I'll tell you

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,360
every time we do like a build night most

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,680
of my projects are just jokes like I

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,840
just come up with something that I think

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,620
it'll be funny and I make a quick

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,960
website or something yeah I mean it's

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,110
well the thing is like I'm afraid I'm

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,510
afraid people take programming too

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,940
seriously or just like do you know

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,500
especially especially on the internet it

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,220
seems like people are very serious very

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,800
serious about stuff and I just I don't

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,900
like to be that way it's just yeah I

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,830
mean at the end of the day it's just

00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,020
programming right like it's it's much

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,820
more making plan on a t-shirt I mean

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,830
it's it's much more important like the

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,300
connections we make with people or like

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,270
human interactions you know what I mean

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,760
exactly that's really way more important

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,630
to me than than the code that we're

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,540
working on necessarily so I mean that's

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:09,470
why I just like I trade to the lights

00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:14,000
you know yeah yeah and like um I yeah

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,290
identify grew that it's it's um I've had

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,970
something I was gonna say and I forgot

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:21,380
what it was well I have a that leads me

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,730
into kind of something I want to talk

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:28,670
about with Aaron is your kind of your

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,680
friendly and fun demeanor is one of the

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,140
better things about basically the Ruby

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,380
community and like you're definitely

00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,760
unique in your own way where you create

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,940
Friday hugs

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:45,200
and it just can make a lot of great puns

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:51,380
on Twitter and still be taken uh with

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:56,840
right show me one show me one sign that

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:58,490
isn't great um actually if Emma on

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:04,570
tonight today if you weren't sick she

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:08,270
would tell me a few that aren't great um

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:10,940
but you still managed to be held in high

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:16,250
esteem and I think that's kind of

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:19,670
important do you do you do some of what

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:24,290
you do you know with this attitude this

00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:26,150
fun attitude intentionally or is it just

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,830
a product of who you are naturally and

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,380
it just shines through or what do you

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:33,680
think or anything or is it makes I'm

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,260
sure oh well definitely it's definitely

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,910
mixed like I mean I really like I really

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,760
love programming a lot and I love to do

00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:46,240
it I mean I love to do serious work and

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:49,070
serious stuff uh but you know it's just

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,630
if you're always serious all the time it

00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,400
can get kind of dull and it's the same

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,030
as if you're always doing like if you're

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,640
only doing jokes all the time too it's

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,860
like I just like to change I like to

00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,750
change that stuff up you know like one

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,150
of my well two of my favorite things are

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,970
you laughing and also learning those are

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,740
my two favorite things so if i can make

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,890
people laugh or teach someone something

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,050
that it makes me feel good so that's why

00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:18,170
i like that's what i like to mix it up

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,580
because you know doesn't just do my

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,940
favorite things to do and if i can share

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:27,680
that with other people then I I feel

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,790
good about it weird spent on me like

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,870
that reminds me of what I was gonna say

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,950
yay I remembered um so yeah you're

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,130
talking about like at the end of the day

00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,870
we're developers need to like it's about

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,590
the people who work with um I think

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:44,440
there's this sort of feeling generally

00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,450
within programming communities that

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,660
programming is like this really strict

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,410
sort of science ii thing that's like

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,819
Deveaux

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,769
first from human interaction but

00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:57,889
basically what we're actually doing is

00:08:54,769 --> 00:09:01,339
making software for people so it's like

00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:03,259
kind of the other way around so it's

00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,720
good to have to like keep that human

00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:08,899
element of like light-hearted and and

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,290
all that stuff and keep that and you're

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:14,689
in your mind as well yeah I think I

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,610
think programming is a there's there's a

00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:18,949
huge spectrum of things that you can do

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,589
when you're as a programmer I mean you

00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:24,439
can go all the way down to just only you

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:26,750
know mathematical type theoretic stuff

00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:29,509
that that is totally divorced or you can

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,829
just you know you can go to an other end

00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:32,300
of the spectrum where you're not you

00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:36,079
know you're not doing any of that stuff

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:39,050
at all but ya ne na placed in there when

00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:42,019
you can I think when you better relate

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,160
to other people uh you can convey what

00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,230
you're actually trying to accomplish

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:50,420
better regardless of where you are on

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:54,860
that where you are on that range I guess

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:57,199
so yeah being able to being able to

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,000
relate to people and you know laughs

00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:00,470
with people and get along together as

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:11,769
something that's extremely important to

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:18,939
me and laughing puns yes um so weird I

00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:22,310
think I relate to this feeling of being

00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:26,569
super you know I think super motivated

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:30,230
by making people laugh and I was always

00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:32,630
kind of the kind of kid that would put

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,660
that at the fort forefront of my

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:38,990
priorities and make people laugh over

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:42,230
getting good grades and stuff did were

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:44,839
you kind of like a goof off is it like

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,089
me or were like what do you I don't I

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,910
don't want to spend like the whole show

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:52,639
talking about you being like it if you

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,529
do too funny person but I just want to

00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,120
like find out like this I'm just

00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,649
thinking about like how i was when i was

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,139
kidding oh I liked to make people laugh

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:02,000
and how like you said that's when your

00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:04,750
favorite things that's just always been

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,920
one of my favorite things honestly

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,010
honestly I never really thought about

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,110
that when I was when I was a I don't

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,230
know when I was younger I didn't when I

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,300
was in school I didn't really do that so

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,500
much I was pretty I think I was pretty

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:23,800
shy like and then the reason I do it now

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,290
is because the reason I started doing

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,180
that type of stuff or just having fun at

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:33,340
work is mainly because I was really

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:35,350
really bored I like it's just I was just

00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,770
so bored at work that I would just like

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:41,560
I don't know come up with my mind would

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,480
just wander all day right like I'd be

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,430
compiling some Java code for like 10

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:50,380
minutes and what am I gonna do what am I

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:51,670
gonna do for 10 minutes right so I'm

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,630
just saying they're just sitting there

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:59,260
thinking about weird stuff all day I

00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:01,030
don't know like then I just started then

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,030
I just started telling people that weird

00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,710
stuff and I think like I think I've

00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,790
always thought about weird stuff it's

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:13,630
just that I didn't tell anybody about it

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:15,339
until I got older I was doing no it's

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,810
too self-conscious when I was younger I

00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:18,190
was too self-conscious to tell people

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:23,740
about it but now I'm just like I don't

00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:25,660
care oh that looks I was gonna say until

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:31,030
that last sentence that it sounds like

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:32,350
programming tribute to insanity you

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,860
could front you could probably say that

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:40,410
might be true or at least uh Javas

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:47,520
compile-time journey though oh yeah okay

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:49,510
um so I guess it's kind of talk about

00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,170
you know how you got in that position

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,970
because I know the Friday hog came about

00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,980
because you were bored cuz do you worked

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,740
at home every every day and you were

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:03,460
lonely on Fridays and yes big hug the

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:06,070
Internet how so what's your career been

00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,520
like in terms of remote it looks like

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:11,920
you're at home now or you have a really

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:17,530
cool office that lets you bring a cat

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,430
tree and seatac with you um but how long

00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,420
have you been

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:24,100
working remotely uh let's see i'm

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,810
currently i'm currently working at red

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:31,000
hat and i've been working for them for

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:34,300
over a year i want to say maybe a year

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,730
and three months or so and then before

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,529
that i was working at AT&T and those are

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,450
the two jaw these two jobs with only

00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:44,620
ones that I've done remotely and that

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:47,500
would be I want to say five or six years

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,890
now probably six years I think it was at

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:59,170
eighteen t for four or five years so six

00:13:50,890 --> 00:14:03,730
years yeah and uh what uh what is your

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:06,010
overall like career arc so far like

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,440
where did you get started in the world

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:12,339
of programming in terms in terms of

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:16,029
professional and and where are you now

00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:19,510
like what is your role now sure so I

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:25,589
started uh I got my first job

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:29,200
programming when i was 18 i I'm 35 now

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:31,720
so I've been programming for about 17

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,100
years professionally I guess I got a job

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,540
in programming in order to pay for

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:40,839
college and then I dropped out of

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:46,060
college essentially to continue could to

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:47,830
continue programming I mean I started

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,970
out just as essentially a front

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:53,830
end-front end also back in web developer

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,390
I mean we were at a very tiny company I

00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,400
think there are only two programmers at

00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:03,850
the company so it was like we had to do

00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:05,560
everything uh and then I don't know I

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:09,190
guess like more and more as my career

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:13,060
has gone for moved forward I've gone I

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:17,230
guess farther and farther down the stack

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:19,300
of stuff essentially so I mean I do I

00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,180
can do any of it now but I get more and

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,190
more like now I'm much more involved in

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,520
like the internals of the Ruby

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:30,240
interpreter rather than I don't know

00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,130
writing some javascript stuff right hey

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,340
that's

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,200
it seems like that's my career paths did

00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,500
you major in computer science when you

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,930
were going to school uh yes that's where

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,540
I started was to go through well it was

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,820
actually a computer engineering okay

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,070
just apparently the same thing is

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:54,660
computer science but fewer language

00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:57,900
requirements so uh yeah that's that's

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,760
where i was going then i dropped out how

00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,410
did that how did that affect your job

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,920
prospects i mean you already had a job

00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:08,580
didn't you when you were going to like

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:11,430
yeah I did um I honestly like I think I

00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,290
was incredibly lucky so I i do not

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,930
recommend my career paths for anybody

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,450
like this i don't recommend it at all

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:21,360
like i was extremely lucky to get that

00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:25,110
first job and getting that first job is

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,990
really what helped me to helped me to go

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,710
along i mean i got that job in that was

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:34,290
in nineteen nineteen ninety nine oh yeah

00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,720
i mean i've been a programmer all the

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,120
way through the 1st bubble all the way

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,330
till now I've been a programmer the

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,100
entire time in getting that like getting

00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,960
that first experience or getting that

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,010
experience with that first job is really

00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:55,800
what really what helped me a lot but to

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:57,210
be honest like not having a degree is to

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,930
me it was a to me it was a good thing

00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:03,360
and a bad thing it was a bad thing in

00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:06,329
that I always like I've always felt

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,339
insecure about myself in my position

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,930
because it's like you know you don't

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,180
have a degree how can you how can you

00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:15,240
get a job right or how can you maintain

00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:17,790
a job but on the other hand it's also

00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,650
been that insecurity has also been an

00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:23,760
extremely good motivator for me so I

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,860
study a lot on my own so I you know I

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,660
study a lot of things I read a lot of

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,000
books and it's all because I feel like

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,120
well I never finished school so I

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,370
probably ought to learn something right

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:41,430
so I don't know I think if I could go

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,220
back and do it over again I'd probably

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,690
well honestly you know if I could go

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,799
back into it over again I do the same

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:51,389
saying yeah because it depends on the

00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,759
time like it all depends on the time

00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:57,389
right that timing for me was just

00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,039
perfect I mean I think a better route is

00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:02,220
to actually finish school and continue

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,049
studying afterwards I'm afraid that I'm

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,700
afraid that if I had gone to school and

00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:08,029
actually finished my degree I never

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:14,009
would have continued to improve myself

00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:18,809
right right at all I don't know I don't

00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:21,299
think that it's it hasn't it hasn't

00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:25,649
limited me not having a degree hasn't

00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:32,340
limited me but I also feel like i am a i

00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:34,049
am an exception so um i would not tell

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:39,269
people to just drop out of school I

00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:44,610
think it's a super bad idea okay oh it's

00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:46,950
state school hey kids drop out smoke

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:51,139
cigarettes actually so actually my last

00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:53,899
when I worked for when I worked for AT&T

00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:56,370
so it's kind of weird i worked for a

00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:58,019
first time work for ATT interactive

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:02,730
which was a wholly owned subsidiary of

00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:05,639
ATT then i went worked for ATT directly

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:10,649
but in order to work for AT&T i had to

00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:12,960
reapply for my job uh and they made me

00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,970
fill out they made me submit a resume

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,440
and also fill out one of the likes fill

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:21,299
out a form online um you know right off

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,879
a resume and then fill in exactly the

00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:29,190
same stuff in a for ya so I i did that

00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:31,740
and i had a had a check fox like you

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,690
know have you graduated from school and

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,570
I was like ah you know I do you have a

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:40,799
college degree and I'm like home man you

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:44,820
know I don't want alive so I didn't

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,409
check it and they didn't hire me like I

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,269
got automatically kicked out of the

00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:50,909
hiring process because of I even though

00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:53,039
like this was this job this job was mine

00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:54,570
it was mine for sure it's just that I

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,279
had to go through these you know go

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,919
through these particular roles and my

00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:01,879
boss at the time like I was like

00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:06,600
yeah uh I just got rejected for this job

00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:08,700
automatic and he's like oh no so he

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,609
actually had to go head to go to the

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:15,269
interview talked to the CTO of eighteen

00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:17,909
t about me see create the CG you know of

00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:19,470
athe about me and explain why they

00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:22,710
should hire for me even though I didn't

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:27,809
have a degree so so this is what I'm

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:29,960
saying like don't you know if it weren't

00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:32,809
for if it weren't for where I am today

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:37,609
not having agree would be a huge

00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:40,619
hindrance I said right yeah yeah so

00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:42,749
that's what I say because you couldn't

00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:49,379
even get the job that you already have

00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:52,139
yes exactly yes yes so like I mean if it

00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:55,139
weren't for the very fortunate luck or

00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:58,470
my luck then I'd be in a world perk

00:20:55,139 --> 00:21:00,929
right now so yeah I think it's also

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,669
important to not discourage people that

00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:05,249
don't have a degree because I think more

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:07,080
and more people are willing to kind of

00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:10,200
accept people that don't have a degree

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:13,169
or a stamp you know a pretty standard

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,600
education because yeah you know there's

00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:17,879
so much so many ways that self teach

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,769
programming specifically on that it's

00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:22,769
you know changing changing the time

00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:24,450
quite a bit oh absolutely college isn't

00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:27,210
so like college is absolutely not the

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:30,899
only way to do you know to do to learn

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:34,109
how to have the skill um like there's

00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:36,539
tons of great you know great schools out

00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:38,309
there today that are like it's it's fun

00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:41,669
you go through those schools you can do

00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:43,529
exactly what I do it's you know whatever

00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:45,119
it's fine but if you're if you're

00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,879
someone who's out there and is making

00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,940
the choice like okay I'm in school now

00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:52,399
should I just drop out I don't think you

00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,489
know I don't think you should do that

00:21:52,399 --> 00:22:02,429
yeah uh so it's something you said

00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:06,749
during that bit it's kind of an

00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:09,929
interesting topic I think that I talked

00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:12,100
to Tiffany about this before um where

00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:15,730
she actually she did

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,260
a good podcast on the code supply I

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:21,280
guess loan think we have like a network

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:24,929
where she has her own show about how she

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:29,140
doesn't feel she did feel in place at

00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:32,549
her at school she's Tiffany won't you

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:37,870
give Aaron like a 10 seconds feel of

00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:41,110
your bio yeah I am I'm in school now and

00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:44,730
I'm around your age and it's kinda it's

00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:48,400
kind of difficult to UM feel in place

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:50,890
where I'm at I'm going to pit and I'm a

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,760
computer science major and it's a little

00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:57,100
bit difficult to want to stay um when I

00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:07,500
feel like there are so many other people

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:11,500
that have it have youth as their uh as

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:16,179
their I don't know uh ally I guess just

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:19,000
didn't yeah and I would say like you

00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:22,690
know I've I've encouraged to me to not

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
let thing feeling out of place stop her

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:30,070
from achieving and something that you

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,020
said made me kind of think about this

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:40,720
subject again because someone as

00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:43,360
accomplished as you earn and you know

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,770
you've like you're well known and you're

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,780
good enough to be on this podcast but

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:50,440
you still have those kind of feelings

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:52,030
like you shouldn't be somewhere and you

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:57,610
especially feel them because you don't

00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:59,559
have a degree do you and I remember when

00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:01,360
we hosted Steel City Ruby here in

00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:05,429
pittsford you were nervous to give one

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,380
of our keynotes it was just you know

00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:12,309
funny to think about someone that's well

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,860
known and has this outgoing personality

00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:15,970
being nervous about being on stage I'm

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,730
thinking they're not supposed to be

00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,860
there they're not qualified um deep

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,740
thank you I can understand indefinitely

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,260
understand the feeling out of place part

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,280
I actually so if I

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:34,600
they dropped out of college three times

00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:38,110
wow I don't even know how you

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,360
logistically do that I'm not comment on

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:43,030
it like from an emotional standpoint but

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:47,280
just logistical e it's difficult I'll

00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:49,360
tell you it really so so okay I'm like

00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,710
throw something I will tell you that the

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,330
computer science department at the

00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,710
University of Washington's is it is

00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:58,060
extremely competitive uh and they in

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:01,480
order to get into the department you

00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:05,230
have to have like a 39 at least in my

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,050
grades are just not that good right so i

00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,180
would like I went back to school several

00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,190
times like try and increase my grades

00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:15,090
and i'll tell you it totally sucked cuz

00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:18,040
you're like I'm in there and I'm like

00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:22,300
seven years older than everybody else

00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:26,140
lipstick just like hey everybody that's

00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,820
good it's it's kind of awkward because

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,370
they're you know everybody in your class

00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,250
is talking about like you just your

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:35,470
lives don't match up at all right I'm

00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:40,950
like I'm like well I already have a job

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:46,330
i I'm I'm I gotta worry about you know

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:48,310
paying bills and like you know just

00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,680
stuff stuff you have to worry about

00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:53,650
right and right everybody else in my

00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,060
class is like oh you know this the

00:25:53,650 --> 00:26:00,840
things I have to worry about are totally

00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:04,240
different so it's just it's weird uh the

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,740
UH but as far as like as far as speaking

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:12,130
of stuff was concerned I don't know I

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:14,320
get late I mean yeah it's speaking

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:19,150
always speaking always makes me nervous

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:21,460
I just uh I think there are people who

00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:24,520
are you know better spoken than I am or

00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:26,140
more qualified for the job than I am so

00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,600
I get these i get these weird kind of

00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,340
feelings like why am I you know who

00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,910
cares what I have to say I just tell

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:38,080
pawns on Twitter it's fine anybody can

00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:40,120
do that and it's it's funny because um

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,300
cones flies like an orange

00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:47,730
where we have it's like it's kind of its

00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:52,390
part meetup apart community in part

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:54,160
podcasts things like this and I often

00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,170
have to convince people that they have

00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,360
something interesting to say I think

00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:01,320
that people don't realize that they know

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:07,330
something that's useful to someone else

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:09,820
so it it's like yeah why would someone

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,590
listen to me but you know you know you

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,970
know more than basically everyone knows

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,520
more than someone about something

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,960
something yeah and you just got to

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,210
figure out what that something is and

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,750
you can talk about it I'll tell you how

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:24,700
I got a lot of uh yeah I was gonna say

00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,440
have a lot of unfinished blog posts and

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,940
I do is they're just all in my head I

00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:33,030
think hey I should write a blog post

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:35,920
about that and I'm like no nobody cares

00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:41,620
why bother no no one's gonna read that

00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:43,810
anyway but I think it's probably I don't

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,410
know it's it's a very bad attitude for

00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:53,830
me to ask but I I mean I'm gonna do

00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:58,290
right I'm human I just found out um this

00:27:53,830 --> 00:28:02,290
week that both Adele and see I have

00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:05,080
stage fright and Adele has basically

00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:08,320
gone like three years without performing

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,370
in front of a large audience so you're

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,790
not you know you're not alone you are

00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:17,940
like the Adele of the Ruby community

00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:21,010
that's basically what I'm not saying

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,860
well what I do ulta so I'll tell you my

00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:27,490
i guess i don't know if it's a secret

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:31,270
but my what i do essentially is before i

00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:33,640
give any talk I'm always really nervous

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:36,010
so I'm very nervous there's a few so

00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,590
there's a few things I do and a few of

00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:42,030
them are few of them were practical I'd

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:45,760
one never bring your cell phone on stage

00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:48,280
like because that old inevitably

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,930
somebody is going to call you or but you

00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,360
know you'll get messages or whatever and

00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,600
it'll even if your phone just buzzes

00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,600
it's still Knesset

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,940
do with that that weird like beeping you

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,280
know I mean so don't bring yourself up

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,530
on stage always go to the bathroom first

00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,850
Joe I always do that because you don't

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:09,669
want to be on stage and have to go to

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,669
the bathroom that's like bad news um

00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:15,770
that went wrong for me once uh I'll tell

00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:17,390
you about that later if you care to hear

00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,010
and then also make sure your pockets are

00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,169
empty like no change for anything your

00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,820
pockets all right so I do that like

00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,470
that's my ritual make sure I get all

00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,900
that stuff ready and I'm still nervous

00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,820
at that time but I get up on stage and I

00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,490
start giving my talk and the first like

00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,289
I always tell like I always tell jokes

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,659
at the beginning of my talks and it's

00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:39,440
because I'm ridiculously nervous right

00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:44,030
I'm sorry just saw my wife in the

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,890
background I'm always I'm always very

00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,260
nervous when I get on stage so I tell

00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,030
these jokes lite try and loosen myself

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,460
off and try to get the audience on my

00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,850
side and then I get into talking about

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,470
technical stuff and it's just that like

00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,970
so I do that I tell the jokes to give

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,280
people with me and then wasn't I get

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,890
into the technical stuff like I just I

00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,809
really love when I get into it I really

00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,340
love teaching people like I love

00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:09,470
teaching people about things that I know

00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,970
so if I can talk about things that I

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,470
know and help people in the audience

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:15,020
that it makes me feel good about myself

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,240
and by the time I get into that stuff

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,520
it's like okay the the fright is gone I

00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,980
don't care anymore i'm telling people

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,840
you know teaching people about the stuff

00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,419
that i know and i just need to focus on

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,630
that and everything is fine I mean it's

00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:31,970
not first that first like I don't know

00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:35,780
five minutes or so when you first get up

00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:40,820
there it's just ah yes that's the hard

00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:44,059
part and I teach a lot so that's like an

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:46,789
eight hour straight talk basically um

00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:50,539
and what you said about cell phone like

00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:53,450
if your cell phone buzzes it kind of

00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:57,260
takes you back to that starting point of

00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:58,700
your talk where you're really like

00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,990
thinking about everything you're doing

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,900
again because you had that interruption

00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:05,030
and then you're just like you get in

00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:08,780
that same nervous state again

00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:10,490
yeah I'm gonna have to stop holding my

00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,830
phone in my pocket when I steeped even

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,300
because yeah if you if you get

00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,940
interrupted it's basically like your

00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:19,790
packets is that square one might as well

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,770
just have like five jokes prepared so

00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:25,780
that you can get interrupted four times

00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:29,270
and still have one for a buffer love it

00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:32,060
I had to do I used to teach a I used to

00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:34,340
teach me okay so this is fun I dropped

00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:38,720
out of I dropped out of the University

00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:40,910
of Washington and I wintertime this is

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,260
the third time this is the third time so

00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,060
the first time the first time that

00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,130
dropped out of university of utah the

00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,870
second time i dropped out of seattle

00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,970
central community college and then the

00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:54,140
third time i dropped out of university

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:58,880
of washington okay um it's just really

00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:05,990
get the timeline that's all yeah I have

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:08,930
like maybe it for calculus books I smart

00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:12,050
I have like a small fortune in college

00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:14,030
textbooks in my closet because none of

00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,520
the credits transferred and all of them

00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:21,410
required a different book no no no no

00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:23,600
the the the UM the classes did require a

00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,490
different book but each time the credits

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,950
transfer but the problem with my GPA was

00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,530
so low that I was retaking like I camry

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,570
taking classes alright but since i was

00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:35,150
dropping up this is very very bad I

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:37,400
guess college strategy is since I kept

00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,800
dropping out in between they change of

00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:43,970
books each time I started going I went

00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:48,110
back to school so don't drop out don't

00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:51,200
drive out it's not cost-effective what

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:52,580
are we talking about uh yes yes okay so

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,570
I dropped out of university of

00:32:52,580 --> 00:33:01,940
washington and then i started teaching a

00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:03,440
ruby course for them so i tawt I taw a

00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:08,780
ruby course for a university of

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:10,700
washington for about two years and it

00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,740
was interesting except that we have each

00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,880
of our classes was like three hours long

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,680
I don't know how anybody can do that

00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,720
long like when I given when I

00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,230
given talks it's an hour long I'm just

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,300
dead I am dead at the end it's like all

00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,160
the energy is drained out of me I like I

00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,950
just want to collapse somewhere three

00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:35,120
hours wow I can't imagine teaching all

00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:37,670
day I relate to that so much because I

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:42,680
mean the way you do is you basically

00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:45,830
break it up into like 51 our talks it

00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:50,900
looks like a lot of interactivity to

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:55,220
like need to break them down but yeah

00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:57,320
like teaching it's so mentally training

00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,970
that you just want to like just lay in a

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,320
bed face down for the rest of the night

00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:04,460
after you do eight hours and I I hear

00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,710
the same thing in your voice when you

00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,460
say three hours it's just like your

00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:12,380
brain is going the entire time so it's

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,690
symbology not just that but when you're

00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,550
when you're giving a talk you you're

00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,600
trying to teach people something you

00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,550
need to make sure to keep their

00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,830
attention so it's not enough just to

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,710
it's not enough just to convey the

00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:26,150
information you also have to be like you

00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,340
have to be excited about it you have to

00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:30,170
maintain it to maintain the audience's

00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,210
attention otherwise they're they're just

00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,500
going to drift off not you know not get

00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,380
anything from what you're trying to

00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,230
teach all right so you can't you can't

00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:42,200
just say okay here is here is the info

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:45,680
it's not that's not good enough it's not

00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:50,240
enough so it's really draining for

00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:57,470
teachers so the timeline here has me

00:34:50,240 --> 00:35:00,770
with a question um did you drop out get

00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,630
on the Ruby core team and then go to

00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:05,000
back to school and where there was a

00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,710
class on Ruby because it would be pretty

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,500
hilarious if you were in a ruby class

00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:14,570
like an intro Ruby when you're on the

00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:17,150
rupee core team uh no I don't know if I

00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:19,460
was on the core team at the time I might

00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,260
have I might have been I'm on the I've

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:25,490
been on the core team for many years i'm

00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:29,580
not sure to be honest I'm not sure it's

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:32,220
a it's probably it might be it might be

00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:34,560
the the professor's just saying things

00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,740
and you say well yeah that might be

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,400
right now but I'm going to go change it

00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:43,290
just a mess to them but actually the

00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,970
class that I was teaching was and was an

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:47,220
evening course so it was actually like

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:50,000
it's actually really nice I mean and

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:53,070
everybody was everybody in the class was

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,230
party they're all working people and all

00:35:53,070 --> 00:36:01,380
basically you know my age or nipple so

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:04,350
everybody had life everybody had stuff

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,750
in common so it was like it was it

00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:09,690
wasn't good it was a good class to teach

00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:12,210
it was weird though when uh when I

00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:15,060
talked to the guy in charge I was like

00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:18,720
the guy hiring me my boss I guess I was

00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:21,090
like so you know I dropped out of

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,520
college are you sure it's okay if I

00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:31,620
teacher and he's like just don't tell

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:35,480
anybody and you'll be fine like okay and

00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:39,000
it never came up in class so yeah I

00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:44,160
think that you could also could have

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:47,210
probably deleted all of a ruby for you

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,050
know the entirety of your semester and

00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:52,320
taught nothing and you would have

00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:59,790
technically met your job criteria yes

00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:01,350
absolutely you know lays a nice little

00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:04,800
technicality there you might want to

00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:06,690
consider that's the next time I think I

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,660
think you have control to delete all of

00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:12,930
her Ruby right I can it's true yes I

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,760
might get in trouble for but yes from

00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,100
from everyone's computer just doesn't

00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,470
exist anymore oh yeah god I can do that

00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,480
to me yes but that's because your

00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,220
magical powers not because of core

00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,780
committer yeah you've seen that star

00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,640
wars right where these got to lightning

00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,640
from the hands I can do that no problem

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:48,960
but with both code yes

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:52,320
uh um so I think the you know the the

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:57,180
other theme of the show is well the

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,470
other the main reason you're on today is

00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,320
because you're going to be coming to

00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:02,840
pittsburgh for the abstractions

00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:13,290
conference you're going to be talking

00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:14,550
how can you go got me right when i see i

00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,980
told you to do it when I was not

00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,350
expecting it and it made such better

00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,060
results you know it's not gonna make

00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:23,820
it's not going to make any sense on the

00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:26,430
audio voters no no but I you do mock

00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:30,210
ideas will have to tell people like to

00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:36,180
go into like this the 30 minute mark or

00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:39,840
so and much errands tiny hands can you

00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:43,140
for the video audience recreate the

00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:51,540
following emoji um how about the praise

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:57,360
one oh yes okay okay and then I can kick

00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:59,090
kick can you can you do hold on let's uh

00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,500
let me click on you so you have focus

00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:12,980
can you now do the hashtag blessed I

00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:12,980
started was I don't notice uh yeah yeah

00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:27,790
that's it I'm glad that we did that I

00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:33,590
mean now we have encouraged people to

00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:37,480
see video version of this oh I'll use

00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,480
that one as the screen cap for this

00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:46,580
that's good anyway one of the reasons

00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,780
you're here today is because you're

00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,870
coming to Pittsburgh to talk at

00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:55,610
abstractions in August and one of the

00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:58,790
emerging themes that we're seeing with

00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:01,660
our invited speakers is a theme of

00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:05,780
change around software and how it's

00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:09,170
different than it was in a way what do

00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:11,930
you think how do you think things have

00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:19,330
changed over the time you've been doing

00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:22,820
it professionally oh boy let's think um

00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:29,900
huh how the software changed since I've

00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:34,040
been doing it family hold on scratching

00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:36,410
with the little hand a lot of stuff a

00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:43,210
lot of stuff has changed I'm trying to

00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:45,920
think of a good I don't know like good

00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,810
one good thing to say or one particular

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,100
change right I'm turn think of one

00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:53,270
particular change because it's just very

00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:56,780
slow it's just very slow changes right

00:40:53,270 --> 00:41:00,830
we used to have when I when I first

00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:07,520
started programming or when I was a had

00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:09,230
my first professional programming job no

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,260
it's not a very good story no more

00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:15,220
ignore I said that one thing I think is

00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:18,020
interesting or that's changed a lot is a

00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:21,850
social media this is kind of a weird

00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:24,110
thing to say the like when I you know

00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:27,290
when I first started programming there

00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:29,810
was no there was no hacker news

00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:32,810
right there is no reddit or no nobody

00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:37,130
really nobody really there was no sort

00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:39,530
of pop culture around programming you

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:42,110
know what I mean like there was no there

00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,570
was no hip technology like he didn't say

00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:47,120
nobody was at work going on man we

00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:48,910
should switch everything to do a big day

00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,650
you know what I mean like there's no

00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:53,630
there was no there was no hip technology

00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:59,150
essentially it was like okay we just do

00:41:53,630 --> 00:42:01,730
I gotta do this thing use the little you

00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,130
know use a programming we use a database

00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,840
for it and I can the first main hip

00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:10,400
thing I remember was people saying like

00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:12,440
Oh or the first hip hip pneus argument i

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,120
remember was garbage collection people

00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,100
weren't sure about garbage collection

00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,350
like Oh are we sure that's a good thing

00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,270
and people like yes it's good thing this

00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:23,240
is hit now you should do garbage

00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:28,340
collection but the the the number of

00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:30,530
like i would say subjects of pop culture

00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,410
like the number of them per year or per

00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:36,110
amount of time has definitely increased

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,610
like it gets it gets faster and faster

00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:40,070
it seems to be getting faster and faster

00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:42,110
as we move forward time right like

00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:44,360
there's no the amount of time it took

00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:46,760
for some particular bit of technology

00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,400
the hip back then was a lot along right

00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,610
so garbage collection to the long time

00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,010
it was a long time span we found a good

00:42:52,610 --> 00:43:00,050
yes it was good whereas today is like

00:42:55,010 --> 00:43:02,930
just thing after thing you know like

00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:05,450
right as know all these things

00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,400
coming at you so quickly so quickly you

00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,630
have to keep up with well I don't even

00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:14,330
know if you have to keep up with it

00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:16,760
anymore i don't i don't but i think

00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:19,570
that's like that's what i see that's

00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:23,480
what i see the most is this this sort of

00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:27,980
pop culture around programming so I I

00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:33,260
mean I think it's weird i don't think

00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:35,050
i'm a I I guess I I guess I'm a part of

00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:39,790
it even though I don't really want to be

00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:41,950
uh-huh because i don't i don't care

00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:45,640
just it's just it is what it is that's

00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:46,780
our that's our life to pay so I think

00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,460
that's probably one of the biggest

00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:53,220
instead of changed and of course i can

00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:56,950
say stuff like well oh we went from

00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:59,500
distributed computing where like for

00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:01,990
example well no first we started out

00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,250
with mainframes I think when I though

00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:05,680
that was before I started going to

00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,300
school then we had like mean we did we

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,430
had main for instance cool but nobody

00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,470
used them to distributed stuff where

00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:13,300
people would put apps on their computers

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:16,120
back to centralize where we have

00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:19,030
websites and stuff not to decentralize

00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:22,720
where we have javascript in people's you

00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:25,960
know people's browsers and you see these

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,840
things wing these sort of swings back

00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:31,930
and forth over time but I don't think

00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,910
that's as interesting as the old pop pop

00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:36,610
culture thing I think that's like that's

00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:38,410
a weird that's weirder seeing explains

00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:41,080
and technology doesn't seem so weird to

00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:45,060
me it's that like why do we have why do

00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,060
we have this pop culture thing so weird

00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:52,950
yeah it's I mean you know the figure a

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:56,710
large part of it is like Twitter where a

00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:59,380
bunch of nerdy people wanted to use a

00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:00,730
new software product and one of the

00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,460
things that they could follow on there

00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:07,210
were software other software engineers

00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,830
yes I created this community I did you

00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:11,500
know it probably goes back a little

00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:13,690
further than that but I think that was

00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:20,530
probably one of the big reasons that

00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:24,940
there's this new software like um you

00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:27,520
know fame and like a culture pop culture

00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,800
well I think it's also I think it's also

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,810
that today I suspect I mean I have zero

00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,940
numbers to back this up but I suspect

00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,890
that today there are more there are just

00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,690
more developers today than when I

00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:39,850
started like there's just more people

00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:43,060
programming today like the field has

00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:45,940
just gotten massively wider and I can't

00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:47,530
as I say I'm completely speculating on

00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,120
this I have no idea if it's true or not

00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:51,160
but there's just so many more people

00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,610
programming today that this this

00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,400
inevitably happens

00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:59,660
you know and not to mention you have

00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:05,450
like I think I think that programming is

00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:08,510
also getting easier so we're uh we're

00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:11,210
widening the few i suspect that today

00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:14,600
there are far more okay this is going to

00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:16,070
be really confused in the city hey back

00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,750
when i started programming the skill

00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:19,070
level that I was you know there's a

00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:22,010
certain number of people who have that

00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:23,690
same skill level I think today people

00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,850
have that same skill level it's it's

00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:28,610
much wider like there's just more people

00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:30,140
overall total plus we're pulling more

00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,470
people into the community because I

00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:35,060
think programming is getting easier I

00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:37,610
building for example when rails email

00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:39,740
building web site became way easier and

00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:41,840
much more if broaden the community of

00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:44,870
people that could actually use it right

00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:47,660
so more people more people could call

00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,980
themselves programmers and I think it's

00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,080
a good like I think it's a very good

00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:53,330
thing I think bring more people and it's

00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,740
very like a very good thing but it is

00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,510
one of the things that have changed that

00:46:54,740 --> 00:47:01,610
has changed like I think it's getting

00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:04,460
easier and I'm wondering you know I feel

00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:09,710
like it's more much more viable to have

00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:12,830
a business that is software now then you

00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:15,020
know ten years ago like now now your

00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:17,390
entire business can be your software

00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,890
whereas you know ten years ago your

00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:22,310
business was kind of supported by

00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:28,790
software so like all the software jobs

00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:31,130
were not the focus um but now like that

00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:34,100
can be a career path and that could be a

00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:36,560
way to be successful and get rich and

00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,630
everyone wants to do it because of you

00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,420
know you can build an entire company

00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:43,040
that way well one thing one thing I

00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,060
think is pretty telling about technology

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,750
I'll tell you one thing that has changed

00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:50,570
over the course of my career is that uh

00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:52,970
this so this Christmas my parents bought

00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:57,050
all of the Christmas presents on amazon

00:47:52,970 --> 00:48:00,500
so that was like a big deal that was a

00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:04,550
really big deal in my family they bought

00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,390
all this stuff online so I mean yeah I'm

00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,860
the group

00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,900
more and more people are using it you

00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:12,410
can build you can build your products

00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:14,540
comply online it's just yeah I think our

00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:19,250
our society is getting to be more and

00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:21,260
more dependent on software so and who

00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:24,920
knows where it'll go with the saturation

00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:27,050
of everyone buying amazon I think it

00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:30,860
will just lead to a whole new level of

00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:32,810
this um yeah I'm wait I'm waiting so

00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,270
self started cars that's what I want

00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,950
wait to get no I don't get me started on

00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:40,520
self-driving cars will be here all night

00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:43,520
I love self-driving cars I want them so

00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,890
much I want want like everywhere all of

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,600
them I can't wait I cannot wait for us

00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:50,240
to get rid of our car just feel like off

00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,130
to something where a self-driving car is

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,220
gonna hit it on your app one shows up

00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:57,740
you're done yeah yeah yeah you're like

00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:59,510
I'll be right there with you if I can

00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,090
actually election program while I'm on

00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:04,540
the car done you can think of all the

00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:07,820
time we would save and save so much time

00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:11,480
yeah definitely yeah Justin's probably

00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:14,240
like they hijacked my show it's not the

00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:17,450
automatic car show no we're talking

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:23,090
about code ann sablan code and supplies

00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:24,920
and uh automatic cars oh sorry go ahead

00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:27,590
I was gonna say that's a new theme of

00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,380
the show couldn't spying on my cars one

00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:36,770
of my favorite office supplies is his

00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:38,540
favorite clips I love those just do you

00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:40,550
know the boeing has paper clips that

00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:43,580
look like airplanes really like a

00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:45,590
handout shows and stuff yeah I don't I

00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,540
had one in my bag but they're at their

00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:50,600
priests week I was hoping that they only

00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:52,910
used paper clips that were shaped like

00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:58,820
airplanes in the entirety of like Oh in

00:49:52,910 --> 00:50:00,590
my office yeah I enjoy you I enjoy paper

00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:03,770
clips because they make really good like

00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:06,020
the castle of them they love to just the

00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:08,560
great cat toys you can make them like I

00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:13,310
don't have any paper to clip with them I

00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:15,110
just sometimes I turn you know you can

00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:18,550
turn them into a thing like that jumps

00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:18,550
in the air I love me out

00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:27,710
making something in the air and then the

00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:30,740
cats are like uh Erin do we do we do we

00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:33,440
want to know the bathroom story before

00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:37,520
Mike end the end the show is like should

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:40,099
we end the show on that or like or we

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,349
listen no no no it's a good it's a good

00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:44,720
story it's a good story I told the story

00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:46,730
it told the story of railsconf because I

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,490
happened to rails cops I can tell you oh

00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:53,619
I can tell you now if you want to hear

00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:56,780
oh ok let's all right let's do it so I

00:50:53,619 --> 00:51:02,089
always before I give any talk i always

00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:05,020
go to the bathroom first and uh i was

00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:08,030
giving a keynote at railsconf and i get

00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:09,830
even more nervous there because it's

00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:12,320
like the Lions was like 2,000 people

00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:14,030
right you give it a talk I've give it a

00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,820
talking for a 2,000 people and I'm just

00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:18,740
freaking out so I can't think about

00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,320
anything I'm like well I gotta go to the

00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:25,220
bathroom before I get on stage I go into

00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:27,080
the bathroom and I notice there's nobody

00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,440
there's nobody in the bathroom and I

00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:32,089
like okay that's fine and I see that

00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:36,349
there is just a whole bunch of the

00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:37,849
stalls and I don't see any urinals and I

00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:39,890
just assumed that the urinals are

00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:42,560
somewhere else so I go and I'm like

00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:45,260
that's fine so I go in the stall do my

00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,030
like I'm like sitting there like okay I

00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,760
gotta give a talk I to get a talk I

00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:56,780
leave the stall and I look up and I see

00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:59,869
um I see a janitor in she's a woman and

00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,310
I'm like well you know that's what I

00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:03,260
don't like I don't mind if there's a

00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:06,109
woman janitor and the men's bathroom

00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:08,990
it's fine like there's no it's fine and

00:52:06,109 --> 00:52:11,240
then I see like I see somebody washing

00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:17,540
their hands and it's also a woman I'm

00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:22,160
like oh no like that is that that is the

00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:25,609
moment at something else with me she's

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,400
like get out of here and I'm like do I

00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:32,609
wash my

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:35,099
what do I do if I just run out and this

00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:36,960
is literally this is literally three

00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:39,510
minutes before i'm getting on stage in

00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:48,440
front of 2,000 people and give you the

00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:52,109
truck so that was that was extremely

00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:53,880
nerve-wracking but i'll tell you um so

00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:55,529
when I gave my when I gave my talk that

00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,049
you're actually just i just opened with

00:52:55,529 --> 00:52:59,670
that story and everybody everybody died

00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,170
laughing they didn't believe me and of

00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:04,319
course like somebody actually tracked

00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:12,210
down the some may track down the janitor

00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:14,099
to verify fish well yeah so you know

00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:16,440
that's another pro tip is to make sure

00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:23,970
you use the right make sure you use the

00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:29,760
right restroom I don't know how I give

00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:33,450
us a keynote at last you just have to do

00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:38,510
it just have to do it you're on stage

00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:38,510
yeah just got it do it you can't quit oh

00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:51,270
I think that was a very nice uh kind of

00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:54,000
high enough to end all this on um I I do

00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:56,400
want to say the one way that stories

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,349
that have been better is if whenever you

00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:15,569
