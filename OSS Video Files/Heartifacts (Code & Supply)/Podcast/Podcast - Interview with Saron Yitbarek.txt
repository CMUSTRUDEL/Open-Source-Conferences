and we're live great hi everybody and

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,980

supply podcast today we have special

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,950
guests around apart the founder of code

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:16,760
movie and p.m. at Microsoft and we're

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,949
going to talk about code newbie and

00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,750
beginning encoding in general and we

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,380
have a few people here to help us do

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:29,160

Emma won't you introduce yourself oh I'm

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:16,049
Emma um probably seen me it seemed

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:23,759
couldn't buy things for me hi I'm

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:26,640
Tiffany um yeah and uh finally our

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,560
guests around a park hi everybody I'm

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,060
sehran and I do code new be it a bunch

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,090
of other stuff that I'm assuming we're

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:37,470
going to talk about yeah we absolutely

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,420
are uh Iran won't we start with a you

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,560
know your whole story and how you got to

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,020
where you are right now it's kind of

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,470
along the lines of the shows general

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,750
topic of code movie where you know uh

00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:55,399
you wanted to learn how to code from a

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,930
different world and you made it happen

00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,070
yeah that's a great kind of one-liner

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,399
way putting it I might have to steal

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,520
that from you but yeah it started I

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,409
guess it was four years ago when I

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,479
graduated college I moved to the new

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,760
york city area to do journalism and I'd

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,700
worked for NPR and I moved up here to

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,980
work for discover magazine

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,660
and during that time I read the Steve

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:37,250
Jobs book which for me really changed my

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:39,799
because that may have been Emma okay all

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,630
right I'm gonna keep going so yeah so

00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:45,080
the Steve Jobs book really changed my

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,299
life for a bunch of reasons the big one

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,120
being that here was a story of this guy

00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:53,269
who built products and did a lot of

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,160
techy stuff that I'd always you know

00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:56,569
assumed meant that you had to have a

00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,269
computer science degree and you were

00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,010
like a gamer you know living in mom's

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:02,630
basement kind of you know coding and

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,329
doing dungeons of dragons kind of that

00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,010
very very stereotypical idea of what a

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:09,500
programmer looks like and I didn't

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,829
really fit that and here's this guy who

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,870
was not that but who was instead a

00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:16,670
storyteller and a designer and an artist

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,920
and a bunch of other things that I could

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,290
relate to personally and so I read that

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,290
book and I said huh maybe there's a

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,910
place for me in this tech world and so I

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,829
started doing a bunch of research i

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,290
looked into a bunch of different tech

00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:32,269
startups in the new york city area asked

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,639
a bunch of people out for coffee and one

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:36,170
of those coffees turned out turned into

00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,720
an internship and then two weeks into

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,019
the internship turn into a job and i

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,310
spent the next two years working at tech

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,620
startups doing things that were not

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,150
technical so i've done marketing and

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,980
sales and business development at a

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,750
bunch of other things and i felt like

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,150
every time I was hitting this wall

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,310
because what I really wanted to do was

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,470
build products I really wanted to build

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,280
things for users and I couldn't do it

00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,900
because I didn't know what I was talking

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,139
about and I didn't know how things were

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,269
built and so I decided to quit my

00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:07,760
startup job and learn to code for a few

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,410
months on my own I'm doing treehouse

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,169
code school you know a bunch of those

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,269
online resources that are either free or

00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,010
just really cheap and then after a few

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,380
months of that I got accepted into a

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:24,130
programming boot camp and now I'm here

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:27,970
and I think

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:31,900
myself Alex and Emma pretty standard

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:36,070
paths to computer science I know and I

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:39,190
actually went to the same school so I am

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:42,520
we had the same pure technology

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,740
programming education Alex you had

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,080
confuse my screen as well right oh yeah

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:51,700
I've a computer science degree from pitt

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:54,420
and but Tiffany you uh you started the

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,950
whole thing late how about you know like

00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,920
your parallel is too strong because

00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,120
you're doing self talk to and I know

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,980
that code newbie has been really

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,200
important for you getting to where you

00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:12,310
are uh yeah um I I was originally an

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:15,430
English major a long time ago and I felt

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:19,330
that it you know I I wanted to be a

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:22,210
writer and um with that I mean I've

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,420
written all my life and I wrote fiction

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,420
and poetry and um but that you know

00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:31,330
going along that path is not necessarily

00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:35,260
something that you can make a living off

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:38,320
of and while I always well I always

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,470
enjoy tech and always wanted to build

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,910
things I didn't think that was a viable

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:48,400
solution for me until just recently so I

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:51,520
i started to self teach and i'm

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,280
currently at Pitt right now I'm going

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,080
the computer science route but I still

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,560
want to I still want to teach myself on

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,880
web languages because I think a lot of

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:11,050
what I'm learning if it is not is not

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:19,030
web um web-based and um I i find that

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:23,920
I'm not miss um let me pause um I find

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:28,750
that I enjoy a computer science route

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,760
I'm not exactly certain if going to a

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,900
boot camp will be right for me because I

00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,760
don't have the money to do that but

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,860
there is a thing called Viking cold

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,919
school

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:45,810
where you don't have to put any money

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:50,099
down and you can go to their their boot

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:52,110
camp online and um once you get out and

00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:56,520
get a job than you put down eighteen

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,409
percent on the tuition so um I really

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,419
would like to get out work very very

00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:09,949
soon I'm I've been in school a long time

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:12,270
and um I don't know I guess I guess a

00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:14,279
computer science I mean I know that

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,669
having a degree is something that's

00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:22,279
important but I'm not sure how important

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:25,500
it is yeah so strong did you um

00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:30,379
consciously choose the self-taught route

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:32,580
for relevance um like because like

00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:35,219
Tiffany was saying a lot of what you get

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,409
taught in you know universities these

00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:40,650
days is still not relevant to what's

00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:43,229
happening at least on the in web

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,719
technology it gives you good foundations

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,279
but is missing quite a bit is there a

00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:50,639
reason you kind of went you know a

00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,810
self-taught direction yeah so I don't I

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,520
don't really think I qualify a

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,650
self-taught because I did go to a school

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,240
right I went to a non-traditional not

00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,569
accredited school but I did go to a

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,370
formal structure with you know where we

00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:04,229
had a Dean and a syllabus and a

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,550
curriculum and all that I think it's

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:08,069
very different from a lot of people in

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,569
our code newbie community who are you

00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,639
know basically just doing online

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,409
tutorials and blog posts and really

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,409
really hacking it and I have so much

00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,759
respect for the people who turn that you

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:20,370
know into a career I think it's so much

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,819
harder than what I had to do but I

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:25,830
decided to do the boot camp route over

00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,680
the I guess college degree is that kind

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,020
of what you're getting at yeah some

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,149
clothes for that yeah and it's really

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,469
just about you know what is the fastest

00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,760
way I can get to my goal you know

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,349
everything that I heard about getting a

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,930
computer science degree as it applied to

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,729
the startup scene in specifically and as

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,409
it applied to web technologies and being

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,269
able to build products really quickly it

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:48,449
didn't seem to be a really great

00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:50,520
solution to get there and you know one

00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:51,779
of the most popular concepts and tech

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,850
startups is the idea of an

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,399
vp right your minimum viable product and

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,889
so from an MVP standpoint it made a lot

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,420
of sense to spend a fraction of the

00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:02,370
money in a fraction of the time at a

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,829
boot camp first and then if I decide I

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,689
didn't work out you know then than to

00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:08,879
maybe consider doing a masters or

00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:10,620
another undergrad but here the idea of

00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,300
going back to school for another you

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,449
know two to four years to get a degree

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,339
that was just way too just too much in

00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:21,209
terms of time and money and I'm a little

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:23,009
too impatient for that yeah I'm

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:25,879
impatient for that as well I mean I've

00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:30,059
been going to school a long time and I

00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:33,480
guess a lot of the recruiters that come

00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:36,240
and hit me up on LinkedIn want someone

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,110
with a bachelor's degree and I don't

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:44,579
know if that's standard um but yeah I

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:46,290
don't get any offers that don't require

00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:49,829
me to have a bachelor's degree or some

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:55,370
level of experience so how did you how

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:57,629
did you work to get over that barrier

00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,220
yeah so I wonder how much of that is

00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,620
regional right because I'm in New York

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,839
City where we have a lot of you know our

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,129
technical system is is very large you

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,250
know we're very proud of it we're

00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:10,439
actively cultivating it and growing it

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,029
and you know we were very much competing

00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:14,610
with Silicon Valley to be silicon alley

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,680
right so there's a lot of investment

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,269
from the city and from big companies and

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,920
small companies to really make sure that

00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,620
there are a lot of opportunities for us

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,120
I don't know what that atmosphere with

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,800
that ecosystem is like in different

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,290
places so I think that might you know

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,809
that's probably a huge factor but in

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,850
terms of me specifically what I did you

00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,860
know I think that it's very important to

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,540
be good at what you do but I think it's

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,490
more important to show people what

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,550
you're doing and I think that a lot of

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,920
mistakes that are mistakes is a little

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,290
bit harsh one thing that I wish code

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,329
movies do differently is I wish that

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,610
they were as vocal about what they're

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:52,639
learning and what they're doing because

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,350
I think that when you are out there

00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,569
podcasting and blogging and tweeting and

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,029
speaking and volunteering and organizing

00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:02,339
and doing all these things you end up

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,800
you know as a byproduct of those

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,720
activities you end up building a network

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,070
you end up building your team and that's

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,360
how I look at it you know whenever I do

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,430
is speaking engagement whenever I'm

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,430
tweeting I'm thinking of it as okay you

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,019
are now part of my team and on my team

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,440
you know we have this goal of making

00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:21,480
code and the tech industry a better

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,370
place to be and so we're going to help

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,140
each other if that means that you know I

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,459
find out about a job that I think you're

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,140
a great fit for we're on the same team

00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,269
I'm going to tell you about it if you

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,680
find out about a job or an opportunity

00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:33,510
that is going to be great for me you're

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,399
going to tell me about it and so you

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,050
know I think one of the biggest mistakes

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,209
i'ma call this one a mistake the biggest

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,670
mistake you can make is to learn and

00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:43,920
grow in private right in this isolated

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,230
place where only you know what you know

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,120
that is the worst thing you can do

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,769
especially as a beginner when you're

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,480
just starting off and you don't have a

00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:53,070
track record you don't have companies

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,540
backing you a lot of people in our

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,390
community don't have a computer science

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,589
degree and in that situation if you're

00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,839
learning in private and you're not

00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:03,029
telling people you're making it a lot

00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,589
harder for yourself to actually get

00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,050
those jobs so one thing that I've been

00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:09,029
very purposeful about is being very very

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,520
vocal when I first started learning to

00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:13,290
code you know I learned how to turn the

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,600
background yellow with CSS and I tweeted

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,730
about it I told everybody about it you

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,649
know when I was reading the Zed Shaw

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,050
book I think it was learned sequel the

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:23,610
hard way I didn't have any real opinions

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,180
on the book so I just quoted the book

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:29,459
and just like a live tweeted my reading

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,930
of the book and Zed Shaw saw that and he

00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,100
reached out and he said hey I see you're

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,959
reading the book how do you like it and

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,399
we started talking and then when he came

00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,709
to New York City we ended up getting

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,839
lunch and now we're friends because I'm

00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:41,730
very very vocal about everything that I

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,770
do so I think that is one of the things

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,029
that if you start doing in your career

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,130
whether it's in tech or any other

00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:48,899
industry I think you'll end up finding a

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,089
lot more opportunities than you will if

00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:54,240
all you're doing is learning in private

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:56,160
and just relying on job boards that's

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,399
interesting um that you say that because

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,170
I'm I'm very vocal but not necessarily

00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,510
inclusive and I do a podcast

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,389
guy named Nick lash that I met on

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:13,459
linkedin I guess that's that's sort of

00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:16,190
how we met I was posting my blog post on

00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,510
my podcasts and other things on linkedin

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,980
and he sort of reached out to me he

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,260
wanted to get together and do some stuff

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:25,339
so I guess what you're saying has a bit

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:28,490
of relevance um I I'm very vocal about

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,709
what I'm doing um but I don't think I'm

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:35,240
utilizing my network quite the way I

00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:39,070
should um so you went to flat iron and

00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,630
I'm thinking about I'm going to a

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,130
 cold school just just to check

00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:46,399
it out and see what I can get out of it

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,829
um what was your experience there I

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,899
don't know like I'm not planning on

00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:54,920
going to a boot camp where I have to

00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:57,019
physically attend because that's not

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,180
possible for me right now but I was

00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:03,709
wondering what your experience was at

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:05,029
flatiron yeah sure I'm before we talk

00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,709
about that do you mind if we touch on

00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:10,490
the network point that you made a moment

00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:12,470
ago yeah sure so I think what you said

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,510
is very very important because you said

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,670
that I have a network I'm growing a

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,410
network but I'm not necessarily

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,459
leveraging it right and I think that's

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,990
very different i think that having

00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,850
something is very different from using

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,100
it and i think the using it is something

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,959
that I personally am getting better at

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,149
as well because at this point with all

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,519
the speaking and all the tweeting that I

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:34,339
do I have a good amount of people on my

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,410
team but I'm not always purposeful about

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:39,620
asking for the right things in kind of

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,959
using that to you know to reach my goals

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,019
and so one thing that I've been working

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:47,540
on is being very direct about my asks

00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,970
you know if i say i want to speak at

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,380
this conference I'll find someone of my

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,269
network and say hey do you know someone

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,440
who's on the programming committee do

00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:56,000
you know someone who's on the selection

00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,399
committee can you put me in touch with

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,190
that person and so what I've been trying

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,230
to do is find the very specific asks and

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,260
telling people even if I don't have a

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,910
formula formulated ask like that telling

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,519
people what my goals are right my goals

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:15,589
for the next year are you know I'm going

00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:16,410
to build my podcasts and if I just say

00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:19,079
that

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,579
people if an opportunity arises where

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,810
they can help me they'll remember that

00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,730
and they'll come back to me a little bit

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,290
later so you know I think that being

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,899
very vocal is about building your

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,269
network knowing your network well enough

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,339
to know what to ask one to ask it and

00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:33,870
you know what to communicate to them is

00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:37,699
the leveraging part that I think we can

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:41,160
all get better at is that how you got to

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:43,949
co-host Ruby roques so would be rogues

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,480
was was very interesting I wrote as part

00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:47,850
of the the boot camp experience we were

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,019
obligated to write a blog post i think

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,629
it was every week i don't think i

00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,579
managed it quite that but the very first

00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:58,560
pot the very first blog post that I

00:15:53,579 --> 00:16:01,319
wrote was a reflection piece on a talk

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,439
that was given by james edward great one

00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:06,269
of the one of the ropes and i don't know

00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:07,829
exactly how he came across it but

00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:10,529
somehow he came across that blog post

00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:12,360
and he kind of started looking into my

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:14,399
blog and he saw the flat iron cartoon

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,379
that i drew and i think at that point

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,899
i'd already spoken at railsconf so he

00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:21,149
saw my rails com video and that kind of

00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,220
all led to hey you should you should

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,509
come on the show as a guest and I did

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,769
the guest thing and they really liked me

00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,990
and then they said okay let's try you

00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:29,790
out for like a three month I think we

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,459
called it jokingly the rogan residence

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,930
program and so I did that for three

00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,759
months at the end of the three months it

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,819
was hey you know we'd like to you know

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,250
to have you on as a regular panelist so

00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:42,779
that was you know it started with that

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,180
one blog post but i think it was

00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:47,490
accumulation of a lot of the activity

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,939
that i'd put online that led to the

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:58,769
interest and actually bringing me on

00:16:49,939 --> 00:17:01,459
that's interesting um yeah I I would

00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:05,760
like to do a lot more of that um I've

00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:07,199
sort of reached out to um Dave rail I

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,880
don't know if you know him he does the

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:16,230
developer on fire podcast um one of the

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,750
code newbies Alex Courtney um he was on

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:22,380
Dave rails developer am on fire podcast

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:25,949
when Alex was doing his own podcast he

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:29,470
had Dave rail on and so I asked Alex to

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:31,390
introduce me to Dave real and so

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,870
I just reached out today Braille and

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:38,440
hopefully um I can get to know him um so

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:41,020
I want to be on his show I want him to

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,390
come on my show but I want to sort of

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,419
develop a rapport with him um how

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,760
important do you think before you you

00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:50,440
get on someone show and before you had

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,720
them on your show or your blog whatever

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,090
how important do you think develop

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,580
developing rapport that person is I

00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,770
think it's so not important at all I

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,780
think that you develop the rapport by

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,549
having them on your show right what am i

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,130
when my I think best examples of this

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,360
was Korean I'm totally gonna but your

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,460
last names i'm not going to attempt it

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,370
but she is the executive director of

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,200
girl develop it and i had heard of her

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,820
before i'm a huge fan of girl develop at

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,520
huge fan of sarah chips and Vanessa

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:21,460
Hurst who co-founded it a few years ago

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,409
and I wanted her on the show to you know

00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,260
talk about GDI and talk about the work

00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:28,480
they were doing and what happened was

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,429
that in the hour that we talked that's

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,020
when I really got to know her right that

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:34,299
was you know instead of going out for

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,490
coffee or dinner or lunch that was our

00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,890
coffee dinner and lunch and I got to ask

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:42,309
very specific and very deep questions

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:44,020
about her work about her view on you

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,150
know women in tech and about the role

00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,610
girl develop it plays in that you know

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,760
in improving and in making tech a more

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:54,520
inclusive place and it was in that hour

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,590
that we publicly got to know each other

00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,990
and you know I learned a lot about her

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,789
but she also learned a lot about me what

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,919
was important to me from the types of

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,450
questions that I asked and that was the

00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:05,770
beginning of a very real friendship and

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,210
you know after that we started emailing

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,210
back and forth and she was the one

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,799
actually who who nominated me to be the

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,110
keynote speaker a telecom for a couple

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,780
weeks ago and so you know I think that

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:20,260
that interview is the coffee date that

00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,970
is the rapport building step one so yeah

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,190
I think that you should totally look at

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,809
that as this is my chance to really get

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:31,090
to know the person and ask the questions

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:35,110
I want to ask cool cool I want I kind of

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:38,500
interrupt long those lines a lot of the

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:41,049
content that code inspires produced came

00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,570
as there was a result of almost a cold

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:46,930
call uh reaching out someone

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:49,150
um you know we love having Serrano's i

00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:52,630
guess today but I you know I knew her

00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,040
because uh he invited her to speak at a

00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:59,650
secret conference that we're going to

00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:02,410
bill in January um but after that uh you

00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:06,100
know we we don't know each other well we

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,840
don't have a rapport but I like to have

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,510
her on get a great show out of it

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:15,700
because interesting people make for

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:19,060
interesting content and also that's how

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,460
kind of all the shows go and people are

00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,590
also willing to be on your show because

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:27,100
it's good for surrounded be on the show

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:29,170
to build you know her name and a group

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,500
of you know a couple thousand people

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,030
that know about codes to fly that might

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,860
not have done our name so i mean it's

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,870
it's a two-way street and there's a lot

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,750
of great relationships you can build

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:43,510
just based on trading something together

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,950
and that's kind of like open source in

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,930
general let's all build something

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,760
together and that's how we can get to

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:52,390
know each other through building these

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:55,630
cool things totally agree yep Emma you

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:59,320
ever yeah um I was just gonna say I mean

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,510
that's I I had a degree you know I got a

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:05,410
degree like Justin said information

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:07,810
science it fit but um I think that you

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,000
know and to perhaps to a lesser extent

00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,370
but it's all the same things about

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,460
making connections with people it's

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,050
really important I mean after it to be

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,310
completely honest with you after I got

00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:23,220
out of school I had no idea about

00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:25,720
getting a job I you know would apply to

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,340
like places I'd heard of and get no

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,050
calls or anything like that and I only

00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,650
ended up getting a job because I had

00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,940
been involved with another program that

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,010
you know I just heard about from some

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,930
other I had some friends who worked in

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:42,820
tech and I just sort of started hanging

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:44,320
out with them and they're hanging out

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,860
there they're friends for the most part

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,070
but you know like friend of a friend you

00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:56,100
know what every um and you know perhaps

00:21:51,070 --> 00:22:02,270
it's it's a little different that it's

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:04,230
it's yeah I guess it's sharing

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,679
experiences with other people or

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:13,620
whatever is really important into that I

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:15,570
mean I you know found out that found out

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:22,830
about the position that I ended up

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:25,799
getting out of college from another you

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:28,350
know from that project and from there I

00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:30,890
mean I moved to another job through

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:33,450
Godin supply and I wouldn't have known

00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,309
you know either of those things if had

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:39,539
gotten out there even as someone with a

00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:42,960
degree and even a lot of the stuff that

00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:45,179
I did at my first job I we didn't have

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,770
any the most her we didn't have anything

00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:51,659
about like Linux general usage or you

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,000
know sis administration and it's not in

00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:56,340
the track of school that I did and a lot

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,900
of that was also stuff that I picked up

00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,669
from other people we're working on other

00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,650
projects trying to just build something

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:08,940
with other people and so yeah I just

00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:10,890
wanted to say you really like that good

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:15,870
I don't know that even further and say

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:17,490
that a degree is good for maybe the

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,490
first job you get on job board

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,110
anonymously and like you don't like you

00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,929
have no clue what you're looking at and

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,440
you're just kind of applying to places

00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:32,610
um because then it lends credence on a

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:35,820
on a resume but uh you know after you've

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:38,580
made that or a few if you need to make

00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,650
that uh you know step to your foot in

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,630
the door somewhere after you've made it

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:46,909
everything you get going forward is

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:51,090
going to be based on connections and um

00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:52,650
who you know and if you use it if you go

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,400
get jobs through who you know you're

00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,100
going to end up in a lot better

00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,960
positions because you'll you'll have

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,059
like basically built in reviews to all

00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:04,140
these places instead of just going on a

00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:07,020
job board saying okay this looks good so

00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,290
I think that's about as good as a degree

00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:12,810
a regular agree can do yeah I mean I

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:16,290
I got the job at four moms basically by

00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:18,900
going to Pittsburgh Ruby events like

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,670
that's how I met Dan mark and that's

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,370
basically how I got the job and I think

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,810
I the first time I met mark the first

00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,540
event that I went to I actually met you

00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,550
Justin it was a like a buildable night

00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,620
but it was called something else back

00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:36,990
then or or you called it something hack

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:39,000
open hack open at um and I know I

00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,640
definitely think that's like that's my

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,930
advice to people that ask me that are

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,210
like coming out of school in there when

00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:48,450
they asked me like how do you how should

00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:53,940
i go about getting a job my answer is

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:56,730
always to uh join groups like meetup

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,140
groups and things like that and join

00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,100
communities and just start meeting

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,650
people and networking with people

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:05,310
because that to me is a way better way

00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:08,610
to further your career than to go to job

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:17,070
boards or use LinkedIn or anything like

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:22,070
that yeah go ahead Emma okay uh I just

00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:24,840
going to say um in at my first job

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:28,140
multiple and people made the comment to

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,790
me that uh that the only reason that I

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,310
got that job was because of these sort

00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:36,320
of like extra stuff that I did you know

00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:39,480
I was working on a small little um

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:43,770
project at the time in Pittsburgh with

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:46,290
some folks that I've since wept but um

00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,910
you know not only was that how I heard

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:50,520
about the job opportunity but also

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:53,010
that's how a lot of people said like you

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,870
know there wasn't really anything

00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,810
particularly interesting about my resume

00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:00,950
other than the fact that I was likely

00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,950
working on something with other people

00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,700
aside from just

00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,790
you

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:38,850
I don't say yeah aside from just school

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:41,520
and trying to get a job otherwise so

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,230
yeah I think those those side projects

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,390
are really important so the job that I

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,430
have right now a program manager rekha

00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,290
soft and I'm managing a new technical

00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,870
training program that we're doing called

00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:54,510
tech jobs Academy and it's a four month

00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:58,320
free program free to the participants 25

00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:00,180
people and it's targeting unemployed and

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,700
underemployed New Yorkers who make less

00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,430
than 50k so really trying to find these

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,650
alternate pathways to enter the tech

00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:10,350
industry and to get you know good jobs

00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,720
and to you know really launch different

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,210
tech careers and so the way that I've

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,250
been at this position for for for almost

00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:20,760
five months now and the way that I got

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,520
this position was I got an email from a

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,470
friend of mine who works at 18f and

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,240
emailed me and he said hey I got an

00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,850
email about this really great position

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,980
at microsoft it's basically what you're

00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,290
already doing for code newbie but you

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,090
can get paid to do it and I thought holy

00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,860
crap that's awesome and I said yes

00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,780

00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,490
you can do and so he put a you know a

00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:44,580
good word in and I interviewed about the

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,380
position and to me that was just such an

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,180
interesting moment where you know that

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,740
the friend of mine who'd heard about my

00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,630
work who knew what I was doing for

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,090
couldna be a new about the podcast and

00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:57,030
the community that we built in the past

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,440
almost two years he saw that and he made

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:01,950
that connection right so we talked about

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,780
you know doing your work and showing

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,600
what you're building in public like that

00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,880
was such a great moment to point to and

00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,500
say yes you know someone that I didn't

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,120
know was paying attention was totally

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,860
paying attention and thought of me for

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,200
this really amazing opportunity and it

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,500
was that that really got me the place i

00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,170
am now and that leads come up to a

00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,080
question that i had um I didn't know

00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:27,510
until today actually about what program

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,690
you were running it Microsoft and how

00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:33,060
similar it is to code nuit um do you

00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:38,490
want to talk a little bit more about you

00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:41,250
know how how it's uh being approached

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:44,460
I Microsoft and how it's different from

00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,410
code newbie yeah sure so I don't know if

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,290
we ever actually explain what code

00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,880
newbie was so let me do that real quick

00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,610
so you know cone to be started when i

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,160
graduated from the programming boot camp

00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,450
and you know i loved my boot camp

00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,740
experience tiffany sorry I never

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,290
actually officially answered your

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,140
question on that but overall it was a

00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,340
really good experience for me I think

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,440
that boot camp is one of those things

00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,330
where it's you have to be a certain type

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,580
of person to really take advantage of it

00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,580
otherwise can be very overwhelming it

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:17,460
can be just a lot to take in but for me

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,550
I'm I work best when I'm under pressure

00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,679
and there's always a deadline and I can

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,050
just kind of focus on one thing for you

00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,510
know 12 16 hours a day so for me it

00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:29,520
worked out really well but one of the

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,970
biggest things that I got from that

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,220
program wasn't the curriculum and the

00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,020
education and the teaching it was really

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,420
the community it was being able to sit

00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,670
next to you know 40 for other people and

00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:44,280
cry together when it didn't work and the

00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:47,940
high five when it finally made sense and

00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,830
it was that community that was so just

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,000
so crucial to my learning in my

00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,010
development it was something that was

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,660
very hard to get when I was spending the

00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,270
couple months learning to code on my own

00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:00,420
and so when I graduated I thought huh

00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:02,429
that community experience cost me you

00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,110
know eleven thousand dollars and six

00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:06,570
months total without a paycheck which is

00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,250
a pretty pretty big price tag for a

00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,770
community and I didn't really feel like

00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,780
there was any other way to find these

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:14,429
people to find these code movies all

00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,710
over the world who were going on this

00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:18,660
journey and so I decided to put on a

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,550
Twitter chat so we used the hashtag code

00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,860
newbie I tweeted it from my personal

00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,360
account and we did that for you know a

00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,370
few months and it really started

00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,510
catching on after a while I thought okay

00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,490
this needs to have its own Twitter

00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,020
account needs to have its own you know

00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,360
domain name it needs to just kind of be

00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,179
its own thing and we did the Twitter

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,890
chat for I think the first year and at

00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,660
that point I thought okay this is really

00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,730
you know people are really into it they

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,400
really like it let's let's do more stuff

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,440
what's other what other things we can do

00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,470
for these for these people who were

00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,990
going on this journey and so about over

00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,899
a year ago now I guess at this point we

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,719
decided to do

00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:57,759
podcast which was our way of you know

00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:59,589
finding very specific stories and

00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,509
getting a dig deep right it wasn't just

00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:03,729
the Twitter chat where it was a great

00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:05,950
launching off point of connecting people

00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:08,739
it was a moment just kind of pause and

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:10,659
dig into a single story and so we did

00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:12,700
that and then we launched the online

00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:14,200
forum where we could actually capture a

00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,899
lot of the resources and information

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,089
that we were sharing on Twitter and then

00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:21,190
we did the Kona be slack which took off

00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:24,009
way more than I thought it was going to

00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,869
and yet that was the place where in real

00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:28,869
time people can connect and help each

00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:30,879
other code and you know debug and really

00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:33,429
just provide an emotional support system

00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:35,529
for our community and so you know code

00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:37,749
new be more than anything is very much a

00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:40,179
community like we're not an education

00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:41,769
company where you know we are a group of

00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:44,109
people who really want to see each other

00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:47,049
succeed and we do that using a bunch of

00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:49,179
different tools and so what I do at tech

00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:51,789
jobs Academy at Microsoft is similar in

00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:54,279
spirit but that jobs Academy program is

00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:57,159
very much an educational you know

00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,960
program so it's four months of technical

00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,599
training we focus on cloud and server

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,179
administration and most of the program

00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:06,159
is technical but there's also a very big

00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:07,450
focus on career development so those

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,159
skills that you know Tiffany and I were

00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,659
talking about a little bit earlier where

00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:12,249
it's not just about having the skills

00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:14,109
it's about showing the skills like that

00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:16,089
definitely is going to happen in this

00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:17,649
program too so we're going to do you

00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:19,749
know even things as simple as how to

00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:22,389
send an effective email I get a lot of

00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:23,799
email and most of it is really bad so I

00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:26,559
really want to show the world how to

00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:29,080
write good emails and cover letters and

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:32,200
resumes and how to talk about your

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,119
skills you know one thing that either

00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,499
that's so true about the Kona be

00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,679
community and just about getting that

00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:41,229
first job is as Alex and Emma both said

00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:42,789
you don't really have a lot going for

00:32:41,229 --> 00:32:44,229
you at that point you don't have a lot

00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:46,509
of work experience if you're graduating

00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:48,339
from the same program your whole class

00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:50,109
has the exact same experience that you

00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:51,249
do because you graduated together so how

00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:53,499
do you stand out how do you

00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:55,450
differentiate yourself enough to get the

00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:58,779
attention of a recruiter of an HR person

00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:00,129
and so we work on those skills so it's

00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:02,349
very exciting it's a very different

00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:04,539
world you know a lot of my time is spent

00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:05,619
working very closely with our community

00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:06,310
college system because it's in

00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:07,960
partnership

00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,820
with our college system and with them

00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,040
the local that the new york city

00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,710
government and so a lot of it is spent

00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,290
on very long phone calls and meetings

00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:20,110
and legal documents and lots of Excel

00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:22,090
sheets last lots of Excel sheets but you

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,070
know to me it the most important part is

00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:25,540
you know when I get an email from one of

00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,920
our we're currently in the application

00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,540
process so I'll get an email from one of

00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,890
our applicants going I'm really studying

00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,230
really hard for the technical entrance

00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,250
exam and you know i just passed would

00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,990
thank you so much for you know

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,480
encouraging me like those moments are

00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,210
really what would just you know make the

00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,070
whole thing and so we are starting the

00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,020
program january four so i'll keep you

00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,760
all updated on how that goes but i'm

00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:48,040
really excited it's an opportunity to

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,660
you know serve a very specific group of

00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,670
people and get them you know very

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,710
specific technical training skills and

00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,450
you know and fighting for them and

00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,480
really getting to be their advocates and

00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:02,740
helping them get jobs so it almost seems

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,260
like uh code newbies could be a support

00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:09,370
need for programs just like what you're

00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:11,740
doing at microsoft have you seen um kind

00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:13,780
of sub communities of people in code

00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:18,160
newbies showing up from like flat iron

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:21,400
and uh from a code Academy and things

00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:24,310
like like like subcultures around

00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,320
certain programs yeah sort of so I know

00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,480
that we have we have a good amount of

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,400
free code camp people obviously have a

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,720
good number of campers in our community

00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,380
but I know that free code camp has their

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,430
own community as well we have

00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,080
railsbridge is another community that's

00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:40,510
very active on code maybe we actually

00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,860
created a thread just for railsbridge

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,600
questions it's one of our most popular

00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,300
threads and so we kind of get a lot from

00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,890
them and there was a short time when

00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,600
TIFF boot camp was a sponsor and so we

00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,680
get a lot of bootcamp people so once in

00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,440
a while like we'll see people kind of

00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,970
migrate over and enjoying enjoying our

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,650
group which has been a lot of fun you

00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,970
know it's great when you know because

00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,070
we're not you know we're not competing

00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,260
against the education company so we get

00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,420
to really be this you know do good feel

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,800
good community organization that's

00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,330
really just about the people and

00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,330
providing a support system for them

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:43,150
yeah oh sorry sorry someone else can

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:47,170
take it I'll put a note to pause okay do

00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:50,620
you have any have an implant to monetize

00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:52,090
being animation anyway yes oh we do

00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,580
right now right we have sponsorships on

00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:56,950
the podcast so we've thought of in the

00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:01,030
past year I thought about different ways

00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:04,270
to make it into an education type

00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,860
company but to me that doesn't meet just

00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:08,110
doesn't make any sense you know the I've

00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,410
tried a couple little ways of doing it

00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:13,420
I'm tried a couple prototypes and at the

00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,520
end of the day like what we are as a

00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,020
community and you can't really charge

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,310
people like you can't charge the

00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,920
community part of the community doesn't

00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:23,800
really make any sense so you know we do

00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,690
have what my goal is to do you know the

00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,840
podcast really well and to do a couple

00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,540
more media oriented shows where we can

00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,310
be sustainable from sponsorships but you

00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,050
know right now I don't see a plan for us

00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,610
ever you know charging our members to be

00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,430
part of our community that feels that

00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:41,500
feels icky what about a code maybe meet

00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:43,480
up oh we have a couple of those already

00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:48,820
so we all really you didn't know about

00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:50,620
that Tiffany no I know I did it you yeah

00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:53,380
we have a couple we have one in Philly

00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:56,080
that was our newest one we have one in

00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:59,350
Atlanta we have one in Austin we are

00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,990
planning on having a couple more I think

00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:05,800
we're planning Nashville Indianapolis

00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:08,140
Houston and maybe New York for the new

00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,340
year so yeah we've done we've done some

00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,890
meetups and the great thing is

00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,090
especially for Atlanta Kim Korean is the

00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,460
team leader there and she's absolutely

00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,440
amazing and when we were talking she

00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,750
said you know everybody here charges

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,180
everyone charges for a meetup and you

00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,910
know us being the you know one of the

00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,950
few totally free come over bring your

00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,369
laptop we're you know we're inclusive or

00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,650
welcoming

00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:31,180
really really nice meetups is very

00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,970
different for those environments so I'm

00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,799
really excited to take the Kona be brand

00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,269
and all the feelings and all the

00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:39,279
feel-good stuff that we do and to bring

00:37:37,269 --> 00:37:41,019
it to you know physical environments so

00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:43,930
yeah we've been doing them for the last

00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:47,170
three 3 four months now we're going to

00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:52,990
slowly roll out to different cities good

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:57,730
you um how do you kind of maintain that

00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:59,349
growth in a way that's in line with the

00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:02,950
principles that you've set up for code

00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:05,799
movie because i'm sure that creating a

00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,990
welcoming and quality event is really

00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:10,499
important for code navy to succeed so

00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:13,829
how do you manage that on the scale of

00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:15,999
growing to new cities and you know

00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:18,069
managing one in nashville whenever

00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:20,019
you're in new york city mmhmm yeah

00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:21,849
that's a great question up to me that's

00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:23,230
when the scariest part was exactly what

00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:25,210
you said you know we start every Twitter

00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,529
chat with our three rules which is you

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,240
know to be nice be supportive and be

00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:30,519
helpful and we mean it you know we will

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,109
you will talk to you sternly if you are

00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:35,289
not nice and helpful and supportive and

00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:38,200
so yeah that's been my biggest fear is

00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:39,789
as we grow how do you maintain that with

00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,130
the meetups it's been it's been awesome

00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:44,710
I mean we have the team leaders that we

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,880
have are absolutely amazing there you

00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,890
know the three of them they're very very

00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,599
strong people they've been part of the

00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,859
canoe be community for a long time they

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,390
really get it you know you know I don't

00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:54,430
have to explain the culture to them they

00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,569
totally understand it and one of the

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,359
things that I've done for all of them is

00:38:55,569 --> 00:39:00,489
I've flown down to to kick off the very

00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:02,170
first meetup and so you know in that way

00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:04,150
we get to meet in person which is

00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,069
awesome i love getting to you know meet

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,329
people it's great when i take their you

00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:10,210
know twitter avatar and they become real

00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:11,680
humans that's always fun and so yeah you

00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,809
get to meet them in person you get to

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,279
watch how they run the show you get to

00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,920
give you know feedback and advice and

00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:19,450
you know it's really just a lot of trust

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,999
with the team leaders who are running

00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:23,619
the show we have monthly meetings where

00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:26,109
we'll say you know were there any issues

00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:27,700
any problems that came up you know how

00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:28,779
can I support you and so we're very

00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,029
close and we have really good

00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:33,069
communication channels so the meetups to

00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:34,930
me honestly as long as you have a really

00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:36,759
great person who knows the culture who

00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,460
understands the rules and is not afraid

00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:41,180
to enforce them that's not a concern to

00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,650
me the bigger concern are the online

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,020
communities where I think it's a lot

00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:48,619
easier to get away with not being nice

00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:49,670
right and so slack to me is both one of

00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:52,790
the best things and one of those

00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:55,550
terrifying things I've done because flac

00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:58,430
is not meant to be a forum it's not it

00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:00,140
is meant to be an internal team tool for

00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,839
communication which is different right

00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,150
it's not there no moderators on slack

00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:07,309
there are no you know report you know

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,349
bullying a report spam like there's no

00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:11,000
reporting features built into slack and

00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:12,770
so one of the things that makes me

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,450
personally very very uncomfortable is

00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:16,880
the idea that someone will say something

00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:18,650
and we'll or you know do something or

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,210
post something that'll kind of ruin it

00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,680
for everyone and I won't know about it

00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,910
because if I know about it i can say

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,420
something that I'm not you know I'm not

00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:28,160
on slide 24 7 and the more connubii

00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,599
grows the more international it's become

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,359
and so there are people there literally

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,099
24 hours of the day and so you know

00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:36,740
that's something that I'm still you know

00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:39,470
figuring out luckily a lot of the people

00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,809
on there you know know me and the very

00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:44,180
few times it can think there's been one

00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:46,099
and a half times anything has happened

00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,390
at least to my knowledge they've told me

00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:49,130
and I've had like you know five people

00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,480
say hey this thing is going on you

00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,760
should probably check it out and I've no

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,930
shut it down it's been fine but that to

00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,849
me is the bigger risk you know when you

00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,980
go online it's so easy to slip something

00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:59,930
in that's offensive and it's not okay or

00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,210
you know to say something as a joke and

00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:05,530
it's not funny for everyone so that's

00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:11,329
the thing that we're still figuring out

00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:16,040
so aside from the you know media focused

00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:17,990
podcasts and growing to new cities how

00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:22,609
do you see could maybe growing over the

00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:24,500
next year 25 years oh man so there are

00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:26,829
so many things I want to do and the

00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,900
hardest part is focusing on one of them

00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:33,140
so they're a bunch of thing so one is

00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:37,160
probably the riskiest and the hardest I

00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:40,880
want to know what it would be like to

00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,049
have a physical space for code newbie so

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,940
right now you know couldn't v's a

00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:45,710
part-time thing for me it's you know my

00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:49,339
nights and weekends go completely to

00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,390
that project but you know I've heard do

00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:52,809
you all know about the tech higher

00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,809
initiative

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,900
no okay great I got to tell you all

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,470
about it so the tech higher initiative

00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:02,420
is the White House initiative that was

00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:05,330
announced think for 10 months ago i'm

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,600
not even a year ago and it is a national

00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:10,820
effort to retrain people and to get them

00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,070
into technical jobs you know tech jobs

00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,750
are high paying their secure their

00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:19,220
growing there's such a huge demand for

00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:22,160
it and so excuse me and so it's a really

00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:24,650
good opportunity to retrain folks that

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,160
you know are a dead-end jobs and to get

00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:30,500
them into this industry and so I was at

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,880
the type hire summit it was like two

00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,870
weeks ago now where they brought

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,070
together all these your policy makers

00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:39,830
educators you know community leaders

00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,120
different people in the industry to get

00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,470
them in a room and kind of discuss

00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,180
what's working what's not working and

00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,740
one of the ideas that I'd heard there

00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,650
which is very interesting was the idea

00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:50,390
of a rec center but a tech center so

00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,860
it's like a community center where you

00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,810
know there is traditionally basketballs

00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,360
and pool tables and you know maybe some

00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:58,340
classes but to put in a computer lab and

00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,870
to actually have learned code courses

00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,730
and support groups and that kind of

00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,460
thing and I thought oh that sounds

00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,530
really really neat and so I I want to

00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,990
think more about this idea of having a

00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,700
physical code to be space where it's

00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:11,930
almost like a co-working space where you

00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,830
can kind of come in and bring your

00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:17,450
laptop but it you know has programs and

00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:19,100
does you know workshops and tutorials

00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,780
and it's a place for people to come and

00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,220
create stuff together so that's one idea

00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,740
that I have that's more of a long-term

00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:28,880
thing the other thing is I really want

00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:30,590
to do more of the podcasting stuff so

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,480
you know there's a couple podcast ideas

00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:34,670
that I have that I'm that I'm currently

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,670
working on but I'd love to kind of see

00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,980
how far you can take this idea of

00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:41,660
crafting stories around technology and

00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,670
bringing them to the up to the public

00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,950
right now code movie is very much

00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:47,540
focused on people who have kind of

00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,580
already started on that journey right

00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,530
we're not taking you know non-believers

00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,730
and making them into believers you kind

00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,230
of already you're already sip in the

00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,900
cochise by the time you you know you

00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:58,340
engage with us and so I I want to toy

00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,320
with this idea of taking these

00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,560
narratives and these learn to code

00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,570
stories and see what you can do you know

00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,340
on a stage what do you do if you wanted

00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,140
to do a live

00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:10,690
show right what do you do if you want to

00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,670
do a video series and what happens when

00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:15,280
you gear it not just two people who are

00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:18,070
already coding but two people who might

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,870
be interested in it if only they knew so

00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:21,730
those are the two big things I'm

00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,730
thinking about is doing some type of a

00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:26,620
more live theater version more towards

00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,540
the public of the general public and

00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:30,670
this idea of having a physical coding

00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:35,260
space where people can come and learn

00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:38,380
and collaborate that sounds really

00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,550
interesting good that means a lot going

00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:43,240
on you because you've been part of the

00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:45,070
the team for a while yeah yeah I mean I

00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,400
i discovered your podcast i don't even

00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:51,070
know how um but i've listened to all of

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:55,480
them and they're really really great um

00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:59,350
I have a I wonder if you'd be willing to

00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,530
UM I know that the the people in the

00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:07,030
code newbie chat and forms are not you

00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:10,210
know name brands um but perhaps you

00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:13,180
could interview some of them that seem

00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:17,790
to have interesting stories I know you

00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:20,020
interviewed brian douglas um who is

00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:22,600
really really great he's really doing a

00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:26,080
lot of good things I mean he was part of

00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:30,610
the code new me community um and still

00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:33,010
is but not as heavily as he was um but I

00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:35,560
was wondering if you'd be interested in

00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:38,050
like doing a little exposé or

00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:43,300
interviewing someone from the chat

00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:46,750
directly that seems to UM speak to you

00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:49,800
as something that's or someone that's

00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:53,580
interesting and has a has a cool story

00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:58,420
you mean from the laguna beach at yeah

00:45:53,580 --> 00:46:01,780
yeah do you have someone in mind I don't

00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:05,770
have anyone in mind right now because I

00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:08,040
don't I mean I visit and I that's why I

00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:12,400
say I like to utilize communities more

00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:16,030
um I utilize it to get answers but I

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:20,080
haven't been there to just have

00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:23,080
community per se so I don't really know

00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:28,120
whole lot of people that have come to

00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:29,710
code newbies um just recently um so I'll

00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,590
get back to you on that I don't have

00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:34,150
anybody right now but yeah exactly what

00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,620
you said is the the balance that we're

00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:39,100
trying to strike right because I think

00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,690
that it's important to introduce people

00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,480
if they don't already know them to those

00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:45,310
brand names right those genres of the

00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,870
world as important for you all to kind

00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:48,940
of get to know who these really big

00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:51,010
names are in the community but i think

00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,630
it's just as important to focus on the

00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:55,210
actual code newbies right which is why

00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,860
we've had people like Amy Simmons from

00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:59,890
Australia who recently made her

00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:03,040
transition from journalism to code we

00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:04,870
have Latoya Allen who was I think she

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,690
did an apprenticeship which she did a

00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:09,400
great job talking about and you know

00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:11,080
we've had some other people we had Kate

00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,360
Donahue talking about how she got into

00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,850
MakerBot so we've had you know we've

00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,290
been trying to balance having these big

00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:20,200
name brands and people you should know

00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:22,210
with people who you know maybe didn't

00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:25,930
make a huge contribution to programming

00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:27,490
like writing jquery but they there are

00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:30,760
people you can connect with and to me

00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:34,060
one of the most thrilling and surprising

00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:37,210
things is when the code newbie story

00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:39,670
beats the the bigger story so when we

00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:42,310
did Courtney urban I don't know what in

00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:44,560
the world happened that week but we got

00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,690
a much bigger jump in downloads on that

00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,520
episode in the episode surrounding it

00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,020
and that was the one where she talked

00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,700
about being self-taught and it was

00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,680
called self-taught programmer and is

00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,480
about her talking about how she never

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,250
did a boot camp Tonetta CS degree I

00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,560
contra what she said he'd an undergrad

00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:02,710
but she basically spent the you know a

00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:05,260
year learning to code mostly on her own

00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:07,480
and that to me was just such a great win

00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,880
to see that that one be you know the the

00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,110
top name that we had right after that so

00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,880
yeah I totally agree i think that having

00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:16,170
that balance of different people in

00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:21,060
different voices is absolutely important

00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:24,070
um so we're getting low on time for our

00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:27,820
podcasts so I wanted to kind of maybe

00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:29,800
get one more question uh I know tiffany

00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,810
has some good ones lined up already and

00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:36,440
I was like her to choose like one of the

00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:38,330
one of the dire ones that you know you

00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,110
have sarong on the line and you want to

00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:46,220
ask make it good if and then we close

00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:49,640
the show out with that well I remember

00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:52,370
coming across your blog blog e tunes um

00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:56,050
and I was you're really really good

00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:59,110
artist and I was wondering how you see

00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:04,420
aren't intersecting with technology um

00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:04,420
when you're doing what you're doing oh

00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,900
man you save like the hard one for last

00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,000
okay so let me I'm gonna you know what

00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:17,600
I'm going to return that with a question

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:24,190
do you see podcasting as art uh yeah I

00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:29,090
do actually um and it's it's difficult

00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:36,920
to pull off well and um that that makes

00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:39,140
it in art form to me um I think that you

00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:42,800
do such a good job with it I mean you

00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:44,870
really your questions are really really

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,050
in depth and they're really meaningful

00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:51,490
um and you're such a good you have such

00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:56,330
a good voice in such a good way of

00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:59,180
asking questions that a lot of people

00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:01,670
don't have it and that's what makes it

00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:03,830
an art form when you can pull that kind

00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:07,160
of thing off with interviewing John Reza

00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:10,970
and um you know to the non main brands

00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:14,450
um you know that that's definitely art

00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:17,930
to me ah thanks Tiffany I'm so glad I

00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:20,690
asked you that question ok so back to

00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:23,420
your question of how does our kind of

00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:25,280
fit into coding so it's interesting when

00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,520
I asked other people this question they

00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,590
always say Oh it obviously fits it's you

00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,780
know it's all the same thing there's

00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:35,150
always the creative process encoding and

00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:38,180
I totally don't agree with that I'm

00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:39,800
sorry past podcast guests but yeah I

00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,020
don't see that at all i think they're

00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:45,380
very very different when I am thinking

00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,670
about you know a guest and the

00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,250
interviewing process

00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,770
I might the way I approach it is so

00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,480
different it's much more at this point

00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:55,880
you know because I was a journalist and

00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:59,540
I you know I've done and PR on a lot of

00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:02,570
interviewing type stuff before a lot of

00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,980
my interviewing is very instinctual at

00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:05,330
this point you know a lot of it is just

00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,790
kind of pulling from different things

00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:09,590
that I remember and you know I'm just

00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:12,290
going off my gut most of the time you

00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,940
know i do very little preparation for

00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,010
the podcast I look a couple things up

00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:19,100
maybe 10-15 minutes but and I have a

00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:20,480
general flow but a lot of times we we

00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:23,840
don't really end up following the flow

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,970
and so when I compare that process with

00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,460
how I code and I think this is because

00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,990
as a as a coder I'm still very new I

00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,690
have only been doing it for two years as

00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:34,820
a coder I have to work a lot harder and

00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,840
I have to have a process you know when I

00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,670
learned about behavior driven

00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,790
development that changed my world

00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:42,920
because I had a way of coding now like I

00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:46,160
had a formula i had steps that I could

00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:50,000
follow and to me coding takes so much

00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:54,710
more effort and thought and research and

00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,270
it's very steps driven where to me and

00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:58,190
in my experience of interviewing and

00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:00,800
even drawing I think to me is the same

00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:03,410
process where I'm going mostly off of my

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,180
feelings right I'll oh my goodness if

00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:07,280
you at some point maybe I'll do them

00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:11,300
I'll do a video of what it's like when I

00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,440
when I draw cartoons it's I look at

00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,630
something and I'll go it doesn't feel

00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:18,080
right it just doesn't feel right like it

00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:20,450
doesn't fendt so in the railsconf talk

00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,580
that i did the first its first time I

00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:25,010
did animation the first animation that I

00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,650
did was of me raising my eyebrows and

00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:31,220
like the creepy dude on the bus way and

00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:33,740
I spent so much time on those eyebrows

00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,840
an insane amount of time on those

00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:38,000
freaking eyebrows because every time I

00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,770
go that's not creepy enough I went too

00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,720
far and I just you know I was just

00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:43,880
really going off of the feeling that I

00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:47,270
had when I'm looking at it but when i'm

00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:49,160
coding i can't i'm not i don't think i'm

00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:51,770
at the point where i can rely on my gut

00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,720
i'm still thinking about okay I just you

00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:55,490
know that those that method is more than

00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,290
was it four lines long it's too long

00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:59,240
Sammy said I have to make it shorter you

00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,500
know I'm really relying on these rules

00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,850
and these things that I learned

00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:07,280
so for me the experience of creating of

00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:10,790
creating an artistic way is a lot easier

00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:13,820
and more feelings driven and coding is

00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:15,890
very much a process step driven thing

00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,720
where I'm relying on specific tools I

00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:23,210
can point to so there are very different

00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:25,850
experiences for me alright cool I think

00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:28,580
that eventually those methods to become

00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:30,080
the eyebrows and they do become oh it

00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,930
could be so much it could be so much

00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:36,580
creepier okay so much less pretty high

00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:39,410
ha I've you know spent that much time

00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:41,300
refactoring and oh it could be so much

00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:44,060
more service II or something like that

00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,710
mm-hmm that's what I was fired too and I

00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:48,740
like that I'm gonna if I get to that

00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:50,870
point I'm gonna name my next talk when

00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:57,100
