Starting a new job is hard, but what about starting a new job in a new country?

Some folks think that the culture of the country they were raised in, especially if it's a dominant culture like US, is easily understood and represented. They also often don't have the awareness of how even small differences can accumulate and cause a lot of stress for new immigrants - stress which can often be alleviated by answering a few questions and pointing them in the right direction.

Some immigrants think that the cost of moving to a new country should be solely on them and they put a brave face on when dealing with everyday frustrations. It can affect their mood and ability to be a great team member, and perform in their role the way they'd like to.

In this talk, I'm going to identify areas in which new immigrants on your team might need support from you and how to help them navigate those issues. If you'd like for your co-workers to bring their whole selves to work, helping them feel safe and supported is key, especially while they learn the culture of their new chosen country.

I'm also going to talk about my personal experience as a recent immigrant, that might be helpful for other folks dealing with that new reality. Naming problems and talking about my path can help them realize that it really is hard, there is no shame in asking for help!

she finally landed on the devops role

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,440
and loved it

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,799
she resides in vancouver british

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,000
columbia where she works on

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,080

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,560
watercolor

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,240
she's going to let you know how you can

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,439
support immigrant team members

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,160
take it away eliza hi

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,000
i'm anitzia and i'm going to talk today

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,399
about supporting your immigrant team

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,680
members i am an immigrant myself

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,480
i moved to canada a little bit

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
less than three years ago and i've been

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,320
in vancouver bc

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,840
ever since and i'm currently on my

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,640
second canadian job

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
i work in devops at clio which is a

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
canadian company that builds software

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,199
for lawyers

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,280
and i wanted to talk about this topic

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,920
because it's both my shared experience

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,399
being an immigrant and working through

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,559
that

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,840
and also my experience of people

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,400
supporting me through that

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
and helping me get to where i am and

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,040
thrive

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
and i think a lot of those strategies

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
and ideas might be useful for other

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,479
people as well

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,200
i would like to thank the organizers

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,479
i think there is the organizing work

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,600
that i should thank them for

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,000
first that often invisible work that

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,119
goes into making a conference happen

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,360
of getting the speakers and or

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,880
just like the timetables of everything

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,520
and putting in a website

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,000
and and getting folks interested and

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,799
wanting

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,439
to take part in it um and there's a lot

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,040
of that

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,200
and i know that because i sometimes

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,159
organize conferences too

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
um but maybe predominantly i think i

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,640
want to

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,240
thank them for organizing a conference

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
that's focusing

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,399
on building communities in tech and how

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,840
we communicate

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,560
because we rarely get dedicated spaces

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,799
for that

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,200
that are so big and focused

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
we we can get you know a site conference

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,399
track

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,399
maybe a presentation maybe a workshop

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,760
but having this bigger conversation

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:17,360
and having it be certain

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,000
center stage um it's what's important

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,599
for me

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,560
so thank you for doing that i would

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,480
also like to just point out that you

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,200
know i'm an immigrant and i'm a woman

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,599
and i work in tech and all of that makes

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,480
my

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,400
my experience helpful to understand

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,879
certain contexts and relevant

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
but there are many ways in which i am

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,319
privileged

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,760
so when you're thinking about supporting

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,400
your team members

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,239
try to understand where their situation

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,879
is and try to talk to

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,280
a more diverse group of people who have

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,280
lived through this experience

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,480
and maybe none of them have to be wise

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,239
and european

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,640
or cisgender or able-bodied

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,599
and have a pretty easy time coming to a

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,760
new country without

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,519
worrying about finding a job right away

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,080
so just keep that at the back of your

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,319
mind

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,319
that when i talk about it and mostly

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,519
talk about my own experience

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,440
and it would be great if you just

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,879
reached out to other people or educated

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,840
yourself more on other people's

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,400
experiences

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,760
i'm going to be talking about what

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,280
immigration is

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,400
why do people migrate what it is like to

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,000
be an immigrant

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,440
in a new country and maybe some

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
strategies that

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,959
you could use if you're an immigrant um

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,959
to

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,200
try and find a place for yourself to

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,200
thrive and i'm also going to talk about

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,040
some strategies that

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,519
if you are a team member of an immigrant

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,560
you could think about using them to to

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599
support them and

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,200
and to have a stronger connection if any

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,239
of those topics

00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,799
makes you uncomfortable please make sure

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:03,360
um you you're only watching this talk

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,560
if if it doesn't make you too

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,439
uncomfortable

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
and if it does just feel free to drop

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,200
off

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,599
i i won't mind i want you to be here

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,319
um in a place that lets you learn and

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,880
explore this

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,400
topic and not be stressed about it or

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,880
worry about anything triggering

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,880
happening

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,280
and i think the main thing i would like

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,520
you to take away from this presentation

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,160
is curiosity

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,919
so curiosity is something that helps us

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,960
connect as humans in general

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,440
no matter what situations we meet and

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,040
how we interact with each other um and

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,720
even if you don't know what to do

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
or you've never done it before or you're

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,800
not sure what someone's going through

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,000
being curious and being there for them

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,120
is going to help

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
a lot more than knowing all those things

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,080
so if nothing else try to be curious

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,080
about their experience

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,960
so what is immigration why do people do

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,759
it

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,360
um immigration is moving um to a

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,800
different country

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,120
and essentially it's any move

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,360
it's not only you know people moving for

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,440
work or people moving for education

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,840
it's it's anyone moving somewhere for a

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,759
few years and and switching cultures and

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,600
switching to context

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,240
and immigration is especially

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,759
visible in canada and in the united

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,280
states because there are a lot of people

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,759
who are migrants here

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,039
if you look at canada there's ovens over

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,880
seven and a half million

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,560
of us and about 22 of the society is

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,520
first generation immigrants

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,520
and about 18 is second generation

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,160
whereas in the us

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,280
the percentages might be smaller but the

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,520
number of people is

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,120
way higher it's about 40 million people

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,000
in the us who are first generation

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,759
immigrants

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,039
that's a lot of people and that means

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
you probably

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,240
are encountering some of them day-to-day

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
um

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
and some of them might be your teammates

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,120
or they might just be

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
people you meet in various situations

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,120
and

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,160
it's not it's not a bad thing to notice

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,759
that they're

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,520
slightly different when it comes to the

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,840
culture or

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,199
the way they communicate um it's

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,680
perfectly natural to

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,000
see that someone is an immigrant um and

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,680
maybe try to understand their experience

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,280
and we as north americans the

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
new immigrants and the established

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,720
immigrants and the few generations

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,639
in immigrants are

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,919
sharing the experience of trying to

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,440
understand our characters and

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,479
interacting with each other on a daily

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,520
basis

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,000
there's definitely a lot of us here and

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
it's

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,440
it's something that impacts a lot of

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,199
people in the society and that's why i

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,800
think it's important

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,720
um there is often a lot of conversations

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,960
around why people migrate

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,160
and a lot of them focus on you know the

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,080
opportunities the

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,160
making more money to having a better

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,960
life and yeah fair that's that's

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,039
important like

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,000
a lot of people migrate because of that

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,160
but try to remember

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
that some people migrate because of

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,919
safety they're

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,800
not safe in the country or the situation

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,440
they're in

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,280
maybe they're facing persecution maybe

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,160
they're economical issues or climate

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
change issues

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
that they have to move away from maybe

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,880
some of them are here for opportunities

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,000
not for themselves but for the children

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,599
or other family members um and some of

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
them like me are just here because

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,440
they're curious

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,120
um there was really no reason why i

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,800
moved to canada other than my partner

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,599
being here and it was

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,039
my choice that i made from a very

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,240
comfortable place i could have just

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,960
stayed in poland

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,400
and i think my life would be great too

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,720
so it's not always

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,319
about moving to somewhere that's better

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,599
and also that better

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,440
is not always defined simply by work or

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,919
opportunities or making more money there

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,400
are

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,840
various reasons why people move um so

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,120
try not to assume you know why they did

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,639
it um

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,199
and it's hard i

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,479
have a lot to say about it so i'm going

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,800
to try and be brief

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,639
because we really want to focus on some

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,080
solutions here and not just

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,240
saying how hard it is to do it um

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,520
but keep that in mind it's it's

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,000
switching cultures

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,840
it's it's going somewhere that you don't

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,199
have an established relationship with a

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,240
lot of people you don't have a lot of

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,280
work history

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,000
you know in many ways that's freeing um

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,120
but at the same time it puts that much

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,919
more work

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,880
on you to to just have the daily

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,440
interactions

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,120
that you're used to that were maybe so

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
much easier in the culture that you are

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,159
coming from

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,560
um and often you have to do it in a

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,720
different language and with people who

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,640
notice that you look differently or you

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,240
speak differently or there are so many

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,920
things about you that

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,080
they noticed that wouldn't have been

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,839
something you have to think about

00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,120
in your previous context so it's hard

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,480
and it's hard in different ways and

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,120
different levels

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,040
on anyone who's experiencing it but

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,959
nevertheless don't assume

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,240
that oh it's easier because this person

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,320
is this and that

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,680
or it's harder for that person because

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
of something else

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,279
um just try to see the person and not

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,000
the system

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,680
and get curious about why it might be

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,640
particularly hard or maybe easier for

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,399
them

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,800
um and just keep in mind it's

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,360
still hard no matter if it's easy or not

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:36,640
it's it's still a hard thing to do

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,080
um the process is um very stressful and

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,720
transactional

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,320
you have to prove that you deserve to be

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
in your new country and in different

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,040
countries

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,399
um it's a different cost and a different

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,440
process but

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,360
in general countries want

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,560
immigrants that are going to benefit

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,600
them and the culture of the economy

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,640
um in many ways and this process is

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,240
for us to prove that we deserve to be

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,560
part of this new culture and

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,760
we're not going to be a burden for the

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,200
new culture

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,120
um one of the reasons you can be

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
rejected in the immigration process is

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,240
because

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,959
you have medical issues and the country

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,959
that

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,560
is accepting you decides oh we don't

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,399
want to bear that cost that's too

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,920
high so we're not going to accept you in

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,680
our country um

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,279
and that's heartbreaking right because

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,320
you can't actually control that

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,440
in many cases so we're going through a

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,560
process in which

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,040
we have to document improve our skills

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,839
our background our abilities why we want

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,160
to do it

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,720
that we know we can support ourselves

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,200
that we deserve to be here

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,399
and that in itself is sometimes very

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,399
dehumanizing

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,200
even though at the end of the day it's

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,279
humans who make those decisions for us

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,000
um secondly it's very visibly

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,959
impacting your well-being like this is

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,760
my heart rate

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,959
sorry this is my heart rate for the

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,360
first year

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,360
of my immigration journey

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
first when i was considering moving and

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,880
then i decided and i had to tell it to

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,240
my family

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,320
and i was preparing and then they

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,560
actually moved and

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,640
it was very hard at first and the

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,959
concept sort of got easier

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,160
i was like oh maybe i will never get a

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,959
job and i'll just stay

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,839
home forever and it got stressful again

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,959
because

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,320
i'm not the kind of person who can live

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,000
without a job um and it's

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,839
it's visibly it was a physically

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,959
impacting my mood and my interactions

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,680
with my partner

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,200
and just in general it was physically

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,440
hard on my body

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,959
it's not just something that's maybe

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,000
stressful mentally hard

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,200
it that stress actually has impact on

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,320
your actual health

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,760
so remember that any change

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,240
can cause stress like this and

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,440
immigration is no different

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,480
um the process of immigration um

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,760
is initially you might be very excited

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,200
and very happy

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,279
and and you go and on that ride and you

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,279
move somewhere and then you start

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,120
experiencing things you didn't expect

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,440
and then it gets harder

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,920
and then you sort of get annoyed and

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,760
angry and frustrated at the same time

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,040
and it can go either way you can either

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,800
break through that

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,560
and then find a way to be happy in your

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,360
country and find a way to be thriving

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,120
there

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,040
or um in some cases it can just stay

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,800
like that forever or get worse and then

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,079
some people decide to move back to where

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,240
they came from

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,480
so you definitely want your team members

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,160
to be on that first progression you want

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,079
to even if they're frustrated

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,320
even if if it's hard for them in the

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,839
moment you want to help them get

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,600
to that happy place where they can

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,160
thrive and

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,880
support other team members and just be

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,720
themselves

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,959
at work and be productive um

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,639
so even when you settle in those

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,519
challenges just keep coming

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,560
right um you have that bank slater first

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,440
which is great

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,680
because yay freedom i don't have any bad

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,680
history here i can just be myself

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,320
but then being yourself comes with a lot

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,880
of cost of proving who you are

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,480
and then not understanding why people

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,040
don't see it or they see certain things

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,000
about you that you don't think are true

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,760
and just constantly struggling with that

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,399
um so that blank slate is kind of a

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,120
double-edged

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,760
sword it's great but it's also very hard

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,279
to establish yourself in a new country

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,399
um and then even when you're

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,839
establishing yourself when you're

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,360
learning those things there are culture

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,160
shocks coming

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,600
and in my experience they're not ending

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,639
i still find things that

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,440
are shocking for me in canada um

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,839
and i i've kind of accepted by now that

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,360
they're

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,279
never going to end and there's always

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,480
going to be something

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,560
um even when i left here and i read

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,639
books and i've seen movies

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
even even after a few years of being

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,839
here

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,079
there are still things in canada that

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,519
shock me from time to time

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,399
and then you never kind

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,240
never really stop being homesick um and

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,600
it can get more intense

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,120
so you know you miss your family you

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
miss your friends you miss things you

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
like but then you

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,519
might start missing things you never

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,040
thought you would like like i said a

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,440
missing folk culture

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,240
and i started buying folk polish things

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,519
that i would never buy living in poland

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,240
but now they're in my house just because

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,120
that

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,519
brings me closer to my culture but then

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,360
even if i go back to my culture

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:38,160
if i visit my family i'm an outsider

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,920
and that has been a shocking experience

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,920
for me because all these little changes

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,160
that are accumulating in this process

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,079
you don't really see them day to day and

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,079
suddenly you go visit

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,839
and a person in the store looks at you

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,519
weird because you keep smiling at them

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,600
and asking how are they doing

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
which is not something you do in poland

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,399
in a store

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,079
um so there's some things you can do to

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,320
to work through that some things i've

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,639
done um that helped me and i

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,160
also know other immigrants that have

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,600
went through that

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,600
um first of all

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,680
you have to kind of embrace the change

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,600
and i'm not saying like

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,040
you always have to be happy about it and

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,040
you have to keep positive

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,079
there are going to be better days and

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,920
worse days

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,600
um but it's more about accepting that

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,160
this is just going to be the state it's

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,000
in

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,440
i don't know maybe it ends after 20

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,560
years of being in a country i haven't

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,639
done that yet

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,680
um but i would assume that for the time

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,920
being like those

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,759
issues you're you're experiencing are

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,240
just going to be your left experience

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,040
and finding strategies to work around

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,240
them or

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,160
maybe work through them and embrace them

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,360
are going to be much more impactful in a

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,720
positive way than

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,759
you know fighting against them and

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,360
trying to change things there are

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,320
certain things you can't change about a

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,040
culture like

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800
i cannot change the fact that the tax is

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,759
not included in price here

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,040
no matter how much i miss that and how

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,959
much it rotates me to

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,079
do that mental math every time i pray

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,519
for something

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,199
that's something i can't change and i

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360
have to accept that

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,120
um secondly try to build up your

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,399
confidence like you've done something

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,199
super hard

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,920
you have moved countries um you've met

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,279
cultures

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,440
you you see things that other people

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,920
don't see because they irritate you but

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,240
also because they're interesting and new

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,440
um it's it's something that a lot of

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,639
people around you haven't done like

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,639
they've done similar things

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,199
definitely they've challenged themselves

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,600
but maybe not always to that extent

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,800
um you can prove you can learn things

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,360
because

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,880
what's harder than moving countries

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,639
working in new language and the new

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,160
culture and struggling with that every

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,639
day and having to learn

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,800
how to communicate and and how to do

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,880
your job in the middle of all of that

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,240
on top of all that you have to also be a

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,560
professional that performs in the job

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,639
and just notice how much you're changing

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,440
and that you have done a lot of hard

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,880
things

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,480
one of them is figuring out the

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,560
immigration system which is

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,839
absolutely awful i think in any country

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,919
but especially so and in the us as far

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,079
as i know from my friends

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,439
so try to remember that you've done

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,600
something amazing

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,199
and you're great and just build that

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,360
confidence because

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,559
immigration is a great thing for your

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,039
growth and

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,919
you've done a lot um and don't let

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,360
anyone i'll

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,360
tell you otherwise um

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,960
then to get that strength and get that

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,919
confidence try to find spaces for

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,919
yourself

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,320
spaces that have to do with your culture

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,720
like friends who speak your language or

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,400
food that tastes like food at home

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,200
trying to find a space for your personal

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,480
goals when

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,720
you can work on something that has

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
nothing to do with being an immigrant or

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
being in this new culture or anything

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,360
around

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,880
growing that just growing your own

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,919
interests and your own skills for

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,880
yourself

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,640
and having that core you that's maybe

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,919
neither of the cultures of both of them

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,760
at the same time

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,039
and also try to find spaces in the new

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,200
culture that will

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,799
allow you to explore and ask questions

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,520
in a safe way and also

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,960
start understanding some of those tricky

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,679
cultural differences that you are facing

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,320
um but never forget to cultivate your

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,360
quirks

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,960
never forget those little things that

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,160
you know maybe come from your culture or

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,520
your family that make you

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,160
you like not wearing shoes in the house

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,240
is the thing

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,679
that i always do i talk a lot about air

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,640
pressure because that's what polish

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,679
people do

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,080
or i just did diminutives of

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,919
any word um and if i don't have them in

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,039
english i would switch to polish because

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,799
i just communicate in that way a lot um

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,280
those little quirks help you center

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,880
yourself in like being you and what's

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,400
you and you get to choose

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,679
which ones you keep and which ones you

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,960
change and which ones you accept from

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,960
the new culture

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,320
and it's for you to define your identity

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
and for you to decide what you want to

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,400
keep

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,919
and what you want to change um be ready

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,960
to make mistakes

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,520
um you're going to make mistakes and i

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,360
think

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,559
it's important to learn how to recover

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,039
from them more so than

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,880
avoid making them um if you're just

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,360
embarrassed and you said something silly

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
try to just you know make it quick and

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,919
sweet

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,960
just say oh that was not what i meant

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,760
that was silly

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,880
haha move on um they're embarrassing

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,280
they're uncomfortable

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,320
but they're going to happen a lot like i

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,120
mispronounce things

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,480
all the time if it's something that you

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,200
thought you understood but you actually

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,080
didn't

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,640
and it comes from a point of ignorance

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,480
which means

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,919
you just don't know as much as you knew

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,039
about something just

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,280
embrace that say i don't know ask people

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,039
for help and learn it um that's going to

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,440
help you grow much more than explaining

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,799
oh

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,880
you know i don't know because i'm from

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,520
this culture and it's just

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,200
it makes that conversation harder um and

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,679
then thirdly there are situations in

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,039
which

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,919
maybe it's different your culture and

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,559
then the country came to

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,320
when you wronged someone there's this

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,000
urge to explain why you did that and why

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,400
you misunderstood and

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,440
i would just say yeah people know that

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,360
they know you're from a different

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,840
culture but also

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,080
there is an impact that your actions had

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,720
and it's more important to address that

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,000
than to focus on discussing the culture

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,200
differences so

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,559
you know try to make mistakes and

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,520
iterate

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,080
and not get hung up on them because that

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,640
will

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,520
just maybe grow that frustration or keep

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,159
you

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,080
from embracing the new culture and the

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,679
situation you're in

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,159
and lastly you are empowered

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,919
to set expectations for your teammates

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,600
um and just do that clearly

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,880
like preferably as as early as possible

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,120
talk to them about the way you want to

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,840
communicate maybe some boundaries you

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
have

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,960
especially ones that they might not

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,360
expect um

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,280
and just just tell them this is what you

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,120
expect and and you give them space to

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,600
learn as they are giving you space to

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,799
learn

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,720
this new culture um and try to just

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,080
make this relationship work over time

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,960
and help them understand

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,679
what you mean you can expect things from

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,280
them too

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,840
it's not only about you adjusting to the

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,559
new culture and yes they can expect

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,640
things from you

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,799
and some of them are going to be people

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,440
specific not culture specific so try to

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,039
have that relationship defined early on

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,760
and make sure that you're communicating

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:25,120
clearly around those boundaries

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,720
so speaking of your teammates

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,799
if you grew up in a culture it's the way

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,960
of life of

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,080
of the group of people that you grew up

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,679
with right

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,200
it's very hard to see outside of that

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,840
culture and i mean that's any culture

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,440
like

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,600
it was very hard for me to see outside

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,039
of the polish culture it's not about

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,200
being from a particular country it's

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,159
more about we as humans

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,200
grow up in cultures so when you grow up

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,280
in a culture

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,240
there are three main areas in which that

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,600
culture

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,520
is visible there's a language either

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,600
a particular language or maybe an accent

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,640
or maybe some specific grammar forms

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,559
you're using

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,679
there's the social system in which you

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,919
grow up and you kind of

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,840
assume this is the default for solving

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,159
these kinds of social issues

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,919
and then there are the customs and norms

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,520
which is you know expecting certain

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,400
behaviors in specific cons

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,400
context so let me give you a few brief

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,679
examples of how i experienced that as an

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,440
immigrant

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,159
um language is often a very interesting

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,240
point of

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,919
communication for me with other people

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,880
because my accent is kind of

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,280
non-descript

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,720
and their instinct is to try to figure

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,400
out where i'm from

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,559
which i think most of the time is a

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,760
positive thing but sometimes it kind of

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,880
places me in some sort of

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,320
hierarchy that they think of

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,720
when they think of different countries

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,200
and different cultures especially so in

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,000
europe

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,960
because in europe people have more

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,280
prejudice

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,320
about polish people and how we are like

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,440
specifically

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,000
less so in canada and the us um

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,120
and i i wouldn't say that is a bad

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,360
intention

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,720
but that has a measurable impact on how

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,159
i communicate with people and how they

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,960
see me

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,720
so when you notice yourself doing that

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,440
just be aware of it i think is the most

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,000
important thing

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,840
even if you can't like you can't fix

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,440
noticing things like it's not a thing to

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,880
fix you just need to

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,120
embrace the fact that you've noticed

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,360
them and then try not to

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,400
necessarily act on them right remind

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,640
yourself that

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,320
you make grammar mistakes too and that

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,679
english is a very hard language

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,840
and it's very different in different

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,720
countries just be ready to answer

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,880
questions

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,760
to ask questions if you misunderstood

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,400
someone

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,039
be open to the fact that language is a

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,520
frame

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,760
that you have that for someone else is a

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,480
frame that they have to grow into

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,200
and it's always going to have some

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
problems

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,760
and just being open to questions and

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,440
providing resources for people to learn

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,520
like my team provides it for me and the

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,400
group chat where i ask questions all the

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,679
time

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,080
is going to help them grow um

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,279
the other thing i mentioned is the

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,279
social system

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,720
for me the biggest example of that is

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,720
the work environment

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,159
in poland what's considered work

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,799
environment is much

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,080
more specific it's a full-time

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,600
employment contract

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,279
it has a certain assumption about

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,000
vacation days

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,400
time and whatnot and it's by law so it's

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
not

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,840
employer specific it is very much

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,360
defined

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,919
in in law and that was a very different

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,760
frame

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,120
for when i came to canada and i first

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,840
encountered

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,320
the different contracts we have around

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,679
work

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,919
here and that's for any system

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,880
like any system at the very beginning

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,640
might seem

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,159
very hard because you don't really know

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,000
the rules of the system and you need to

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,840
gather a lot of information

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,679
so to help your team members work

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,720
through that um

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,720
just try to figure out apps there that

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,840
you're not noticing noticing anymore

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,520
because you've been doing them for a

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,679
while like you know how work contract

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,720
works because you've been working

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,400
you know how to get to uh you know a

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,400
medical center and get help

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,240
because you've done that but someone has

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,200
knew doesn't necessarily know it and

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,880
it's not

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,720
the way you do it in your culture is not

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,880
necessarily obvious so try to help them

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,320
build that ladder to get started on that

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,400
task

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,679
um and then i know the social norms in

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,200
canada

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,159
and i also know the social norms in

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,360
poland and the fact that i know them

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,720
um is sometimes not helpful because they

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,320
might be conflicting there are different

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,840
ways of reacting to things in poland and

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,120
they're in canada

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,559
um so as simple as how are you in canada

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,720
we kind of expect

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,080
an answer that's you know nondescript

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,679
and it's kind of a greeting but in

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,600
poland that implies you're actually

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,880
curious how someone feels and you're in

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,840
for an answer

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,960
so remember that whenever you ask me a

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,919
question like that like

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,520
i might know the proper canadian form or

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,760
american form

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,200
but i'm also coming from a culture that

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,840
has a different approach to it

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
and sometimes i'll just mix them up or

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,039
forget

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,840
or one of them will take over and even

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,880
if i

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,559
logically know something i've left way

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,320
more through the polish experience of

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,159
that and that's my instinct

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,159
when reacting to things um so

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,360
you know keeping in mind that if someone

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,520
crosses norm that

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,720
hurts someone else that's the most

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,080
important thing that's happening in the

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
moment so try to

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,200
you know not use that as an excuse for a

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,520
behavior

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,279
that's just unacceptable but if it

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,760
hasn't crossed online

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,320
um just try to be curious like what's

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,520
happening there is a cultural difference

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,720
is it a language issue um do they intend

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,840
to do something else

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,679
do they blurt out something weird uh

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,440
a lot of things can happen and sometimes

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,840
it's just wiring

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,360
in my brain works differently in a given

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,480
day and i say something stupid and i'm

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,799
like oh

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,120
right that was not the canadian thing to

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,880
say and then i tell everyone on my team

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,559
i'm having a polish day i'm sorry i

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,440
can't think in canadian today and it's

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,480
fine

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,279
those days happen um so what are some

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,080
other things you can try and do

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,279
i think the first thing is to find a

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,480
curiosity lens

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:17,120
so try to find an experience that's

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,320
similar to what your team members are

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,039
going through

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,399
um like moving cities changing schools

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,799
switching jobs

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,240
um and just remember how you felt in

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,279
that situation

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,679
and use it as a way to to understand

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,960
their

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,200
experience by at the same time not

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,240
belittling it and saying oh you know i

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,279
know how that works

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,640
i moved schools or that's not what we're

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,320
looking for here just

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,840
just try to use it as a starting point

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,520
for a conversation and say oh i don't

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,880
actually understand like i had a similar

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,679
experience but i think yours is

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,039
different

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,880
but if we find some ways they are

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,320
similar it's going to help me

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,120
empathize more and understand what

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,159
you're going through secondly

00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:01,279
take a holistic view i know

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,000
you want to help your teammates just

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,080
remember that

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,399
there's balancing and everyone is

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,240
balancing learning and safety

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,919
yes they want to learn and they want to

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,919
degrade in this new culture and

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,440
support the team but there's only so

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,600
much learning they can take at the same

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,440
time and if you

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,440
if you make this balance um unstable

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
it can just have a negative impact on

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,880
the life so

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,480
remember they're probably also facing

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,080
other things outside of work or maybe at

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,679
work with other teammates

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,840
and there's only so much they can take

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,399
so try to to make this relationship

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,760
work long term and work through small

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,919
changes rather than

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,360
piling everything up because then this

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,880
balance just topples over

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,880
and it makes it way more stressful

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,320
try to spark genuine curiosity so i

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,559
don't mean like

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,559
good to your teammates have a list of

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,080
questions and ask them like oh i want to

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,520
learn this and this and that thing about

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,200
your country

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,520
because while you might be genuinely

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,399
curious that might not come off as such

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,240
to them

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,840
try to find the moments in which they

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,720
are opening up their culture and their

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,559
ideas to you

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,799
like they're cooking something and you

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,360
you're learning a new dish from them or

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,799
you know they're celebrating holiday or

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,320
they used an emoji and you don't

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,799
understand what they meant try to

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,320
pick those moments and understand what

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,000
it was about because sometimes it's not

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,159
about their culture at all like

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,440
i don't only cook polish food i cook a

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,120
lot of different food

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,960
so it's not necessarily about me being

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,760
polish or being an immigrant

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,120
um so try to just get curious and ask

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,919
them questions and understand where

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,480
they're coming from

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,240
and what they're up to and again build

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,520
that over time don't

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,640
don't pile it out because um that might

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,840
make for a very uncomfortable

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,840
conversation for everyone involved

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,159
know yourself in the situation know what

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,360
you are comfortable with

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,640
and which hard topics you're ready to

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,480
talk about

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,559
there are topics that come up on my team

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,880
that not everyone wants to chat about

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,039
that i usually ask when i was when i

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,000
needed someone to help me with figuring

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,480
out medical help um i asked if there's

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,919
anyone

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,279
who wants to do that and is comfortable

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,200
with doing that because that's a topic

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,360
not everyone wants to talk about

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,360
um so try to figure out what you're

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,880
comfortable with and communicate that

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,720
and also if you change your mind that's

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,279
also fine just communicate that you

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,279
changed your mind

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,039
and remember about the context you have

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,960
this conversation in

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,799
so if it's a hard topic

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,559
for you it might be for your teammates

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,840
as well so maybe a better way of talking

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,919
about it is on a

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,880
video call rather than a group chat with

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,320
everyone there

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
and also remember that something might

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,399
be hard for you in the other culture

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,559
might be very easy to like it's very

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,000
easy for me to talk about money

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,600
which is not necessarily a polish thing

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,520
it's more of a me thing

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,360
um and i find it very hard sometimes to

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,760
remember that maybe that's not a topic

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,159
everyone wants to talk about

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,840
um you also need to be ready to make

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,080
mistakes

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,840
and i would say the mistakes you might

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,760
be making in this relationship are the

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,640
reverse of of the mistakes i was talking

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,039
about when

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,480
speaking about an immigrant experience

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,519
so um

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,120
you're always going to have some

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,919
prejudice and sometimes you're going to

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,760
act on it

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,679
and that's fine like you're going to

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,960
make those mistakes you can't

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,720
escape them but try to recognize

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,559
when that happens when you're

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,679
generalizing like you're saying all

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,279
polish people

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,440
do this thing because this one polish

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,840
person i know that's the thing

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,120
are you assuming oh this person knew

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,080
what they were doing and it did it on

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,600
purpose

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,960
when they actually just did something

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,440
because they didn't understand what the

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,360
custom

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,519
is and they were lost and they were

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,440
trying to figure out the situation

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,600
or when they don't understand you and

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,480
don't do something when you thought they

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,000
would do it

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,679
not because they didn't mean to

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,600
understand you didn't want to help you

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,320
because they just misunderstood what you

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,120
meant maybe you were very vague maybe

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,919
you said something as a question and you

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,240
actually

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,799
meant it as something they need to do

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,039
which happens to me a lot um sometimes i

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,880
need to ask is that a suggestion

00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,279
or do you actually want me to do that

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,720
because if it's not

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,480
something i have to do i might do

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,919
something else because i make decisions

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,640
on how i work

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,840
so try to be clear and just stop

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,120
yourself

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,399
before reacting and try to find a lens

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,880
through it makes sense

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,679
that they had the right intentions and

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,519
then

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,760
there was some sort of misalignment in

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,880
communication

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,080
and lastly learn from other sources and

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,000
other stories

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,679
as i said at the beginning of this talk

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,440
i am

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,120
a very specific person with a very

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,240
specific experience

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,440
and this talk might not click for you

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,279
and there might be something else that

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,760
clicks for you like working your

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,279
communication skills in general because

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,279
communicating with any team member is

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,519
about your communication skills

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,360
listening to other immigrants um looking

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,080
at data talking to experts there's so

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,200
many ways

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,159
that you can engage with this topic um

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,679
so try to engage in different ways if

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,799
the stock worked for you or it didn't

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,440
work for you

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,279
just try to figure out better ways you

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,159
can get informed and keep yourself

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,519
informed

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,159
and just remember to spark curiosity

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,519
um whatever you're doing to to make it

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,799
better

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,760
um and i think

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,880
by now you see that this talk was more

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,679
about

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,880
supporting your team members any team

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,279
members

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,919
um new team members team members you

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,760
maybe

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,240
didn't have the best relationship with

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,720
someone that you had a conflict with

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,559
just anyone on your team and the

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,360
immigration lens here is just

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,799
one of many lenses that can happen in a

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,480
work context

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,559
and it's not worth necessarily worse or

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,279
better or special it's just different

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,679
so giving you some context of that i

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,559
think

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,679
was helpful but also remember that any

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,799
of the strategies in any of those ideas

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,399
work just well for your team for

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,559
communicating and supporting your team

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,679
members

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,839
so for me the best thing that helped me

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,000
was just learning about communication

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,079
skills and learning about

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,800
supporting other people regardless of

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,399
the context in which i was doing that

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,480
so you don't only have to use those

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,679
strategies to support your immigrant

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,480
team members

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,280
or understand them just support your

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,919
team members

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,079
with a lot of curiosity and being there

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,359
for them

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,679
thank you all right

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,560
thank you alicia for that um that was a

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,200
great talk

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,040
and um i really liked a lot of these

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,839
points and interesting i think even some

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,919
of them can still

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,520
apply to new jobs and communities as

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,320
other things they can have a lot of

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,159
their

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,079
own cultures when you move into them as

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,320
well and you may not know them but

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,359
um i definitely love the specific call

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,920
out to

00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,000
immigrants in them uh eliza are you

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,200
there and are you unmuted

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,640
i think i need to ask you to unmute

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,400
hi here we go hello um

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,880
i was kind of curious what do you think

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,640
might be the one single most

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,240
uh or the single best thing that a

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,839
teammate could do to support an

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,839
immigrant

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
teammate

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,280
one single thing okay um

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,839
i think the best thing um

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,480
that they can do is just step back

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:36,480
sometimes and give the space

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,680
because oftentimes i would start talking

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,079
about something

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,000
and i process it in a different way or i

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,400
speak about it in a different way

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,920
and people people would get impatient

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,760
and try to help me

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,359
by interrupting me and and going a

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,960
different direction

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,720
um and i think the best thing they could

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,560
do in that moment is step back away for

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,040
me to call them

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,400
and and say hey like now i'm ready for

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,440
you to help me

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,280
um instead of them assuming i need

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,480
help because they might just not know

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,599
what i need

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,359
so there is a lot and wanting to support

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,880
your team members but just

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,640
remembering that you need to understand

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,200
them first before you help them i think

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,480
that's the

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,440
biggest thing yeah that makes a lot of

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,040
sense

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,560
um and how did you personally decide

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,720
what kind of the polish cultures you

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,240
wanted to keep versus what you wanted to

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,720
adapt to like the canadian cultures

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,520
um i think i'm often making those

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,920
decisions

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,280
as i go because there are certain things

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,599
that a few years back

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,599
i would never change and i would say

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,160
this is the core of being polish

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,200
and if you are telling me to change that

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,480
that is just

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,680
rude right this is my culture one of the

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,800
examples was

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,200
pronouns in english polish does not have

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,079
a non-gender specific pronoun the

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,320
language does not

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,920
support that and for a long time i would

00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,119
say you know it's very hard for me to do

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,680
that in english

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,240
because my native language does not have

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,320
it

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,160
and no matter how hard i try my brain

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,560
just thinks in gender binary

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,520
and over time uh by having more and more

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,440
friends who did that

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,359
and my understanding how to use it and

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,079
by just getting support

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,440
in in building that new language i was

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,440
able to start using the

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,079
they them pronouns or you know any

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,839
pronouns that someone has

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,240
and that was a decision i made based on

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,680
immersing myself in the culture and

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,760
going through that hard time

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,240
of of just changing how my brain thinks

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,560
about english and things in english

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,640
so a lot of those decisions i make based

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,640
on you know how much happiness is going

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,720
to bring me and people around me

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,880
um is it going to bring me closer to

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,960
people that i want to be close with

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,640
um and not necessarily is it going to

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,280
make my life easier because some of

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,599
those things are surprisingly hard

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,480
but mostly like can i get the support

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,880
system

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,560
to get there and do i have a safe space

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,839
to make mistakes around it

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,599
um and i don't by now i don't really

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,520
think there is anything i would

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,680
say i'm forever going to do it the

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,720
canadian way i'm forever going to do the

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,000
polish way i think

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,119
they're just going to keep changing yeah

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,440
that makes sense

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,960
um someone had mentioned uh in the

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,960
partifix live channel that they

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,359
sometimes worry about feeling

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,960
some people might see them as a threat

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,000
to local jobs a threat

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,079
um did you face any of this when you

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,200
went over to canada and do you have any

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,920
any suggestions for those that might

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,560
um yeah i have heard go back to your

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,200
country

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,119
a few times um i would say more so in

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,680
the uk than in canada

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,000
um just because of the cultural

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,040
difference to my country like in canada

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,920
it's not as pronounced um

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,359
i usually just if i'm in the space for a

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,640
conversation with that person if they

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,160
are not aggressive because if that

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,200
aggressive i'm just walking right like

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,040
there is no point

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,880
in talking to an aggressive person but

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,880
if it was a co-worker

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,160
or you know someone who is

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,200
feels comfortable speaking their mind um

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,440
i would start being curious like why

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,520
why do you think that like why do you

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,680
think i should go back to my country

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,520
why do you think i'm a threat to the job

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,359
market here like if my employer could

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,800
find someone who's not an immigrant

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,720
i'm pretty sure they would hire a

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,480
non-immigrant it's way easier to hire

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,680
canadians than it is to hire polish

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,440
people in canada

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,119
why would they go through the trouble of

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,800
getting me a job

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,160
and pay me the same because i'm not

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,000
being paid less because i'm an

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,680
immigrant if they could just hire a

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,200
canadian person and never worry about

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,480
the cultural differences and any

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,040
immigration it's just like

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,960
what makes you think i am doing this i'm

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,359
taking away someone's job

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,960
and i think that's a question of like

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,960
can you engage in with this person or

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,680
not do you feel safe to engage with them

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,400
is this situation not threatening to you

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,599
um and do you want to do that right

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,040
because sometimes it's just best to

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,920
ignore them because if you engage with

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,320
them they

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,320
they go off um into more and more

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,079
intense ideas so

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,440
i would make it more of a judgment call

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,440
but if you care about

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,200
a relationship with this person or maybe

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,960
people who have a relationship with this

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,160
person

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,920
try understanding what they are thinking

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,240
about there

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,680
yeah how somebody had said

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,040
they were wondering how they could stand

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,000
up for their co-workers when their

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,440
bosses aren't treating

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,119
them very well because their english

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,119
isn't very good so is there anything

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,720
that a coworker could do

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,720
or is there anything a co-worker did for

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,720
you that was really helpful in some way

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,480
i remember one situation it wasn't less

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,040
about my english it was about someone

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,839
else's english i was working in the uk

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,640
and someone had a very thick irish

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,359
accent

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,359
and at that point my english was pretty

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,200
new and i couldn't understand them

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,119
at all they would speak to me and i

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,880
would try and i just couldn't understand

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,200
them it was so hard

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,640
and i talked to one of my co-workers and

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,160
i said i'm sorry i'm supposed to work

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,560
with this person on the project but i

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,480
just

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,000
cannot understand them for the life of

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,119
me i'm trying

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and i'm just i'm not getting there so

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,280
two things they did

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,640
is um they found a different reason for

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,760
me to not be on a project with that

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,680
person because that would make it

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,160
impossible for us to work

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,440
and then they actually sat down with me

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,520
and started helping me

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,040
understand irish accents we would watch

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,319
videos and they would tell me what the

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,920
videos were about and

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,359
we were talking slowly but surely i

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,160
build up this understanding of the

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,720
accent

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,359
so that was something i experienced and

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,119
then

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,560
supporting my team members here in

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,960
canada um

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,839
i've never experienced that in canada

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,880
but i've

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,240
i've seen other team members maybe not

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,160
knowing what they're supposed to do when

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,480
someone's english is not up to par

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,599
in their opinion and i was just very

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,000
firm i said

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,280
you do not correct someone if it does

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,520
not change the meaning

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,040
you do not correct documentation

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,920
internal documentation

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,400
because somebody you know forgot a v or

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,480
an a

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,400
because prs that are there just to

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,400
correct someone's english

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,520
when they're a software engineer are not

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,760
great because

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,280
you're focusing on something else than

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,319
the job is about right like you don't

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,560
want to spend the time

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,000
correcting their english if it does not

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,640
at the end of the day matter

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,280
you're not there to do that and if they

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,960
ask you

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,800
to help them with their english only

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,640
then you can do it but

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,319
they have been hired for this job

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,560
they're able to communicate

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,480
they're able to do their job unless it's

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,800
interfering with what they're doing

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,000
you do not get to correct them and even

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,839
if you do

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,760
i mean treat it as correcting anything

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,760
else just remember

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,119
language skills are as skill as anything

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,960
else right so

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,839
they can grow and improve them and

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,839
everyone makes mistakes

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,119
