	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,679
um the the the big thing that we want to

00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,400
talk about today is the compensation

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,560
survey

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,639
so um i'm not going to go a whole lot

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,200
into it other than a little bit

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,799
a little bit of detail um so we started

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,000
the compensation survey

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,800
um in 2017 it was something that um

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,279
largely

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,640
i did for my own edification as well as

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,640
those of a few other people that i knew

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,119
who were looking for jobs um

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,160
and it turned out really awesome like it

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,359
was it was

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,760
um dare i say um career changing

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,360
certainly career changing for me um and

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
life-changing for some other people that

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,399
i know

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
got some significant raises out of it um

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,559
we started

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,879
it to do it again in um 2018

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,320
and a little bit again in 2019 both kind

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,120
of got some false starts we decided to

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,719
close it

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,079
but this time around um we uh

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,520
we're very very fortunate to um

00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,800
uh have a great volunteer team um that

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,760
yvette has led and we we met chloe

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,360
in uh january and she has been

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,960
absolutely fantastic

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,799
for this effort so these two have been

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,320
the the main drivers of it

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,560
um as well as myself and sarah with the

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,159
um philip kyler and a few other people

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,960
who have kind of come and gone as as

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,320
time's gone

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,159
on um so um

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,320
the big thing uh this is a results

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,720
preview this is not the final results

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,640
um we're we're very confident what we

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,000
have um but it's not completely

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,560
finalized yet

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
chloe laughs a little bit um because i

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,720
did the analysis

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,360
yes um and we're going to actually

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,759
publish

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,560
a like a full report on this um we have

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,159
this like

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,680
elaborate build system set up that we're

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,560
actually building a document that we're

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,479
going to publish

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,680
and we're going to publish a blog post

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,720
summary of it

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,240
um and um

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,479
so this is like a real thing and we're

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,640
hoping to make this uh

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,240
maybe annual maybe every other every

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,159
other year type thing

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,520
um depending on the what the team wants

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,920
to do with it uh we're

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,520
we're very interested in equipping

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
people with information

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,080
and giving people the freedom to move on

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,040
whenever they

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
realize that they're being underpaid um

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,720
so

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,120
um without uh without further ado

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,920
and to get me to also shut up and stop

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,920
rambling

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,440
um chloe and yvette take it away

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,360
all right i'm sharing the screen now

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,720
do you see it yes yes

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,800
okay great here are a picture of a

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
vetted knight together i photoshopped it

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,080
because

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,440
it's quarantined and so we couldn't take

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,200
a picture together

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,800
um and there are also our pets our

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,800
respective employees of the month

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,120
so i bet this first slide is for you

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,280
yeah i will give

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,959
some of the history um i guess i didn't

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,959
uh talk to colin about this ahead of

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,480
time so we have a little bit of overlap

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:04,319
um just a second

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,000
technical difficulty picked up okay um

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,360
so last survey like you said was in

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,159
2017.

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,519
uh we had about 266 respondents that

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
time and it was focused

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,200
in pittsburgh and marketed pretty much

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,599
directly to the code and supply members

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,280
and um this time like i know they had

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,480
tried to do it before

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
um a year or two ago and it never quite

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,319
picked up

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,599
and this year um

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,760
kind of came up i volunteered um and

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,680
we started meeting in january we set

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,760
some goals and deadlines for

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,760
um where we wanted to be with it in

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,959
terms of questions and

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,360
outreach um and then chloe she

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,360
uh joined a little bit later so um the

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,159
way we plan to do it actually changed

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,319
because she's a

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,840
professional data analyst so i had a lot

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,680
of um skills that we needed

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
so it was good i mean it took a turn for

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,640
the better and now we're gonna have

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,480
like very very accurate and

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,760
analyzed data before it was going to be

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,680
accurate but i think we

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,120
have some um or higher mathematical

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,200
um data points here and some more

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
detailed analysis on the intersection of

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,760
a lot of these questions which is what

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,519
we wanted to do

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,479
and she was really good about doing that

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,079
um so one of the major differences

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,079
between the last survey and this one is

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,400
it's longer there was some stuff we

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,520
wanted to dive into that we were able to

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,360
um we asked more lifestyle questions and

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,680
more specific career questions about

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,919
interviewing um

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
and current job because we had liked

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,639
some of the commute and lifestyle

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,320
questions from the last one so we kind

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,960
of like beefed up that section

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,320
we ended up with around 70 questions um

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,720
i think next time we're gonna

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,479
do it a little smaller um but we

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,080
marketed it around the country and

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,759
basically tried to post and share it

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,240
everywhere that we were allowed to and

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,479
we ended up getting um

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,680
783 people who completed it

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,600
which is pretty good and um

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,360
we were looking for data in a bunch of

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,720
different cities so we could

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,240
analyze trends and help people out um

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,240
who are not part of the code and supply

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,600
and by advertising this we did get a

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,039
bunch of new people join the code and

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,080
supply which is good

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,720
um so we also had a process

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
at the beginning you know we like when i

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,639
first heard about it i was thinking okay

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,479
cool

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,479
we're gonna ask some questions get it

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,160
out in the community analyze it

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,520
and then once you really start working

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
on it you kind of see like

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,039
how specific each question has to be you

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,120
don't want the questions to be like

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,720
very different in style if we probably

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,600
all as a team went through the

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,280
questions like hundreds of times um and

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
we figured out like which analysis tools

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
we wanted to use

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
and the grouping and how big each

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,560
section should be and then colin did a

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,759
really good job of getting us

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,680
some sponsors and

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,800
tried to work on the advertising and he

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,479
got to post in a lot of places too

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,400
and right now we're working on the

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,199
write-up we're gonna have

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,560
um several dozen probably more charts

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,240
and um

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,560
some a blog post and then a formal pdf

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,479
right up with pretty much every detail

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
that you can imagine um

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,759
so this will help people out when

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,960
they're looking for jobs and it'll also

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,440
help out employers

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,800
to maybe see what people are looking for

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,919
and try to offer more

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,919
competitive rates too

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,800
so that's it for the intro

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,120
um chloe's going to talk about the

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,759
analysis of everything that we did

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,440
yeah i like that um now analyze is like

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,560
filled up like it's done but i feel like

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,400
that needs its own

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,880
like process thingy here um

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,759
so i'm going to be talking a lot about

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,080
slope

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,520
um in some of these graphs um so this is

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,000
like an important style

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,880
graph that i may reference this one in

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,160
particular

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,599
is expected total compensation by base

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,800
salary

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,319
um so we can see here um these dots here

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
that are all kind of

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,560
overlapping um and following this like

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,840
nice pretty diagonal line

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,199
um those those dots are very highly

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,880
correlated um so it basically means that

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,880
like they're the same like

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,160
this dot right here we can see this

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,720
person is making

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
200k in expected total comp and they're

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,360
making

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:18,000
200k in base salary um

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,000
so another um just to re-emphasize like

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,080
what slope is so these are people who

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,400
are receiving no additional compensation

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,919
so they're all clustered here

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,759
um and then this is everyone who's

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,599
receiving additional comp

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
so you can see as someone gets further

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,160
to the right

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,880
um the more they're making an additional

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,960
comp

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,120
so like this person here let's see

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,720
they're making 120k

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,440
in base uh but they're making like 345

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,639
in total so that's why it's all the way

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,960
over here

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,919
um so we would say like these points

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,720
here

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,560
have a weaker correlation between

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,440
expected total comp

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,879
and base salary it just means that like

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,960
if we know

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,879
someone's expected total comp it's

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,560
tougher for us to know their

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,280
base salary whereas here if they're

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,120
following this nice pretty slope

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,360
they're have a very high relationship

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,639
so most you guys who took the survey are

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,759
engineers

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,319
um and then you'll note here some of the

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,759
um expect the total compensation for

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,000
these categories

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,759
i'll try to include expected total comp

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
on every graph you see just because that

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,560
is

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
the focus of the survey um but this high

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,200
level view

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,959
um any c-level employee is

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,320
making the most in terms of average

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,440
salary um

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,279
but when i broke the data down i think a

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,600
c-level employee

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:48,640
had the like 34th highest salary

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,920
in the survey so that's just an example

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,760
of how averages can be deceiving

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,600
and then among the people who are

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,839
reported being engineers

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,200
um we can see that 63 percent of them

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,600
work with software

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
um and as expected a senior software

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
engineer

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,519
is making more than a software engineer

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,240
um and

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,760
the third most common title is a lead or

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
a principal engineer

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,959
um and there are some other assorted

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,320
categories that we'll talk about more on

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,920
the write-up just because they're

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,240
like a little bit more niche again it's

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,760
only 17 17

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,560
of all engineers and most you guys who

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,480
took the survey

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,720
are not managers um and you can see

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,600
kind of salary here for that i forgot to

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,360
put seller here

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,680
but it's even more for managers and

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,240
managers

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,839
um so on average managers make more than

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,920
non-managers so we can kind of see the

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,480
distribution of

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,600
everyone who falls into this category um

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,279
so again most people

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,120
are not a manager so there's a lot of

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,399
dots overlapping here

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,440
um and then a few outliers in terms of

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,760
expected total comp um and then kind of

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
the

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,399
center of the distribution

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,519
of expected total comp um just sits

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,000
differently

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,519
higher up for managers and manager

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,800
managers

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,480
overall managers only made up 17

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,079
of respondents and managers of managers

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,040
made up 22 of all managers

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,600
but only four percent of all respondents

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,320
in the survey

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
um so and here um now we don't have as

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
many

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,440
managers of managers to talk about but

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,839
it is interesting how the

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,680
salaries for these managers of managers

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,399
are quite uneven

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,399
um so we can see the lowest salary is uh

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,000
59 000 which is

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,440
quite low compared to like all the

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,680
salaries in the survey i think average

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,839
salary overall was about 100k

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,880
um but also compared to the median

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,560
salary

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,079
um for managers and mentors so that's

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,440
kind of like the point that's right in

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,240
the middle you know equal number of

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,240
points over here

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,079
and equal number points over here so if

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,000
you know anyone in this category

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,360
there's a manager managers let them know

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,800
they are not being fairly compensated

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,640
um and next we're going to talk about

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,240
gender um so

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:14,079
most people who took the survey are men

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,200
um 77 of the sample is male

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,279
um 18 are women um

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,720
three percent are non-binary and then

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,720
two percent chose not to answer

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,560
so uh just due to some um like

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,240
idiosyncrasies in tableau

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,320
the software i use to create these

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,600
visualizations

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,720
sometimes i lump together cisgender and

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,959
trans women

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,760
other times they've shown separately

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,920
this is because

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,160
in some of the styles of graphs if i

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,079
were to put them in the same column

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,000
tableau would give them the same shape

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,399
and color which is

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,079
which i didn't feel like showed the

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,600
differences between the two as much

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,519
of course i welcome any feedback from

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,639
the trans and non-binary community about

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,079
how gender is

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,519
presented in this part of the survey

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,440
so here is just an example of years of

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,320
experience

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,880
by gender so this is an example of where

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,959
like

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,079
if i put trans women and women in the

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,320
same category

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,200
for whatever reason tableau makes them

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,800
all either squares or plus signs

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:24,079
um we are seeing more men with more than

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,760
25 years of experience in the survey

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:30,560
but our sample size was 77

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,920
men so that is probably a contributing

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,079
factor

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,240
um but you can see on average guys have

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,000
about 13 years

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,160
women and trans women are about the same

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,800
at a little over eight

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,800
and non-binary people are around 10.

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,040
um so here we're going to look at this

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,519
is that same graph

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,639
that i showed you at the beginning where

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,160
we were looking at

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,639
expected total comp by base salary

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,839
so you can see for a lot of guys they're

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,600
following on this

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,600
slope very nicely but some of them are

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,880
over here a little bit to the right

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,800
again meaning they make more an

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,959
additional compensation

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,880
i've also plotted on this graph years of

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,480
work experience there's a redundancy

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,240
between color and shape

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,240
uh just to make it more accessible for

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,680
everybody um so we can kind of see

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,480
there's like

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,040
really no rhyme or reason in my opinion

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,240
of

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,639
um years of work experience and

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,160
expected total compensation you know

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,839
there's quite a few dots all the way out

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,480
here that are quite

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,120
light in color and quite small

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,079
indicating

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,600
a fewer years of experience you just

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,560
want to take a note of the salary down

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,720
here

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,560
for guys it's about oh we'll round that

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,839
up to 121

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,160
and now we're going to compare that to

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,000
women who are at about

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,240
103 so women are making about 17 000

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,680
less than men again this is the same

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,920
pattern whereas

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,279
here's the slope so these are women who

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,839
are making

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,880
very little an additional compensation

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,519
and then here's

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,079
uh women who are making a bit more um

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,199
again

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,959
like not a lot of rhyme and reason like

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,800
if we were seeing like

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,240
um years of work experience having a

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,920
very strong relationship you

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,519
we would be seeing like a lot of really

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,040
big shapes over here and that's like

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,680
there's a big shape down here and then

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,480
there's a

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,600
bigger shape here so it doesn't really

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,399
seem to matter

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,360
um and then for non-binary people um i

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,279
think they made up

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,360
uh just a smaller portion of the survey

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,160
so there's just less thoughts here

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,199
um and they make about nineteen thousand

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,199
dollars less than men

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
um so uh you know one thing that we

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,639
could be talking about thing

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,720
here is that um you know men had more

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,399
years of experience so like maybe that's

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,760
why they were making more than women

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,240
um but here i took uh women's average

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,079
years of experience who took the survey

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,279
their average was 8.6 and i excluded

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,480
all men who had more than 8.6 years of

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,600
experience

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,000
um and the trend still persisted uh with

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,800
them making more than women so here we

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,240
see

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,480
about 110 for guys with less than 8.6

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,040
years of experience

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,519
and then when i exclude women with more

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,519
than 8.6 years of experience

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,199
their average total compensation drops

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,360
even lower

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,959
and they're still making about fourteen

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,040
thousand dollars less

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,079
and the trend persists for non-binary

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,959
people as well um

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,720
only making eighty nine thousand dollars

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,639
uh with less than eight point six years

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,079
of experience

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,720
um next just thinking about how

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,519
genders are compensated differently um

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
we'll look at their

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,920
satisfaction with their levels of

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,199
compensation um so we can see most guys

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,839
are in this like uh four category oh so

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,000
the um

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:59,279
scale is very dissatisfied dissatisfied

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,399
kind of neutral satisfied and very

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,839
satisfied so

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,320
looks like most of our guys are pretty

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,720
satisfied with their compensation

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,759
and they are making a little bit more um

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,279
than the average

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,320
for the survey and then compared to

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,040
women

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,759
um it looks like most of our women are

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,360
kind of three

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,199
four five as compared to the guys who

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,320
are kind of four and five

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,839
only um but we can see even the women

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,360
who are like a five

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,240
with their total compensation like

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,480
they're still making like a lot less

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,240
uh like forty five thousand dollars less

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,240
um than guys who are putting themselves

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,079
in the five category

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,920
um and then finally we have non-binary

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,279
people um

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,399
and again they're following a similar

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,399
trend of like um

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,759
like most are pretty satisfied that's

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,680
the people's baseline like if something

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,399
really terrible happens to you

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,839
um at some point you like write yourself

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,360
like you go back to your baseline just

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,639
like people who win the lottery are like

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,399
really happy for a little bit

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,160
and then they kind of drift back to

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,199
their satisfaction baseline so

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,959
it's very hard um on the brain to really

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,559
be in the two or one category for very

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,160
long we would expect someone to leave a

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,439
job if they were

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,439
down here okay

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,360
so then um i looked at satisfaction

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,799
across everything so we asked about a

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,760
number of different dimensions of

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,199
satisfaction

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,319
um including like commute um job working

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,559
arrangements

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,160
um et cetera and then so i kind of put

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,679
them all together into one

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,720
measure of overall satisfaction um so we

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,400
can see

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,919
again most guys are kind of um neutral

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,000
or satisfied

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,640
because it is hard to persist in like

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,640
cell that leaves you below neutral

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,480
and then again we can see the average

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,280
salary for guys here

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,799
so this is just a distribution showing

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,160
um

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,960
how the dots cluster and it's

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,440
interesting because there's no

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,440
strong relationship so so we're not

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
seeing like a slope like we saw before

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,600
in those other graphs

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,400
um this is more of a blob anytime you

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,840
see a blob

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,160
it just means there's there's no

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,720
relationship variables are not related

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,080
um so like there was a stronger

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,919
relationship between like overall

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,880
satisfaction and expected total

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,080
compensation

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,120
you know um it might be that um

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,960
for people like four and above

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,480
all of their dots are like way up here

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,320
in this part of the graph you know

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,840
because they'd be making a lot of money

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,919
um but that actually isn't the case it

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,799
looks like you know roughly

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,559
the same number of dots kind of all in

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,640
this area which ranges

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,919
from 3.2 all the way up to 5.

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,840
and then women have a similar

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,840
distribution um again

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,120
they fall right kind of neutral to

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,559
satisfied again we're seeing that blob

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,280
shape which shows there's no major

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,520
relationship

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,200
between like overall satisfaction and

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,400
all those different areas

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,320
in expected total compensation

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,000
and again the same with non-binary

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,080
people the number is a little bit lower

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
here but that may be because we don't

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,400
have as many non-binary people in this

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,799
survey

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,960
um so most of you guys are receiving

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,880
some kind of additional compensation

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,440
uh the most common form of additional

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,120
compensation for you guys is a bonus

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,640
um other forms of additional

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,760
compensation are

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,200
rsus uh 25 of you have those as part of

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,799
your additional comp

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,400
uh 17 have stock options and 8

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:29,120
do profit sharing um so we can see

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,799
uh pretty much uh except for this

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,880
category here

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,320
uh bonuses less than five percent of

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,160
their base salary

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,200
um people who receive a bonus their

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,720
uh base salary is

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,799
less than their um

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,400
i mean their base salary is greater so

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,000
it's like

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,520
so this is base seller which i know i

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,160
have been talking about

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,960
um expect the total compensation so far

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
because that's like the most

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,039
comprehensive

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,919
measure um but

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,280
this is um yeah this is base and like

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,240
people

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,320
whose base salary is higher are also

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,600
receiving more money

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,760
and additional compensation also this is

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,720
just a coincidence that the number is 67

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,000
in terms of

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,559
most people 67 of you receive a bonus um

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,880
also the average compensation for

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,919
everyone who receives a bonus is

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,480
uh 172 000 which is

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,320
67 percent higher than those who do not

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,760
receive a bonus

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,520
so i don't know if this is a case of

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,960
like people who make more money

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,320
make more money i would have expected um

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,720
like in such high categories like

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,840
where people are receiving like quite

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,600
high salaries

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,440
as are quite high bonuses as a

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,120
percentage of their salary

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,799
for their base salary to be lower

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,919
because they're getting the bonus but

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,880
that is like not the case at all here

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,720
um so here i was like trying to look at

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,120
expected total comp

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,280
and years of experience and there

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,880
continues to be no rhyme or reason like

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,640
i was showing you with this

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,559
um grass with gender remember it had

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,559
like a really neat slope and

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,080
almost everyone was on the slope but um

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,840
the circles were

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,520
like dark and different sizes and it

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,720
didn't matter

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,720
so here i've made the shapes

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,080
experience level instead of years of

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,679
work experience

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,679
so i've got years of work experience on

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,720
the bottom and then the

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,480
shape and the color are related to

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,400
experience title and then we've got

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,520
expected total compensation on the left

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,440
here

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,200
and yeah i mean this so this is blob

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,799
which means no relationship between

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,600
years of work experience

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,440
and expected total comp and then this

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,039
line is kind of just like confirming

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
that like the line is quite

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,240
flat as compared to that slope that was

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,360
like really sharp

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,840
indicating a very strong relationship

00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,080
so there is a relationship between

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,200
um years of work experience and expected

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,799
total compensation

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,799
for people making less than 90 000

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,039
who are not receiving additional

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,760
compensation this is actually the only

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,840
category where i've found any kind of

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,799
relationship between years of work

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,960
experience

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,880
and expected total comp um so

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,559
we're like kind of seeing a pattern here

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,640
you know where we have

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,880
years of work experience on the smaller

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,400
end you know these dots are lighter in

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,760
color and smaller

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,440
indicating um fewer years of experience

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,280
and then we've got the bigger darker

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,280
colored dots over this way

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:42,240
um and then compensation is going up

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,799
as um years of experiences increasing so

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,880
that's

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,559
that's like a decent uh relationship and

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,520
kind of uh consistent with what you

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,039
would expect if you

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,159
know anything about uh check salary

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,520
um but here we're back to the blob um so

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,679
as you can see this line is pretty

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,240
straight

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,799
dots are all different colors and sizes

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,240
and are

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:07,760
all over the place um

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,520
yeah i mean here we're showing between

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,799
90 and 150 000 without additional

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,280
compensation i mean really no

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,559
relationship

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,520
and the blob continues for people who

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,240
are making

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,440
over 150 000 with no additional

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,559
compensation

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,640
um this line persisted even when i

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,919
excluded this outlier i mean there's

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,840
just

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:37,520
nothing here so then i looked at

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,480
um expected total compensation and

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,960
years exp years of work experience who

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,320
are receiving additional compensation

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,640
uh and we're still seeing the same blob

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,080
uh again like really now relationship

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,360
between years of work experience

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,360
and expected total comp

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,400
and there's there's no relationship here

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,480
like the slide is so flat

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,760
um so this is expected total

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,880
compensation for people who

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,000
are receiving additional compensation uh

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,400
total is uh less than 90k

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,440
i mean this is just chaos this is like a

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,520
jackson pollock

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,960
scatter plot here pretty much the same

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,919
no relationship between uh 90 and 150

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,440
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,120
people who are receiving additional

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,919
compensation

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,799
i mean a little bit you know we can see

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,880
some of the

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,640
smaller and lighter color circles are

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,159
clustering over here but then

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,840
we're also seeing kind of bigger and

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,840
darker circles as well so

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:44,159
um yep and still no relationship um

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,360
up there or here i mean there's just

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,640
nothing

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,480
so don't expect years of work experience

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,480
to have any relationship to your

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,799
expected total compensation

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,400
just go out there and ask for the money

00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,400
you want

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,240
um and then lastly is just some stuff

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,720
related to job changes

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,480
um so most of you did not change jobs in

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,440
the last year so that's 62

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,360
of you um and then i've just got um

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,120
average expected total compensation for

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,520
everyone in that category

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,520
so here are those of you who did not

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,080
change jobs

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,440
and then here's the remaining percentage

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,159
of you who did change

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,120
jobs most of you who changed jobs in the

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,480
last year

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,679
saw an increase in your salary and your

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,200
final expected total compensation is 187

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,600
000. um a portion of you

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,720
saw a decrease in your salary average

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,240
expected total comp is 150

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,000
and then the smallest portion of you um

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,919
stayed the same when you change jobs in

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,960
terms of expected total comp

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:55,360
um and your average was about 152 000.

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,000
um so knowing someone is still the

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,039
fastest

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,240
and most common way to find a job so if

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,360
we're looking here the

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,480
pink is a referral from someone you know

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,960
on the orange is any job board

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,960
and we've got internal recruiter

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,159
third-party recruiter

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,360
um met them through a code and supply

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,400
event

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,679
met them at any other networking event

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,720
consulting or acquisition

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,919
having this teal color is a founder

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,679
oh and then some people are like

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,440
self-employed i think there's like one

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,279
person here if you can see it

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,919
that branch type is self-employed so um

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,159
35 of you found a job in less than one

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,559
month so you'd be in this column

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,320
um and most of you found a job through

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,080
someone you knew that would be 42

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,679
of you um and then overall so including

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,000
all of these bars

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,279
38 of you found a job through someone

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,559
new

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,400
followed by 24 of those of you who found

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,960
a job through any job board so

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,039
even if you took four to six months or

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,400
over six months to find a job

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:07,840
um those of you are still finding

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
that job through someone you know

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,840
and then uh finally i've just got some

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:17,039
priorities when evaluating a job offer

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,960
so actually most of you value experience

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,880
or opportunities

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,200
above all else salary actually comes in

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,880
at third in terms of the highest

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,240
priority

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,360
um followed by company culture teammates

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,320
commute company ethics benefits and then

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,200
any other

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,960
compensation and it looks like on

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,799
average those of you who are looking for

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,200
experience or opportunities

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,399
when evaluating your job offer have the

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,960
highest salary on

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:51,679
average and then in comparison

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,720
we have lowest priority when evaluating

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,480
a job offer

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,919
so for most of you that would be other

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,240
compensation

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,120
followed by benefits commute company

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,600
ethics

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,760
experience opportunities teammates

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,880
company culture work-life balance

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:10,320
and then salary is the least common

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,960
lowest priority for you guys um and it

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,480
looks like

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,840
highest salary is commute

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,799
so those of you who value commute the

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,120
least

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,080
oh no it's benefits benefits those of

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,960
you who value benefits the least

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,559
make the most money that's interesting

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,960
okay

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,720
uh and then this last bit is for a vet

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,520
just to talk about the

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,520
future survey

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,240
event did you leave me i could read this

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,240
slide if you left

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,159
on mute um it's okay

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,919
like colin was saying um we're gonna

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,960
plan to do this more regularly

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,039
we got a really good set of questions

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,640
um so we probably won't be spending a

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,399
couple months going over the questions

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,440
so we'll probably call it down

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,600
we also have some thoughts on um

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,480
sending out a post survey survey like

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,320
maybe 10

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,520
questions or so to everybody who took it

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,559
in about a month um

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,000
and to see like what they thought about

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,960
the write-up what we should focus on in

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,360
the future

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,960
um and we also are thinking maybe to do

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,640
a bunch of like micro surveys

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,679
for possible um categories and like

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,600
really get into those

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,360
instead of one massive one we did get a

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,159
lot of feedback that this year was very

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,279
long

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,960
um and i wonder if that dissuaded people

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,520
um so we want like our point is to

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,480
keep up with the trends figure out what

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,960
people want

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,399
and to try to get a wider reach within

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,480
the entire country

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,080
like to get the data but also to connect

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,120
the code and supply to people who live

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,480
in other places

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,799
um so i think with um more

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,799
activities and more maybe some more blog

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,600
posts um just more engagement we could

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,799
find out

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,960
um how we can unite as tech workers

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,640
and you know investigate different

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,279
topics especially related to

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,279
compensation

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,720
um and then just a teaser at the end

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,520
here a predictive model is coming

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,480
but your experience will vary um just

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,960
because

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,240
um if you think about the people who are

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,039
most representative

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,320
in our respondents you know it's size

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,720
kind of mid-level

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,720
i think average salary was around 100k

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,000
uh so predict model like won't work so

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,120
hot for like

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,960
women who are like juniors maybe um so

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,960
that will be going around i'll build

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,960
one probably a regression another one

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,000
will be like a decision tree

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,520
there might be some like black box um ai

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,039
machine learning

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,960
but we'll see i'll probably build two or

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,799
three models and then bother

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,240
those of you who did not take the survey

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,240
for some test data

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,720
just to see if the model is working

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,640
so thank you guys so much um this has

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,120
been really awesome to work on

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,720
uh yeah and i can take questions now i

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,200
know that can also help answer questions

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,799
oh we do have we do have uh one

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,279
outstanding question

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:14,960
um about how this will be distributed

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,000
um i think that's probably one more that

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,039
i can answer

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,320
than you two um

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:25,600
yeah uh this is going to be distributed

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,679
through our website um

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:32,880
code and supply dot co survey

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,919
um and um

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,279
it will be also distributed

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,720
through our blog

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,720
medium.com slash leaky dash abstractions

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,919
which i don't have a

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,320
slide conveniently prepared for um

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,240
the blog will be like a summary of the

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,440
final report of the first version of the

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
final report we're

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,360
intending to do multiple versions of the

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,240
final report as we

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,519
get some feedback on reports that we

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,159
should add

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,159
or on errata things like that

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,519
but we're the pdf will be available

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,080
whenever we get to it probably i think

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,480
we could ship as early as monday

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,600
um it could be as late as the end of the

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,480
month

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,880
but we're we're and um if you follow

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,039
code

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,320
supply in any way you will find it it

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,320
will be on every

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,679
channel i'm sure it will be on my

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,960
linkedin it will be

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,760
it will be twillinger i mean you yeah

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,880
you will not

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,519
miss the results and there are a lot of

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,120
variables that were not included in this

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,679
presentation just for simplicity and

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,760
because

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,000
we wanted to focus on compensation

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,519
because that was the main focus

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,279
um but there's like work-life

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,640
satisfaction

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,840
um there's other variables i should

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,640
remember like if people have health

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,279
insurance or like emergency funds

00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,760
there's lots of other things that we

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,000
have

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:11,840
can include and make grass for so watch

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:11,840
for that in the report

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,120
