The story we’re told is that someone suffering from ADHD is scattered, forgetful, inattentive. They interrupt people, are more likely to be fired from jobs, can’t complete work on time, and absolutely cannot stop talking. Ever.

We’re told that people with ADHD flounder to function in the world around them due to these symptoms. But if we take that story at face value, why are there so many people with ADHD who are able to not only function, but flourish?

I viewed my symptoms as an added obstacle. One day, I committed to changing this viewpoint - I wanted to know why ADHD was viewed and described the way that it was. The viewpoints I had internalized came from studies done in the early 90s. In 2018, two studies showed ADHD in a different light.

Rather than scattered thoughts, we now describe cognitive dynamism: having so many thoughts running through your head that you become energized. Rather than inattentive, we now describe hyper-focus: the ability to become so focused on a task that you disassociate with the world around you. Rather than distractible, we now describe divergent thinking: the ability to generate creative ideas by exploring many different possible solutions.

Let’s start a conversation about the positive, impactful side of ADHD. The side that helps us be better at our jobs and in our communities. If you don’t have ADHD, you will be asked to have an honest conversation with yourself about what kind of preconceived ideas you bring when talking to someone with or about a mental health condition. Together let’s look at changing the story for those with ADHD.

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,480
may include

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,399
hello again thank you sarah

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,760
so hello everyone my name is steve and

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,160
thanks for having me so first things

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,280
first

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,039
um is the safety check um so what are we

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,719
going to be going over in this talk

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,039
um we're going to be going over what

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,960
adhd symptoms look like in adults

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,399
um we are going to be talking about some

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,399
addiction recovery and what that looks

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,719
like for someone with adhd

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,079
or can look like we're going to go over

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,520
the history a little bit

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,359
what it's like to change careers with

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,159
adhd and

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,360
uh we're gonna look at toward the end um

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,119
some reasons why

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,320
adhd symptoms are worthy of conservation

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,479
so let's get started

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,680
so most people when they think of

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,119
someone with

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,159
adhd they think it's something like this

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,840
this young kid appears to be uh

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,080
breaking his pencil in seeming

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,159
frustration

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,200
at the tasks his teachers are asking him

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,320
to do

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
um and for about half of the adhd

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
community

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,439
our conditions don't go away when we

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
enter adulthood

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,079
um but whenever i ask someone to picture

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,680
what a person with adhd looks like

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,759
um i almost never get an adult i also

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,880
almost never get um a woman or person of

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,439
color but

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,159
that's an entirely separate uh talk

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,720
there

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
um and so i want you to take a moment

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,240
and

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,360
think about how you would describe an

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,360
adult with adhd

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,439
most people will come up with a list

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,560
that looks something like this

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,120
people with adhd are uh impatient

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,239
we're loud disruptive we don't follow

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
directions

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,879
uh we can't keep track of things and we

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,560
generally don't stop talking ever um

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,640
so if you do a quick google search

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,120
you'll get about five million different

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,840
ways

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,040
of describing this same set of symptoms

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,319
and so

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,879
i want you to keep these symptoms in

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,080
mind and i'm gonna tell you guys a story

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,400
for the rest of this

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
and um by the end of this talk you will

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,599
hear this full story

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,920
unless i get distracted um so

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,680
about two years ago um the company i

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,879
worked for started ergs

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,879
and uh one of the ergs that formed out

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,200
of that was a group of us

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,239
who got into tech without a traditional

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,879
college degree

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,920
for our fields and this group of people

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,959
said

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,480
something we really need is more avenues

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,800
into tech

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720
that don't require you to funnel through

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,440
a university to get there

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,120
and so uh the group started pioneering

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
uh an apprenticeship program

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,120
um and this getting involved in this

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,319
program turned out to be one of the most

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,360
impactful experiences of my life um

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,760
and i got to meet with um

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,080
so many different people from so many

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,280
different lived experiences

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,599
um i got to meet with a millionaire ceo

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,159
who had lost everything i got to meet

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,360
with a teacher who just loved to code in

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,879
their free time

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,640
i got to talk to someone who was

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,760
convicted of murder and was a

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,040
returning citizen back to

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,159
back to society um

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,360
and those were really interesting

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,080
experiences and i wouldn't have had

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,120
those had not gotten involved with this

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,599
but i wasn't just starting to learn

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,640
about

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,920
other people's experiences

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,200
i also started to uh learn more about my

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,200
own

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,519
and everything was going super well

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,319
right we had executive buy-in on this

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,280
program

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,680
um my job as an engineer was going well

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,080
um

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,879
everything on the surface appeared to be

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,879
going pretty well

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,959
outside of the public eye things weren't

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,080
going so well

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,320
i was losing a battle with addiction to

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,520
my adhd medication

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,199
and there was an interesting duality

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,639
an interesting the painful duality with

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,240
that in that

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,080
your medication becomes both your

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,120
antidote and your poison at the same

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,240
time

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,000
and i could win my battle with adhd

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,040
or with my adhd medication but

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
i had to live with these symptoms as the

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,440
alternative

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,080
and the youtube videos um the articles

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
online

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,600
the way that people around me and

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,199
society in general talked about adhd

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
symptoms

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
that made that decision super easy for

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
me and it was to stay in active

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,840
addiction

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,400
um so eventually i took the leap

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,120
and i stopped my medication and i

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,360
started

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960
to pursue a career in uh learning and

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,880
development talent development

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,400
um largely that was fueled by

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,000
inspiration and intrigue from that

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,199
apprenticeship initiative

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,639
and i asked myself a question that led

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,840
me down this rabbit hole

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,639
that led me here which was i

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,520
needed to understand why society had

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,120
this view

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,800
of adhd why were these symptoms

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,800
what everyone would talk about

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:45,360
so how did we get here 1955

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,240
ritalin became fda approved the 1960s

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,680
uh the american psychiatric association

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,759
formally recognized

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
this set of symptoms as a mental

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,880
disorder

00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,000
fast forward to the 80s they

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,319
the apa released their third edition of

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,560
the

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,319
diagnostic and statistical manual of

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,120
mental disorders

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,560
pretty much the de facto standard for

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,680
diagnosing someone with a mental health

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880
condition

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,720
um and we got add

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,880
and we got two different forms of add we

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
got add with hyperactivity

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,800
and without and scientists actually

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,440
believed back then that hyperactivity

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,400
was not

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:30,080
inherently a symptom of adhd or adhd

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,400
so a few years later in 1987

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,440
we finally got two distinct names we got

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,960
80d

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,319
and adhd and then the 90s came

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,680
and this was the adhd

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,680
boom era and

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,960
doctors were able to more efficiently

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,800
diagnose adhd

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,000
more treatments were becoming available

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
parents became

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
more educated about the condition and

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,639
started to talk to their children's

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,400
doctors

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,120
and more people were actually developing

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,120
adhd

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:06,240
so during these adhd boom era

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,639
um the add adhd community was receiving

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,599
more attention than it ever had before

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,840
um

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,800
doctors had taken this set of behavior

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,680
patterns these

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,880
fuzzy concepts um and they gave it a

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,919
name

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,880
and uh this led to

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,440
this description of adhd that people um

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,599
from all different kinds of generations

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,000
internalized as uh threads that make up

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,400
the fabric of who they are

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,400
and and then something happened there

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,360
was a new president of the apa

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,440
uh dr martin seligman and he looked at

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,000
his colleagues and he said

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,639
what if mental health isn't about the

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,039
absence

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,919
or lack of mental disturbances or

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,160
differences

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,560
what if instead mental health is about

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,960
flourishing and well-being

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,160
and so i handed off responsibility for

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
the apprenticeship program

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,520
to someone else on the team that we had

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,039
built um i

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,960
came up with a succession plan for the

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,680
erg to put someone else in leadership

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,879
for it

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,800
um and with my newly reduced capacity

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,400
to regulate my attention from beating my

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,639
addiction um

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,319
i needed to think very carefully about

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,240
what kinds of things i could manage at a

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,080
given time in my life

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,360
and this is a common dilemma for people

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,919
with adhd we we

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,720
quite infamously have um quite a lot of

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,680
plates

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,240
spinning all at once but there's a trap

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
here

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,560
that i ran into um because of the way

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,360
adhd

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,159
is talked about described and ultimately

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,760
the way

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,440
a lot of people both with it and without

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,719
it internalized the uh

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,399
the condition um

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,480
we think that if we have access to tasks

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,160
that are making us inattentive we're

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,519
more likely to develop energy

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,040
or devote energy to those tasks

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
and our condition is really viewed

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,000
through the lens of

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,480
um of lack we're not able to regulate

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,480
our attention on these things so thus

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,240
these things need to go away

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,800
um and the trap here is that

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,680
when you remove those there's an

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
expectation

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,959
of behaviors for how you go about

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,080
prioritizing

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,120
tasks and in most cases those

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,839
expectations

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,640
um are for executive functioning

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,160
behaviors

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,920
of someone who doesn't have adhd um

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,240
and so there's an assumption that when

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,240
those things go away that the

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,320
distractions go away and so one of the

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,800
few things that was left in scope

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,440
for me was my pursuance of a career in

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,600
learning development and

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,760
this was around the time that i

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
committed to changing how i viewed adhd

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,959
i felt like there had to be

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,480
a healthier way to look at this thing

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,680
that didn't make me feel so

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,279
ostracized from society and there had to

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,080
be a way to explain it to people

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,720
that made me feel empowered rather than

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,080
made me feel smaller

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,640
so in 2018 a group of scientists came

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,760
together

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,680
and they conducted this rigorous study

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,000
of a particularly fascinating symptom of

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,120
adhd

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,200
and there's a lot of work that

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,360
needs to happen to create real change in

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,760
our perception and classification of

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,519
inattentiveness but i think if we can

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,959
start to make space for conversations

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,360
like this i think we might

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,760
just be able to get to good enough for

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,920
um how we understand inattentiveness

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
so these scientists came together and

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,240
they studied the symptom called hyper

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,160
focus

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,040
and is often misunderstood as

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,640
the lack of an ability to focus um but

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,279
that only paints a little bit of the

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,880
picture

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,839
and when we look closer we start to get

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,240
some color and hyper focus is a symptom

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,959
and the goal of their research was to

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,160
determine

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,079
whether or not there was a connection

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,600
between adhd and the ability to hyper

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,680
focus

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,200
turns out there was um and

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,440
adhd gets impacted uh from hyper focus

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
just like neurotypical brains uh can get

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,880
impacted from hyper focus

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,800
and their research showed that there

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
were two types of flow states that

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,000
people enter

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,279
um the first is shallow flow this is the

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,839
flow that lets

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,440
neurotypical folks prioritize tasks

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,680
switch between them

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,120
with limited ramifications and generally

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,200
pretty easy

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,200
they get in the zone and generally see

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,770
these tasks through

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,839
to completion

00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:30,160
[Music]

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,000
then uh second is the deep flow states

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,279
um and deep flow is a state where

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,399
someone's ability to

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,279
concentrate on a particular task or idea

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,839
is so strong that they actually become

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,959
disassociated with the world around them

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,200
and

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,399
they become completely immersed in that

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,839
tasker idea

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:53,200
and what their study found was that for

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,519
most people you can enter a shallow flow

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,680
state with relative ease

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,279
deep flow is achieved far less

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,639
frequently and is always

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,639
precluded by a period of shallow flow

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,160
in practice this means that someone

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,399
becomes focused on a task

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,800
then either completes the task without

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,880
achieving deep flow or the person

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
uh moves on to a deep flow state after

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,839
spending some time in shallow flow

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,560
um but then what they found was that

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,200
adhd brains don't operate that way

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,320
those with adhd rarely enter a state of

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,839
shallow flow

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,680
and the way we typically see that

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,959
described is someone is inattentive or

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,839
easily distractible however they also

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,200
discovered

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,320
that those with adhd experience high

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,680
amounts of deep flow states um and we

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
don't need the prerequisite

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,440
of a shallow flow state before that we

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,240
can go straight into deep flow

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,120
um and this has a lot of ramifications

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,480
on

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,760
how we um where job descriptions

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,760
and how we hire to really

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,399
include people who can enter those deep

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,440
flow states almost exclusively

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,720
and so i had stepped away from the

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,120
things that were

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,040
making me inattentive but i couldn't

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,399
just turn my adhd off

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,680
um after spending hundreds of hours

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,519
researching and building out our

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,519
apprenticeship program with the team

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,440
um what was really important was that

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,720
an apprenticeship be an unforgettable

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,360
experience and having gone through

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,600
multiple

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,440
mental health crisis um with the people

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,440
that i worked with

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,959
i knew the support existed at the

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,399
company that i was at

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,760
um and the fact that an apprenticeship

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,279
has the power to change someone's life

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,600
was at the forefront of

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,720
every decision that i made or that i

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,279
weighed in on

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,880
and i began studying apprenticeships in

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,440
other countries and

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,920
examining schools and workplaces

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,519
workplace development programs for

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,279
kids and adults with learning

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,800
differences and disabilities to get a

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,959
better understanding of

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,959
what we needed to have in place to

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,399
provide an experience that really

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,399
reached and resonated with them

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,160
so what does this mean talking this

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,199
understanding of inattentiveness and

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
hyper focus

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,800
how do i bring that back to the

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,279
workplace with me um first one

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,959
is neurodiversity start talking about it

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,839
it is the idea that

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,959
uh diverse neurological conditions are

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,079
from brain differences

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,440
not just deficits and there's a couple

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,639
keys here

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,240
what you choose to communicate and how

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,760
you communicate it

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,519
sets the social tone for those

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,440
conversations

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
everyone is at different stages of

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,480
understanding

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,920
their mental health and nobody is above

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,279
or below anyone else and this is one of

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,240
my favorite things about having mental

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,920
health discussions

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,000
is it seems to pause any kind of

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,760
existing power dynamic that's in play

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,639
and everyone is just talking to each

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,440
other human to human

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,920
the other thing is um start to talk

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,720
about adhd as a difference in attention

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,560
not just a deficit

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,519
look at how jobs are performed

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,240
do they cater to attention styles that

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,279
include

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,839
hyper-focused tendencies for example the

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,079
way your career pathing works in your

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,120
organization

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,079
is that pathing accessible for people

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,279
who

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,120
thrive in hyper focus

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,800
organizations also really need to see

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,639
their employees as strategic partners

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,360
and not a cost of doing business

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,440
and you can sort of do that by talking

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,440
about the strengths that accompany adhd

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,720
and not just trying to minimize or

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,839
accommodate

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,839
adhd weaknesses

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,279
so i had a pretty muddy journey um as

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,040
this is a picture from a hike and uh as

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,720
a little boy pointed out to me

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,079
uh peanut butter shoes that's what this

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,240
is um

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,519
so i had started and stepped away from

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,959
responsibilities that have been so

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,279
important to me

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,240
um i'd won my battle with addiction and

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,839
it's a war that

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
i'm now equipped to fight for a long

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,360
time and i

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,519
navigated these raw adhd symptoms in the

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,560
workplace and i didn't get fired

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,519
i was rising as a software engineer and

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,959
um i fell in love with how people learn

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,880
so

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,959
i did what any reasonable person would

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,240
do i left them went on a sabbatical

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,680
and i tried to straighten it all out and

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,600
i hiked from mexico to canada taking

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,360
planes from each state and just

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
photographing the rockies

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,279
and i also became closer to buddhism

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,639
which isn't a coincidence

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:35,279
but i'll get more on that later so

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,399
i ended my sabbatical really focusing on

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,759
was there more

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:44,639
to adhd the real adhd

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:47,040
than hyper focus turns out there is

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,480
there are other benefits so later this

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,360
same year

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,079
another group of scientists conducted um

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,160
a study

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,519
that answers that question and it turns

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,560
out there's quite a few benefits

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,759
indeed that exist on a spectrum

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,600
so what they did is they performed

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,720
open-ended interviews with adults with

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,959
adhd

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,199
using first-person experiences to

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,600
approach and collect data

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,039
um they recorded these um they

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,760
transcribed them verbatim

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,799
and they analyzed them and they found a

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,079
few things

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,760
there was an entire group of people who

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,079
talked about their adhd in a different

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,480
way in a way that was empowering

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,439
and they talked about things like hyper

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,600
focus and

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,559
etic learning which is the ability to

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,840
learn from

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,280
really vividly recalled events and

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,520
experiences

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,520
and

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,640
the medical community uses that standard

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,400
the dsm

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,480
for diagnosing mental health conditions

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,200
and dr seligman

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,720
who pioneered the positive psychology

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,039
movement

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,039
created the opposite he created the csv

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,919
the character strengths and virtues

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,480
and what he did wanted to do with that

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,720
was

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,760
he wanted to understand prescriptively

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,720
um what promotes well-being and

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,520
flourishing

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,880
in everyday people's lives and so these

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,360
scientists looked at

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,960
what neurotypical folks typically

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,280
identify on the csv

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,039
and then they looked at what adhd folks

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,840
identify on the csv

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,400
and they compared these lists and wanted

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,160
to see

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
what attributes were specific to folks

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,960
with adhd

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,640
so they found some things people with

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,919
adhd

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,039
are cognitively dynamic so this is a big

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,240
word this is a new one

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,240
this was a new one for me too so what do

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,880
they mean by this they mean

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,320
this is the this is having ceaseless

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,559
mental activity

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,480
where you have spontaneous

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,559
non-sequential thoughts

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,880
but you have so many of them that you

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,600
become energized

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,720
and some of the sub-themes for this that

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,120
we'll go over

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,000
um divergent thinking hyper focus

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,799
creativity

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,080
and curiosity some of these are owned by

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,120
everyone some of them are specific to

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,640
adhd we'll get into that

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,320
energy was another character strength

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,520
and virtue that they talked about

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,720
and what they mean by energy is the

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,480
intensity of internal experiences and

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,679
the capacity for action and

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,000
they have three sub themes they have

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,760
spiritual psychological and physical

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,440
and i realized when i was out on my

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,200
sabbatical um

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,880
my deep interest in buddhism was fueled

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,320
by this and

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,600
spirit here um is

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,080
an experience that embraces a higher

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,720
level

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,600
of self sense of purpose or meaning in

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,760
life

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,039
um there isn't a religious connotation

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,880
necessarily

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,200
um and then psychological energy is

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,200
someone has when someone has um

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,360
volition so the will to decide

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,400
or commit to a particular course of

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,280
action

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,039
and what happens is that high volition

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,760
requires someone to have this

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,880
high desire to achieve something and

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,200
that eventually

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,000
transforms that psychological energy

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
into physical

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
energy

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,960
so there's a couple um course

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,240
corrections that we can make

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,120
from uh all of this this research

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,320
um people are not people with adhd are

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,960
not slow workers

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
um divergent thinking was one of the uh

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,559
sub themes here that came out

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,799
specifically for people with adhd and

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,840
that is the ability to generate these

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,159
novel or original ideas

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,760
we do that by exploring many different

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,080
possible solutions

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,039
where a neurotypical brain might go okay

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,039
i have

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,679
solution a b and c i'm going to go with

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,080
b um an adhd brain might say

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,880
i have a b and c i want to understand

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,000
what d e

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,200
f g is and so we explore

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,280
all of those solutions and as such

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,559
divergent thinking is actually a

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,760
measurement of creativity

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,400
how much of an outside of the box

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,400
thinker you are

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,880
another one that was unique to adhd is

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,640
hyper focus we already went over this so

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,679
i'm going to skip over that

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,799
um non-conformism

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:16,240
um so non-conformism is

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,240
closely linked to courage and

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,280
we deal particularly well with

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,480
uncertainty

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,039
in crisis um and feeling

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,720
different for us can start at a really

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,000
young age and it starts with the public

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,039
school system

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,640
um and non-conformism

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:38,240
really at its core is a resistance

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:42,840
to soldier uh social or cultural

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:46,080
modification i guess you could say um

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,520
and as a result

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,600
of feeling different of being

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,320
non-conformist um a lot of people with

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,360
adhd

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,480
struggle for recognition and they get

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,559
misrecognized

00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,120
their behaviors which are um generally

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,000
well intended or to them are perceived

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,440
as well

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,080
um are perceived as uh someone being

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,120
difficult

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,840
or um wanting to do things

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,240
a way that no one else wants to do them

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,159
and

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,360
so the misrecognition of adhd as a

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,720
disability

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,200
um exclusively accentuates how

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,240
this sort of labeling and stereotyping

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,360
can be used to

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,280
sort of put us in boxes and it's

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,640
important to know that

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,320
this misrecognition is a social process

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,880
it is not necessarily an internal

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:39,120
process

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,120
only um it is also a social process

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,919
so what else we're not impulsive risk

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,400
takers we're adventurous

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,280
and there's something interesting here

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,640
with this one

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:54,240
because this had to do with

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,520
how other people react to our behaviors

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,080
so someone exhibits a particular

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,360
behavior

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,000
and if the reaction was negative um

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,320
it was viewed as impulsive but when the

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,559
reaction was positive

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,799
then the action or the behavior was

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,919
described as spontaneous and intuitive

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,200
um and so there's a willingness

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,159
that develops here to be brave to take

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,720
those risks

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,559
to be adventurous um and to be

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,840
responsible for your actions

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,720
and all of that leads to really high

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,400
levels of

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,760
integrity and authenticity in people

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,880
with adhd

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,200
and a hallmark of that behavior is

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
how much intrinsic motivation someone

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
has

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,360
um we're moved by the challenge or fun

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,000
that we see in something

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,480
and so we generally don't move very much

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,640
to

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,039
external um rewards or

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,880
external pressures uh that isn't how

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,240
adhd brains typically tick

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,360
uh we can't be bought um

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,720
and it's this intrinsic motivation that

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,120
this thrill of the the hunt of an idea

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,320
that allows us to maintain a positive

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,400
sense of self

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,360
while we're embarking and navigating our

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,400
adventure

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,960
and this this is what makes adhd brains

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,840
really good at reaching some goal that

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,840
they have

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:28,799
okay um we're making excuses

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,799
excuses we are accepting ourselves

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,960
this study also concluded that

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,080
successful adults with adhd

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,520
had an intensely positive mental

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,240
attitude

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,120
and this helps us cope with things like

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,480
um

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,520
stress by giving us this biologically

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,080
effective tooling in our adhd

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,760
to promote well-being for example during

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,000
a crisis

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,000
we're damage control experts and can

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,480
maintain this positive attitude

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,799
when neurotypical brains maybe have some

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,799
different views and i want to hit on

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,000
something really important here

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:09,200
and it's that sometimes the most

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,200
difficult people to accept in your lives

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:16,799
are ourselves our family our spouse

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,120
our friends um and by accepting

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,720
not just your limitations but also what

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,000
you excel at

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,080
you make space to accept others

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,039
as they are based on their strengths and

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,120
their weaknesses

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,039
and if you only see the deficits the

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,120
missing pieces in yourself

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,360
that's all you're going to see in others

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,840
and this is what makes adhd brains

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,480
so exceptional at things like social

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,840
work

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,760
social justice work and work in the dni

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:47,120
space

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:50,320
we aren't naive we prac

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,480
we excel at sublimation

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,320
sublimation was another new one for me

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,720
and that is the

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,360
unconscious defense mechanism it's not

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,799
deliberate

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,919
it's not by choice it is the ability to

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,720
alter a person's perception of an

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,799
external

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,120
or internal experience and in doing so

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,080
um that person protects against the

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,679
effects of stress

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,520
anxiety depression and so on um

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,880
things that could be taken as

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,600
inappropriate behavior

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:27,120
or odd we sort of perform this

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,080
cognitive reappraisal of it as an act of

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,039
self-preservation

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,039
something we're really good at

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:41,039
so what can we take away from these um

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,559
so we want to start talking less about

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,600
these

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,720
and we want to start talking more about

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,559
these

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,200
um there are a few

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,799
structural pieces that make this

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,200
cognitive reappraisal

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,760
um more successful when you go to

00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,760
implement it

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,480
so what are those things the first is

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,559
it's really important to have two-way

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,559
empathy and what i mean by that

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:15,279
is for someone who has adhd

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,080
it's very easy to become jaded toward

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,840
people

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,520
or maybe even a whole organization

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:25,360
because from our set of shoes

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,840
um it can get frustrating people always

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,440
saying

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,880
you're not prioritizing tests correctly

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,679
you shouldn't do this you should do this

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,200
instead

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,360
when really we think we should be doing

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,679
this and not the thing you want us to do

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,559
um and so you can it can get really

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,559
frustrating

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,880
and likewise for the person on the other

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,159
end um it can get really frustrating

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,039
where you're just trying to help this

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,159
person

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,600
um navigate a situation and it seems

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,480
like they really aren't

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,919
doing what you're suggesting and having

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,960
that two-way empathy

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,399
that both sides of this

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,600
are experiencing frustration is really

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,640
important

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,600
and one big piece of that

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,000
is the role that mentors play and there

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,559
were

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,039
plenty of times where me and my mentor

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,840
would go out for a walk and

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,320
i would be talking about um how

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,679
difficult it is to stay sober and if i

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,320
went back on my medication all these

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,760
struggles of managing these this career

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,080
while trying to navigate

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,360
into this other one um all that would

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,440
have went away

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,679
um and so sometimes those walks would

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,679
just be talking about

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,600
the struggle of of addiction and

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,440
it's really important to have a release

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,039
valve whether that's in a mentor whether

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,640
that's a family member you need

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,360
somewhere to be able to talk about these

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,559
these

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,080
internal experiences and

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,000
there's also a key part of this that's

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,840
having an informed team because you can

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
come to all these conclusions

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,159
but if your team isn't made aware of

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,919
these kinds of experiences

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,559
how can they possibly know about them

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,240
and there's some work that they do on

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,039
their own but there's also a little bit

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,840
of work

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,799
from us um and i think it's actually

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,080
helpful for us

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,320
to be able to talk about these things

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,679
out in the open and

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,960
a big part of that is having leadership

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,919
that has

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,720
an open mind um some organizations

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,919
leadership is

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,720
sort of stuck in their ways and using

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,039
a strengths-based approach to job

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,840
descriptions promotion pathways

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,840
how you hire

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,799
isn't necessarily how most places work

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,320
by default most places work on

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:44,480
building up your weaknesses um

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,320
a big way to do this is uh something

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,880
called job crafting job crafting is

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,919
where

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,520
you take a look at your strengths and

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,919
cater your job to those strengths

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,600
and that might be eliminating some

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,799
duties that might be

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,080
idiosyncratic deals where you know

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,520
you know you have a strength and you

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,960
know you have a weakness and so you ask

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,240
this person to take care of the weakness

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,000
and you'll take care of the

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,799
thing that you have a strength in and

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,720
everyone wins um

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:17,120
but it requires some work

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,279
between the person and the organization

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,080
and that's really where

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,840
viewing employees as strategic partners

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,880
that has to be laid as the foundation

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,880
first for that to work

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,440
and so that's it and i will leave you

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,039
with this

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,399
in that what if

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,880
this way of viewing and promoting the

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,080
internalization of mental health

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,440
conditions

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:49,440
isn't just limited to adhd

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,320
thanks all right thank you steve

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,480
um hopefully our very active slack right

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,200
now wasn't being too distracting during

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,039
your talk

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,519
um it's good to see a lot of people

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,919
chiming in about this talk in particular

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,200
um do you think our actually one of our

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,640
attendees had mentioned

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,640
that they've been working on skills with

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,000
their therapist um do you have any good

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,240
tools or approaches that you could use

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
to help accommodate some of those adhd

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,519
things or things like to-do lists or

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,279
pomodoro techniques

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,600
other things like that sure um

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,320
so i i do want to say it's different for

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,159
everyone so

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,880
this isn't going to be a silver bullet

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,440
um there is no real silver bullet answer

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,600
some things that have helped with me um

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,320
color coordinating things

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,120
whether this is different things in my

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,440
ide

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,720
when i'm engineering um my google

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,640
calendar is like a

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,399
rainbow and uh

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,480
on the note of the calendar if something

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,480
isn't in my calendar it doesn't exist

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,120
um there's a zero percent chance i'll

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,679
remember and even if it's in my calendar

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,960
if i'm really into something it still

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,080
might not exist

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,640
um so making sure that you have like

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,640
notifications turned on and that this

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,240
event on your calendar will send you a

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,519
notification on your desktop

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,279
um that's super important um

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,960
some things that have also helped is

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,000
getting if you're in a open office

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,720
environment

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,440
either that's that's the most difficult

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,720
one i think

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,320
for me um and some things that have

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,760
helped were a really good pair of noise

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,600
cancelling headphones

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,159
um a set of desk dividers which are

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,080
literally

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,519
like sort of soundproof walls you can

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,640
put on the corners of your desk

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,880
and it's kind of awesome because you

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,320
like have your own fort pretty much

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,159
and it's pretty cool um and then the

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,279
alternative is working from home

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,960
um strangely enough working from home

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,200
uh i'm kind of always stimulated by all

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,120
the things around me in my house

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,960
and so i don't really need to like go

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,480
searching for stimulation and so i'm

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,360
able to actually just sit here and do my

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,720
work

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,919
and i think those are probably the

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,840
biggest ones yeah i'm definitely

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,159
a little bit over stimulated in my home

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,640
too sometimes especially with the cats

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,440
um i have a thought while we were

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,279
talking a bit

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,440
and um it seemed like developers you

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,559
know usually kind of have to be thinking

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,320
outside the box and

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,399
even some of the other symptoms you had

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,440
mentioned i was kind of wondering if

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,840
like c-level people or other managers

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,159
might

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,519
not be so much like they they're just

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,880
their way of thinking is a little bit

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,320
different and if there might be some

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,360
conflict there

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,600
between you know the i guess

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,480
more creators and engineers that might

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,480
have

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,840
some more of those symptoms versus like

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,919
those that might not be

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,120
and if there's any good way to resolve

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,960
maybe some of those conflicts

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:46,559
yeah um so

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,559
i think it's really important to

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,080
if you make the decision to disclose

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,279
your adhd

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,799
at work um

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,440
it's really important to advocate for

00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,519
yourself

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,960
and it's really scary in the beginning

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,720
um because most of the time when you

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,480
disclose something like adhd

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,600
you have no you have no clue how people

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,599
are going to react and

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,399
so i think i think the best way to sort

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,760
of go about it

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,320
is just hammering it out um just talking

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,000
it out

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,040
and saying listen um

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
there's some aspects some dimensions of

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,639
my identity that make me really good at

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,359
particular things in engineering

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,040
and just being honest with hey i get

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,440
really good at these things

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,720
but these things are just not going to

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,679
tick for me

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,720
and i don't want to say it's a

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,480
negotiation

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,919
but it's it's an acknowledgement that

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,480
a lot of these skills exist on a

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,280
spectrum and that some skills

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,960
can have their their ceiling their cap

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,000
increased or they can have their ceiling

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,920
or cap decreased

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,680
from that adhd maybe less negotiation

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,119
and more collaboration perhaps

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:17,839
right right collaboration not

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:17,839
negotiation yeah yeah

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,119
