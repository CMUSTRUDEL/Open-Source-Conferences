in-person event in april 2018. jenny

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,360
a conference focused on mental health

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,320
specifically focused on software

professionals

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,080
sharing their experiences and advice we

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
added community building and it was

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,320
popular it sold out

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,760

meaningful discussions and to build

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,959

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,079

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,480
tens of thousands of dollars

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,160
and virtual events cost considerably

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
less there's still a lot of expenses

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,399
that go into an event like this

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,440
their support helps make it possible

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,519
keeps your tickets

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,120
affordable and helps us to pay our

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,639
speakers so we want to thank our

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,600
sponsors

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,000
um i'm not seeing them calling you when

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,600
i

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,920
cut over to the slide

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,839
oh there they are there we go yes there

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,160
we go thank all of you

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,120
uh sponsors true fit elastic code and

if you are watching at the moment maybe

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,120
you can screenshot this slide and thank

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,639
them on twitter or

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:54,000
other social media

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,160
all right in case you haven't heard 2020

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,240
has been a bit of a rough year with the

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,120
pandemic among what feels like a million

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,800
other things

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,399
you're probably a bit burnt out which is

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,640
why our first talk of the conference is

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,799
a great way to start artifacts off

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,079
our first presenters are anwan swimmons

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,880

and dr anika simmons anwan is a

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,079
technologist with a successful track

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,079
record of delivering technology

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,959
solutions from the user interface to the

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,880
database

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,199
he combines his experiences working at

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,199

as well as small technology startups to

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,039
implement practical solutions

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,160
that can be understood and scaled across

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,919
organizations

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
he's an energetic and informative

university

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,880
prior to pursuing her phd dr simmons

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,240
worked for accenture

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,720
in cap gemini ernst and young as an

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,640
university of houston

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,880
the two of them will be sharing about

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,720
how you can manage the burnout burn down

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,120
so here they are dr enika simmons and

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,160
ann won simmons

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,000
on simmons and i'm dr anika simmons and

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,840
this is our talk on managing the burnout

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,360
burndown so let's

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,720
get right to it

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,440
so if you're like me then you work in

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,960
software

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,840
and you are just a real fan of the fact

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,480
that we can turn

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,919
any idea into working software that

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,720
anything that we think of

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,080
that we think our users won't can become

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,080
code and

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,000
the excitement around this has been

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
something that the media often reports

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
on the idea that these

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,720
amazing companies that most of us use

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,840
some of their

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,880
software to figure all daily lives

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,360
um started in garages as just ideas and

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
so

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,360
there's a lot of press about how

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,799
software is cool

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,919
in fact this exuberance has even come

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,880
from the levels of companies that most

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,960
of us

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,960
uh have heard of to even our day-to-day

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,559
lives and the idea that

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,440
anyone can take a really easy to use

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,799
language

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,679
and then create something everyone

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,799
carries around in their pockets to use

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,640
every day but there is a dark side to

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,160
building software that is not as well

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
covered in the media

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,679
and that's the fact that building

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,679
software can be exhausting

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,960
and some of this exhaustion is due to

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,280
the fact that software

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,640
is an industry that's always changing

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,200
there is some new

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,080
language or framework or technology that

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,280
we need to use

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,440
to do our daily work and for a lot of

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,520
people this is really surprising because

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,960
software's not like construction and

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,559
most of you watching this you're

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,159
in a building that has a floor and it

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,320
has walls and a ceiling

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,440
and people actually did labor to lay

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,000
that floor and

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,520
hang the drywall on those walls and put

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,840
up the light fixtures

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,280
and so we think about that as labor and

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,120
we don't think of building software as

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,919
labor because often we're sitting at our

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,320
desk and

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,520
we may have some nice uh well-crafted

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,000
coffee next to us

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,720
and we are usually sitting in nice plush

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,520
chairs

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,320
but building software is labor uh it is

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,120
work that

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,520
it does extract a cost to the people who

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,600
work

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,600
in software development and it's this

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,240
dark side of software development

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,320
that we often don't talk about and the

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,280
fact is that building software does

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,240
put a mental and psychological burden on

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,679
the people

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,280
who write software and those are the

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,840
engineers the testers the project

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,600
managers

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,480
everyone involved feels uh this burden

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,320
and so we don't really have a lot of

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,919
language around this burden and so we

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,919
really wrote this talk

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,360
to be able to help people who have

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,120
worked in software development

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,600
understand ways to cope another part of

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,200
why software can be such a burden is the

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,720
idea of always be shipping

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,559
and this is something that many of you

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,559
have heard about and maybe

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,159
your manager or your manager who has

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,919
used this term

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,159
and this is the idea that if we're

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,039
always shifting features to users

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,559
then we are always justifying the reason

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,520
that our team exists

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,159
but the reality is that any system that

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,200
is always

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,880
on will fail and you have to take time

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,200
to take the system offline

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,120
and maintenance it give it a chance to

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,880
rest give it a chance

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,640
to be restored and i am before you right

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,799
now and we both

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,280
experience the degree of stress and that

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,000
stress if left unmanaged

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,640
will lead to burnout and burned out

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,679
people

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,679
burn out they burn down valuable things

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,280
but they also go outside of structures

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,080
that we set up for the team and for the

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,000
company

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,080
and maybe you've seen people burn down

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
code by introducing bugs when they

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,440
usually

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,240
have not done that or they start to

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,000
become

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,360
argumentative and they sometimes burn

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,640
down relationships with the people who

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,480
are on the team

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,640
and then they go out they go out of

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,039
communication tools like slack

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,880
or the documentation that the team is

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,520
using to track what we do

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,000
and you begin to see their contributions

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,520
begin

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,400
to slow down and trickle down over time

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,840
and so we really need to take stress and

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,080
managing seriously

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,360
and a big reason why we wrote this talk

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,440
is to do just that

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,600
to present a really easy to use

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,080
framework because if you don't

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,600
handle stress then your team will begin

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,080
to be handled by it

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,679
and you'll see always be shipping turn

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,600
to always be slipping

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,240
as your team slips deadline after

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,240
deadline as they labor under the weight

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,080
of being burned out now this is

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,240
something that i'm happy to have my wife

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,000
here with me because she's going to go

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,520
some she's going to go over some of the

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,840
academic research behind burnout

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,120
thank you and one yes so really we have

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,159
an issue here and it's called the

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,919
burnout problem

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,679
now being married to someone who's built

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,840
enterprise software for more than two

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,559
decades and myself i used to work for

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,080
accenture and captain ernst young as a

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,400
information technologist

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,159
i've also seen firsthand the experience

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,200
of stress in this industry but also as

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,520
an academic

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,280
i see it as well so as a business

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,280
professor i've studied the research that

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,559
proves burn burnout isn't something that

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,120
only happens to my

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,799
family it's a com it's an issue that is

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,520
common to man

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,320
so before we go further let's define

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,240
burnout

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,240
we've looked at a number of academic and

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,600
contemporary resources to get a working

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,440
definition of burnout

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,520
and here's what we've come up with as

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,640
stated in the june 2016

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,039
issue of world psychiatry burnout is a

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,600
psychological syndrome emerging as

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,679
a prolonged response to chronic

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,760
interpersonal stressors on the job

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,200
now stressors are what cause stress

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,039
stress is what i feel

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,480
the three key dimensions of this

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,200
response are number one

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,159
an overwhelming feeling of exhaustion

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,720
number two

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,840
a feeling of cynicism and detachment

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,400
from the job

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,919
and third a sense of ineffectiveness and

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,640
a lack of accomplishment

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,360
so to put it simply burnout is the

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,600
ongoing feeling that today's resources

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,840
aren't enough to meet tomorrow's demands

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,679
we're here today to focus on how burnout

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,440
affects those who are part of

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,279
software development teams but it's a

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,120
problem that spans

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,799
multiple industries the three dimensions

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,279
of burnout let's kind of dig

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,480
deeper emotional exhaustion well this is

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,559
an overall

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,159
lack of energy in a sense that your

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,559
emotional resources are being

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,600
fully consumed by work that means that

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,200
when you come home

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,640
you feel like you have nothing left to

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
give to the things or the people that

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,919
you love

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,760
um depersonalization is the second one

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,320
this signifies an unfeeling

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,559
cynical or even impersonal response

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,240
toward the recipients of one service

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,159
this is like when you go to the hospital

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,720
to check on a friend and the nurse says

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,480
there's a broken arm in room two that

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,039
nurse has stopped seeing patients as

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,880
people

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,159
and just sees them as a problem to fix

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,200
and i've experienced that

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,159
myself while i was addressed as just a

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,000
problem like oh

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
you know the the stomach element there

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,799
in room three um

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
i have to give my stuff and go so you

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,200
gotta be careful with that and number

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,000
three

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,240
reduce personal accomplishment this is

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,039
marked by a tendency to evaluate oneself

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,640
negatively

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,159
particularly with regard to work with

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,880
clients you begin to be

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,240
overly critical of your work which leads

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,679
to self-criticism

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,720
which is no good now

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,679
widespread burnout how widespread is it

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,679
well a gallup workplace poll did a

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,240
three-part series last year on employees

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,559
burnout

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,279
it showed that burnout is a very common

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,720
problem

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,880
in fact 23 of 7

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,000
500 respondents reporting feeling burned

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,279
out at work

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,679
very often or always while 44

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,480
said they felt burned out sometimes that

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,400
means almost

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,000
two-thirds of full-time workers

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,840
experience some degree of burnout

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,600
you may be thinking well my team is

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,080
highly engaged how could they be burnt

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,240
up

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,240
surely they can't be we have hackathons

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,360
video consoles in the office we keep the

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,600
bar stock with beer

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,679
when we were all at work of course and

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,679
people love hanging out at the office

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,679
while engagement is often seen as the

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,679
opposite of burnout the university of

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,799
cambridge published an article

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,080
in february 2018 that showed even highly

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,799
engaged employees

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,960
are subject to burnout the article cited

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,559
a study published in 2018

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,960
by the career development international

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,120
journal which states interestingly many

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,400
employees appear to be optimally engaged

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,400
while they are burned out and

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,480
considering leaving the company

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,400
the article observed the highest

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,279
turnover intentions were reported by the

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,960
highly engaged exhausted group

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,799
higher than even the unengaged group

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,679
that might be commonly expected to be

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,000
eyeing an exit

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,200
so i can be highly engaged and exhausted

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,840
and want a way out

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,120
well why is this well there's an

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,360
individual cost to

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,840
out ignoring burnout can present

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,159
significant consequences to individuals

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,240
when we first gave this talk in april

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,279
2019 i can't believe it's been over a

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,360
year babe

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,919
in new york city there was no medical

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,159
diagnosis diagnosis for burnout however

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,679
in late may of 2019

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,760
the world health organization

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,799
reclassified burnout as a legitimate

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,600
diagnosis

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,279
the myoclinic has a list of symptoms

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,520
which include number one

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,480
physical illness like fatigue and high

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,480
blood pressure

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,679
we don't want that psychological

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,279
distress including

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,039
sadness irritability anger and rage i

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,480
like our little symbols for that

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,799
even though these are not good things

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,679
and of course lastly increase sick days

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,720
and visits to

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,000
emergency room these symptoms add up and

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,760
have real world

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,200
ramifications in addition to their

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,559
impact on our work

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,720
and our personal lives harvard business

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,279
school found in 2015 that workplace

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,919
stress

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,520
contributes up to eight percent of the

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,960
national spending on health care

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,679
if you don't happen to know how much

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,000
national spending on health care was in

00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:13,200
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,360
it's a 190 billion

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,360
dollars the biggest factor in these

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,480
costs high demands at work which

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,960
accounted for about

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,960
48 billion in spending furthermore

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,600
approximately 120

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,080
000 people die each year of stress at

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,679
work that's horrible we do not want that

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,760
now we want to make it clear that stress

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,840
and burnout are not the same thing

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,880
stress is one of the factors that can

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,039
lead to burnout

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,480
however it's clear that stress and those

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,640
who succumb to burnout

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,480
results in cost to directly impact the

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,559
bottom line of companies

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,679
given the cost of stress and burnout

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,000
it's not supposed

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,679
surprising that it's a problem that a

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,120
lot of people try to solve

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,039
and one will go over some of those

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,200
common solutions next

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,360
well when you think about the cost of

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,200
burnout right billions of dollars and

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,120
so many people who have died because of

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,679
burnout you almost when there's this

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,159
talk about burnout or about thanos

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,760
well the fact is that because burnout is

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,159
such a common problem

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,440
many people both as a set of

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,360
corporations and as

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,960
individuals have tried to solve the

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,720
problem and we found

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,799
in our research that these problems are

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,559
fairly common but they often come up

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,440
short so we're going to talk about both

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,279
uh in the next few slides so let's talk

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,120
about how corporations try to solve

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,640
burnout i've been very privileged as

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,600
someone who's worked in technology for

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,919
over 20 years

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,000
so i've gone to a lot of software

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,120
development companies i've been

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,559
to github in san francisco i've been to

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,200
mailchimp in atlanta i've

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,799
been to prezi in budapest and you go

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,120
into these offices and they're in these

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,679
magnificently designed buildings with

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,320
of steel and stone and glass and there's

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,720
often

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,799
these beautiful break rooms and there's

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,480
foosball tables and you can play table

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,000
tennis and all these amenities

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,320
that are there to help the people who

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,799
work there feel like royalty

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,840
but sometimes royalty winds up at the

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,399
red wedding

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,399
and no matter how plush your office is

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,640
when your team gets to that point

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,840
there's really not a lot that you can do

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,600
uh to get them

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,679
out of the damage of stress unless

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,720
you're very intentional about it

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,200
and the reality is that these amenities

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,240
and these techniques are often there

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,600
when times are good

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,080
but when we hit a recession or some

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600
downturn in the economy often these

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,919
things are the first things

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,799
that get cut and so we wanted to create

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,120
a framework

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,080
that was beyond what corporations would

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,480
do it had to be

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,080
effective but it had to be a way that

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,000
people without privilege

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,600
could access and take hold of these

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,600
techniques and so

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,600
uh we wanted to do something more than

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,880
what we've seen corporations do so

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
nigga's going to talk about how

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,600
individuals

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:56,399
try to mitigate stress and avoid burnout

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,039
i love this picture of course boots on

00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,200
the beach

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,039
i don't know but given the often

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,760
precarious availability of help from

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,440
their companies

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,200
individuals often try to come up with

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,039
their own solutions to burnout

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,960
however people are often bad at

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,480
effectively dealing with stress

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,360
meaning they actually don't solve the

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,159
problem we often go to excess by abusing

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,240
food drugs alcohol or we turn the

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,480
escapism by doing things like taking

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,159
exciting extravagant trips well those

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,640
aren't bad things

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,840
but how many of us actually love to

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,720
practice self-care

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,399
by taking a vacation but with our

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,679
current social media environment

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,000
even self-care becomes a performance

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,840
people are often unfortunately falling

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,120
off the grand canyon trying to get the

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,200
perfect selfie

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,760
for instagram and snapchat and that

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,799
really defeats the point we're trying to

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,200
um build and reinvigorate ourselves

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,640
but we work to show people how much

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,840
we're not working

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,080
also escapism usually requires access to

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,960
wealth that isn't available to everyone

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,960
in tech or in academia so some people

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,320
have the funds to go on these trips or

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,919
maybe others do not

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,080
so corporate efforts are often

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,960
undermined by concerns about the success

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,200
of the business

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,080
and individuals efforts often lack

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,320
efficacy

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,480
and accessibility so the solution to

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,799
burnout has to involve simple

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,399
and effective practices for managing

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,480
stress

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,799
as we look for a model for addressing

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,320
burnout in tech in other industries

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,000
we wanted a framework that would be

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,919
effective yet not require

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,840
privilege to access we found a

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,559
three-part plan that we've seen in our

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,919
own lives

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,919
as well as the lives of software

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,760
engineers we want this plan to be

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,559
accessible so they are geared around

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,240
practices

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,480
that individuals can immediately

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,880
implement with very little cost

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,240
however for each part of the model we

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,840
also have a point or two

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,600
for what companies can do given the

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,320
budget and if they have the willingness

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,200
to tackle

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,720
burnout it can't be ignored we have to

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,399
we have a lot to share about this

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,519
framework but we want to make sure we

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,080
specify

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,519
clear calls to action so in each part

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,159
we'll share something we call

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,000
the one thing you simply must do that we

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,399
think are best ways to start burning

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,960
down

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,559
burn out before we go into our model and

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,120
we'll give you some inspiration behind

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,559
it

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,480
right so i'm sure that many of you

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,640
watching this have used a burn down

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,159
chart but just to make sure we're all

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,320
using the same terminology i'm going to

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,399
quickly describe what a burn down chart

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,559
is now i'm an engineering manager and

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,080
i've also done work as a scrum master

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,519
and so it really comes from the world of

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,960
agile software development

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,799
so where burn down chart works is that

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,519
you have the horizontal

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,519
axis which is time you have the vertical

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,559
axis which is work and so the idea is

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,039
that over

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,559
a period of time this ideal line will

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,480
guide the team

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,640
showing what would happen at the team

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,120
perfectly burn down the work evenly

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,760
over the 10-day period as shown in this

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,760
example

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,840
and so we have the work and then we see

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,640
that as we do the work

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,840
we'll burn it down and that the work

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,919
left to be done

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,880
will hopefully become less as we go

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,720
throughout

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,279
the time period that we're trying to

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,519
specify in this 10-day cycle

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,640
usually referred to as a sprint and so

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,960
this work

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,399
becomes what we're trying to burn now

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,399
we're trying to burn down the work so

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,320
that by the time we're over

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,760
uh by the time the screen is over then

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,480
it's down to zero

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,800
now i've used a lot of burn down charts

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,639
with

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,000
many teams across multiple companies i'm

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,240
sure that many of you have

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,079
seen this some of you may go through it

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,000
every day during your daily stand up

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,599
but as i worked with burn down charts

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,079
and often work late at night looking at

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,560
them

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,520
i realized that as an engineering

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,440
manager

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,119
who cares about my team but also as a

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,280
person i had to do more

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,800
than burn down work i realized that

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,679
there are certain things i needed to

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,520
burn down

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,960
to deal with the stress that my team was

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,679
under and that was

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,760
really the model uh and really the thing

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,960
that was the inspiration for this talk

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,119
that we needed to burn

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,159
down certain things just like we burned

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,320
down work

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,359
uh and that's really how we came up with

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,760
this talk

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,480
and so a lot of what we try to do in

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,200
this toggle

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,160
is be very action-oriented uh to make

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,839
sure that

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,480
everyone can have things that they can

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,640
take even right after this talk is done

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,880
and begin implementing into your daily

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,880
life

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,880
burning down barriers i love this

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,480
picture eye contact is so powerful

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,079
and so meaningful as human beings we

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,359
want to make sure that we have people we

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,320
look them in the eye i know it's

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,320
difficult

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,000
um with all these zoom meetings but just

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,079
that human connection is

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,760
really important so we all need a

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,960
network of people who will walk through

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,200
our lives with us

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,480
human beings are actually built for

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,320
relationships that's why when

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,920
unfortunately if someone goes to prison

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,240
one of the worst things that they can do

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,200
to you is put you in isolations we need

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,520
other people

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,040
so it becomes cliche but if you want to

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,119
go fast go alone

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,119
but if you want to go far let's go

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,359
together in our research into burnout

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,000
we've seen human relationships cited

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,839
as a key way to protect against burnout

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,760
as members of software development teams

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,320
it's vital to burn down barriers between

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,320
you

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,000
and the people you work with you should

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,839
also foster an environment of open

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,480
discussion where every team member feels

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,960
empowered

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,800
to share their ideas even if you're not

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,720
the manager you should also recognize

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,280
good work ideally immediately after it

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,040
occurs

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,800
however make sure you know how each team

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,480
member likes to be recognized

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,400
some people may want it done privately

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,240
while others don't mind public praise

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,079
also some prefer written recognition

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,640
while others want it to be said

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,160
verbally there are low-cost ways to

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,800
strengthen your relationships with your

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,200
teams

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,359
but companies can also help they can

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,920
incentivize socializing around shared

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,560
interest

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,640
or companies can give out gift cards

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,640
that can only be used if two or three

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,760
or more people take part in the purchase

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,240
or the activity

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,839
so the one thing you simply must do is

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,480
have regular meetings with people in

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,320
person

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,839
this can be anywhere like in a coffee

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,359
shop a restaurant or park

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,960
but it should be at least once a month

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,200
and with cobia 19

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,560
then of course perhaps a park is a good

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,440
idea because you can easily kind of

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,960
space out and

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,040
everybody bring their own food that

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,880
would be nice pick the one thing that is

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,720
causing you the most stress in your life

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,320
and share with the people in that group

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,920
while they may not be able to solve the

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,480
problem they can offer support

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,920
and sympathy and one will cover burning

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,040
down distractions yeah i'm going to

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,960
cover that i just want to linger a

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,800
little bit here because burning down

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,720
barriers and building up relationships

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,760
is so important i want to share a word

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,359
for introverts

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,760
if you're introvert like me where you

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,520
recharge in solitude and

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,760
you really can be drained by being

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,200
around people even people like us people

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,640
who are introverts we need these

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,320
connections we need

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,760
to have someone who's walking through

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,520
life with us so i really want to

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,040
spend time as we go through this first

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,440
part of our three-part

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,119
framework really doubling down on this

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,280
idea that we need to have

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,599
connections with other humans in order

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,960
to really properly manage stress

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,800
all right the second part of our

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,720
framework is what we call

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,560
burning down distractions and that's

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,720
harnessing the power of focus

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,079
to truly get things done you know we

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,320
live in a world where there's

00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,320
always things distracting us there are

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,079
notifications on our phones and

00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,440
people can contact us in so many ways

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,839
either calling us

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,200
texting us seeing an email walking up

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:06,480
and talking to us

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,119
and it can be so distracting

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,000
having those interruptions and it really

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,280
blinds us to

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,839
the truth that our attention is finite

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,359
we only have so much attention that we

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,520
can spend throughout a day

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,960
and if you're not careful you can not

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,880
even get to the end of your day

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,480
but have your attention totally drained

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,440
away so that when there's things that

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,520
come your way

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,280
you don't even have the resources to

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,760
address them and the really

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,200
the key to this the key to burning down

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,160
distractions is really

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,960
simple power of no we have to be willing

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,960
to tell people

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,960
no that's not something that i can work

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,280
on right now or even

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,480
to social media no i'm not going to

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,640
check you right now

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,880
because i need to harness my attention

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,640
right now every tweet that we read every

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,800
instagram post that we like

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,680
knicks away and ticks away at our

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,839
attention

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,200
and it's really important to really get

00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,200
to the power of this

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,400
that we have to identify what's really

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,160
valuable to me

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,720
what really is important in my life

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,880
and by doing that by really focusing on

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,400
what we think is really valuable

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,880
that's the way that we can identify

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,760
those things and really get

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,440
our action and our attention lined up

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,280
with making a difference in those areas

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,160
so just take some time right now even as

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,240
you're watching

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,440
this think about what's really valuable

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,040
to me and

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,480
if you think about it it's probably not

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,480
20 or 30 things

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,680
even though your task list may be 20 or

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,839
30 things long

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,440
it's probably one or two and so we

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,920
really have to do the work

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,720
of narrowing down what are our core

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,240
values

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,160
and making sure that we give our

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,800
attention enough space

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,520
to progress those values and make them

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,440
real

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,640
now the one thing that you simply must

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,520
do to make

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,040
a real dent is to get off social media

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,400
and i know that that's a lot to say that

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
some people may have fallen on your

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,200
chair

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,839
but yes i recommend getting off of

00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,400
social media but if you can't do that

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,680
at least take a fast from it i recommend

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,599
at least a month

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,839
uninstall the social media apps from

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,920
your phone and you will be amazed

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,000
at how much of your attention you get

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,800
back that your attention is not

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,079
being drained by tweets and retweets and

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,720
comments and likes

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,680
but you'll be able to harness that freed

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,440
up attention

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,359
to really make a difference and to

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,640
really get the values that you hold

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,200
there

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,640
progress and make them real so uh even

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,119
if that's not

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,040
even that's too much right even if a one

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,319
month fast i would say at least put into

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,520
a time box

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,520
and say okay only between 10 a.m and 11

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,359
a.m or whatever hour period works

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,800
i'm going to get my social media fix and

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,079
then i'm not going to shake it again

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,000
until the next day

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,440
and i'm really trying to simplify it now

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,400
because i really

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,040
think people underestimate how much we

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,720
lose out

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,079
by always being on social media and so

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
that's one thing that i really encourage

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,640
you to do

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,640
in order to get your attention back

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,280
yoga love that sunrise sunset

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,160
beautiful so the our next point is

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,040
burning down

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,079
illness and a focus on health software

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,560
developers are

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,000
often trade health for productivity

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,000
productive people do

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,160
but this often results in a future loss

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,880
of productivity that outweighs

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,520
whatever was temporarily gained burnout

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,920
takes a

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,680
physical toll on our bodies on our

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,760
mental and physical health

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,520
but if we improve our health then we can

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,240
build up resistance the effects of

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,560
burnout

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,240
this includes getting adequate sleep and

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,160
staying hydrated throughout the day

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,240
especially in texas where we live

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,520
we have to make sure we we have that

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,319
water and that we're taking care of

00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,400
ourselves

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,640
it's also important to get regular

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,160
exercise and improve our nutrition

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,079
companies can contribute to the health

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,800
of their employees by doing yoga in the

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,960
office

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,160
paying for gym memberships and giving

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,640
people mandatory

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,800
no work times each week these no work

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,640
time shouldn't come from their vacation

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,480
and while they don't have to go to the

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,240
gym they should be encouraged to do so

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,960
so i like the network times where we

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,680
might say

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,319
from six to nine you know no emails no

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,040
no phone

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,079
no work just you know engage focus time

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,160
with the family

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,200
so the one thing you simply must do take

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,119
walks

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,880
working out often requires a fair amount

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,960
of privilege to get access to weights

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,720
and gym equipment working out can be

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,680
time consuming but most of us can take a

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,400
walk and for me

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,960
when i was doing my um dissertation at

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,119
texas a

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,400
m university pursuing my phd and i got

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,160
really really stressed because i want to

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,480
do such a good job

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,920
i started implementing walks out in the

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,680
evenings and it's just a part of our

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,079
life and everyone and i walk together

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,880
almost every single day so we can start

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,800
small

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,040
walk around the block once a day maybe

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,720
after dinner walking is free it's a

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,000
simple way to invest in your health and

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,760
burn down illness

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,599
we've covered a lot and then we'll talk

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,880
about how to balance everything out

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,240
you know i just want to go back to this

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,920
burn down chart because one of my

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,319
favorite features of a burn down chart

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,520
is this ideal line right it represents

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,640
perfection

00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,160
but i don't want people to get

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,280
bogged down by perfection you might be

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,760
thinking okay this is a three-part

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,160
framework

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,319
it's really simple it's my relationships

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,240
it's my focus and it's my health

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,000
but even though this framework is really

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,079
simple and we believe it's powerful

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,599
you can get burned out worrying about

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,319
burnout and we don't want that to happen

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,319
to you

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,920
and so what this means is that with the

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,319
with the ideal line

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,000
one thing i realized having led many

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,880
teams across many sprints

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,440
is that i don't get hung up if the aldo

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,680
line

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,720
is not where i wanted to be right maybe

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,720
we are a little bit

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,079
higher than we like to be and we're not

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
where we want to be with brittany on the

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,800
work but

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,800
i know that there's a tolerance range

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,680
where i know that my team has time to

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,440
recover

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,680
before the sprint ends and so there will

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,280
be times in your life where you're not

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,839
perfectly managing the stress in your

00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,680
life

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,440
you're not maybe meeting with people the

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,680
way that you like to or maybe you

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,119
skip a couple weeks at the gym or maybe

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,440
you just

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,240
are binging on social media well that's

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,800
okay

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,040
as long as you take regular intervals

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,680
and regular checkpoints with yourself

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,319
and say okay things are where i want

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,160
them to be

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,079
and i need to make sure that i get back

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,440
into working out i'm gonna take those

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,920
walks that i started doing

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,800
so well for several weeks until i fell

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,400
off and

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,800
it's really key to have those regular

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,520
checkpoints maybe once a week or once a

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,560
month

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,599
and maybe with a partner to walk through

00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,359
this together

00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,800
but you want to have those checkpoints

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,359
and so don't be

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,800
too worried about not being perfect it's

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,359
really the practices

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,079
that we're trying to enable you to take

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,079
hold of today

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,000
so i just want to go into the fact that

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,160
again

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
the practices are really what matters

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,880
and i like this picture because it shows

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,960
that this

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,960
these rocks are our balance and it's

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,280
really a balancing act

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,880
uh you won't ever be able to balance the

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,800
structures in your life

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,079
but that shouldn't be your goal your

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,760
goal should be to know

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:58,480
when am i outside of my stress tolerance

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,200
when am i outside of this three-part

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,200
framework

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,280
and that and you really make space and

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,440
time to get back on track

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,200
and so again those regular check-ins are

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,119
really so so important

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,359
and you don't have to perfectly manage

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,040
the stress that you have in your life

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,720
you have to be committed to regular

00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,920
practices that protect your

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,839
relationships

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,839
your attention and your health

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,560
now um i have a couple of things that we

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,480
put together and i think and i'm going

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,079
to go through these and that's me

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,000
and that's really what you do when there

00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,000
are scarce resources y'all

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,200
and juan and nika it's great that you've

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,240
shared with us

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,280
these three-part framework items and yep

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,760
i can see how

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,040
they are actionable but what do we do

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,880
when i don't have

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,560
even enough to do that and so we have a

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,079
couple of slides i'm gonna go through

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,240
the first two gonna do the last

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,760
one going through this framework what

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,960
can we do

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,599
uh to really put boots on the ground and

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,640
make

00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,839
progress so you might be saying hey

00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,599
and again i mentioned this i'm an

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,720
introvert or i just don't have access to

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,400
a lot of people

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,640
maybe i live in the area where i don't

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,839
even feel safe going out and meeting

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,560
with people

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,079
at a coffee shop or something well if

00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,720
you're an introvert or if you don't have

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,880
easy access to people one simple thing

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,839
that you can do if you have scarcity of

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,560
people around you

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,680
is to volunteer and that means that you

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,280
find a cause

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,760
that really speaks to you that makes

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,240
your heart sing and then you find

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,200
those like-minded individuals who are

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,440
organizing to make that cause a reality

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,240
and you can usually find these online

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,119
or maybe if you do have in your local

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,079
neighborhood

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,280
access but i highly recommend joining

00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,920
this group and a lot of groups are

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,760
meeting

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,440
virtually where you can even not have to

00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,200
leave your house and you can still

00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,599
take part you can take part in planning

00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,680
you can take part in brainstorming how

00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,440
you can make this call something uh that

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,280
becomes real and that you move forward

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,839
and i know that when i've been able to

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,640
volunteer and be able to engage in the

00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,319
community

00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,839
then you get the sense of belonging to

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,440
something bigger than yourself

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,960
uh and then not only that but then you

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,680
can connect with people who are also

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,400
engaged

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,319
in making that cause a reality and so

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,560
that can be extremely empowering

00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,440
uh as something to do so if you can't do

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,440
anything

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,440
get involved volunteering is a way to

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,359
almost get automatic relationships

00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,720
where you know that you have a shared

00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,400
interest with a group of people

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,160
all right so that's the first thing i

00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,079
think can put things where

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,359
you can pick it up now you may think

00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,680
well

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,480
yeah i understand that my attention is

00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,160
finite

00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,280
and you talk about social media you know

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,559
i don't think i have a social media

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,319
account because i

00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,599
stayed off that train a long time ago

00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,400
well good for you

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,520
but i think that one simple thing that

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,440
you can do

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,119
even if you have scarce resource is just

00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,960
journal and that's getting a pen

00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,800
and getting a paper a piece of paper or

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,839
a notebook and just writing down what's

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,520
happening to you

00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,880
and i really do recommend that you don't

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,800
type it out on your phone or

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,559
using a computer keyboard but you

00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,640
actually write because that

00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,040
the active writing actually reinforces

00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,400
memory and it helps you to

00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,319
really feel that you're getting things

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,800
out because one of the biggest things

00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,839
that

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,440
i really enjoy when i started journaling

00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,319
is getting things out of my head right

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,800
there's just so many

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,559
times when i have a lot in my head and

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,960
if i write it down then i don't have to

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,480
be

00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,319
afraid that i'm going to lose it and

00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,040
that's a powerful aspect

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,079
of journaling but one other aspect of

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,640
journaling that

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,839
is really part of how this practice is

00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,680
so powerful

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,280
is that i've gone back to journals that

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,480
i wrote years ago

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,359
and i look at the things that were

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,800
bothering me bothering me back then

00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,400
and i don't even really care about those

00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,319
things like that didn't even

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,000
become a problem or that was a lot

00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,400
bigger than i thought it would be

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,839
and by looking back on my past journal

00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,760
entries about my pain

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,400
that gives me hope that my current pain

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,720
will one day be as irrelevant that

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,559
i can see that this is going to be

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,599
something that will be worked out and so

00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,040
by having

00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,760
that almost literal physical backup of

00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,520
your brain

00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,200
in the form of journals gives you

00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,920
perspective on what's happening to you

00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,520
today

00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,119
and i think it's going to talk about the

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,920
simplicity that the simple thing that

00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,119
you can do

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,119
to take care of your health

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,040
well we have a big yellow screen here

00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,760
reminds me of big bird and a person

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,680
walking

00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,680
um so we're going to drill down on that

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,720
a little bit so taking walks like we

00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,480
talked about

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,760
um and some of you are thinking that

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,920
walks aren't enough

00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,520
um you have to work out and i agree with

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,280
that and i'm with that

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,040
and i agree that working out is crucial

00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,880
for good health um but it can be

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,800
intimidating you know do i use free

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,839
weights or use machines or do i stretch

00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,040
before or after

00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,800
do i do highways do i do low reps it's

00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,079
also easy to get distracted what's the

00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,240
first thing most of us

00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,160
do when we decide to start working out

00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,839
we might buy workout clothes or

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,160
i can't tell you how many times um

00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:50,079
people have purchased new shorts or

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,520
new shirts or workout gloves and all

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,240
kinds of gear when they say oh i'm going

00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,920
to start

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,839
working out and then all that stuff

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,359
unfortunately sometimes goes down to the

00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,040
bottom of the drawer

00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,720
after a few weeks i've never been able

00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,079
to have the time or find the time or

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,839
make the time to work out

00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,599
and so the cycle continues when i start

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,480
working out again and buying new clothes

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,160
and so forth

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,680
so working out often requires a fair

00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,599
amount of privilege to gain

00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,680
access to weights especially equipment

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,280
especially during copenhagen where a lot

00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,040
of gyms are closing down

00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,480
so let's just keep it simple again we

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,160
really want to encourage

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,000
something that's simple and easy and

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,920
that's taking walks now you need

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,359
clothes to walk outside of course but

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,280
you don't need to buy new workout

00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:29,040
clothes we want to start small

00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,960
so you might want to just walk around

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,400
the block you know maybe once a day

00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,240
after dinner it's free

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,520
and it's a simple way to invest in your

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,359
health and burn down illness

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,280
so as software developers most of you

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,760
have used a burnout chart to track your

00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,599
work

00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,359
so you already have this great metaphor

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,720
for managing stress and avoiding the

00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,319
dangers of burnout

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,079
if you use what we shared with you to

00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,319
protect your hearts

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,559
minds and bodies you'll be more

00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,079
productive and model better behavior for

00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,920
your colleagues at work

00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,280
as well as the people in your personal

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,280
people you live with

00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,280
building software requires motivated

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,680
individuals and reaching out

00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,400
removing distractions and revitalizing

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,400
yourself

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,240
will improve what you can deliver to

00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,839
your company as well as to your end

00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,400
users and your stakeholders

00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,760
and one and i believe that healthy teams

00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,760
make healthy code

00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,839
and burning down burnout will help you

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,839
be a healthy member of your team

00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:23,839
so we'll be rooting for you as you burn

00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:25,599
down the stressors in your life

00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,520
so that you can be the best version of

00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:30,240
yourself at work and also

00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,119
at home thank you so much for listening

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,280

again we are rooting for you we want to

00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,000
make sure that we continue the

00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,119
conversation so this is how you can find

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,359
those on twitter and

00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,200
instagram love a follow we love a

00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,640
connection and then we would also love

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,559
to continue to talk with you about how

00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,520
you can get the stress in your life

00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,319
in a managed state and avoid burnout all

00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,839
right everyone

00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,839
thanks again take care

00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,040
hi all right uh thank you both for that

00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,240
talk that was really great

00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,160
um and i know it's definitely you know

00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,680
applicable generally in tech but i

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,920
definitely feel like especially after

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,240
everything this year um

00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,720
you know there's a lot of burnt out just

00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,480
from even day-to-day life let alone work

00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:20,800
so um thank you both uh

00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,240
are they here i know they're here but

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,040
i just want to make sure their video

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,040
still comes up

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,680
hello we are here there we go there we

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,599
go okay

00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,599
we could not unmute ourselves but uh

00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:37,440
we're here yeah we are hello everyone

00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,720
hello hello um so thank you for joining

00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,760
us for our q a

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:44,000
um so one of the things i wanted to ask

00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,920
is i know i heard a lot of your

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,480
suggestions on getting off social media

00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,000
and

00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,599
you know one of the things i heard a lot

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,520
is quit watching the news because it's

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,440
incredibly stressful you mentioned

00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,520
a couple times going for walks do you

00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,200
have suggestions on how to remember to

00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,760
engage in these because i know sometimes

00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,359
like i

00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,920
i should go for a walk but you know

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,440
after a week i tend to just forget to do

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,559
it so sometimes things like this fall

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,160
through the cracks

00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,720
well i mean one thing for us is we

00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,400
actually overuse our phones probably we

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,079
put a reminder in our phone you know

00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,400
after dinner seven o'clock

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,079
go for a walk um we encourage one

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,880
another so if you have a neighbor or a

00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,400
friend that

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,800
you know lives near you if you can go

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,960
walking with them um that would be good

00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,000
and kind of um decompress and share your

00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,520
day with one another

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,119
i think it's a good thing yeah

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,960
absolutely i think that after a while

00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,040
once you put the practices in place

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,400
they become habits and you won't even

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,319
need the phone because you're getting

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,880
the benefits

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,599
yeah definitely um i also love that you

00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,160
mentioned

00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,640
uh volunteering and i know i've had some

00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,040
friends that wonder why i'm always

00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,400
involved in some volunteer type of

00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,800
activity all the time

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,240
but i know you anwan had said when you

00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,680
volunteer helps you feel great it helps

00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,280
you gain relationships

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,559
um do you have any good suggestions on

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,800
how to find a group or a non-profit or

00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,480
some other way to get involved with a

00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,640
group like that

00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,680
yeah a lot of them are you know are

00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,240
again if you're

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,599
have a faith base a link uh that you can

00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,760
find a probably a

00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,760
a synagogue or a mosque or a church in

00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,079
your area if you're that inclined

00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,440
that's a great way to get involved but

00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,640
you know there's a lot of great

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,640
technology groups i'm a big fan of black

00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,839
girls code which is a very

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,000
mission driven group they're a

00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:26,319
non-profit and they always

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,680
like people to donate equipment target

00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,760
mentor and they're

00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,800
utilizing zoom and other things like

00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,000
that and so

00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,440
um i think looking for non-profits in

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,520
the tech space because we're all

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,640
i think affiliate with technology that's

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,760
a great way to find a group to get

00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,559
involved with and probably find

00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,760
something that's aligned with what

00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,599
you're really passionate about

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,200
yeah and then maybe after and before

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,280
covett i know i used to also do a lot of

00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,200
volunteering for habitat for humanity

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,599
you know just when you help other people

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,440
you just take the focus all the

00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,960
ruminating that we may do you think

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,760
about other things and it just really

00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,720
promotes

00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,240
uh mental health for me it does yeah and

00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,559
i volunteered with the

00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,000
all-girls robotics team and since

00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,280
they're not meeting in person they can't

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,880
really build robots but they've been

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,400
trying to schedule all these things over

00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,319
zoom and with other things so it's kind

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,760
of cool that still the volunteering

00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:13,680
opportunities have

00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,280
kind of popped up through that um

00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,200
somebody had asked how do you suggest

00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,839
talking to your company about ways they

00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,599
can

00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,760
the company itself can help alleviate

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,319
the burnout

00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,000
you want to take that one um well i mean

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,839
one thing that's really important i mean

00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,440
i've been reading brene brown's um

00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,200
dare to lead and you know just having

00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,640
the uncomfortable conversations it may

00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,000
not be uncomfortable for some people

00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,079
really all depends on the culture

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
of the organization but if you have that

00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,079
psychological safety with your

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,119
um peers and with your subordinates then

00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,280
i feel that

00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,559
um sharing something like that hopefully

00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,119
should be palatable

00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,960
and to be received but basically just

00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,000
like we believe that healthy teams build

00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,760
healthy code

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,760
you know it takes healthy people to be

00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,640
involved and to be productive and so

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,720
it's not that

00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,839
they're losing anything by investing in

00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,240
the health of their

00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,760
um employees or their team members it's

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,000
you're actually investing in them so

00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,599
they

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,280
can have be all they can be for

00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,280
themselves as well as for you

00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,400
and one yeah i mean i've been in a press

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,160
over development

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,760
so enterprise software development for

00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,240
uh for a very long time

00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,760
um and just like you should not feel shy

00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,640
about asking your manager about a hey i

00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,079
need more ram

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,079
or i need a faster computer to do my job

00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:24,079
taking consideration for your human body

00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,839
is part of doing your job

00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,520
and the ability to present the best

00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:30,000
version of yourself the most

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,559
balanced and with stress in the managed

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,480
state

00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,000
that will benefit the company and so i

00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,559
think that just like you would be asking

00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,079
to say that the physical tools that i

00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,079
have right now

00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,440
aren't really suitable to me doing my

00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,319
best work you should say

00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,720
look i'm i'm managing these items here

00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,880
uh

00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,160
that will help me bring my best self to

00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,480
work and hopefully

00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,520
if you frame it that way then your boss

00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,480
will see that

00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,280
as easy to approve as an upgrade in ram

00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,559
or adding

00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,240
more cpus or an ssd hard drive but i

00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,400
just want to say i'm just glad that you

00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,480
all would even accept or promote

00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,440
um a session like this because we need

00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,440
to normalize

00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,440
health and balance i mean i remember

00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,599
when i was a consultant i literally felt

00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,400
guilty asking to go have dinner at seven

00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,240
o'clock

00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,960
because they just wanted you to work

00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,119
constantly and i think just normalizing

00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,359
we have to eat we have to drink water we

00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,880
have to get enough sleep this is a part

00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,720
of the human experience and it seems

00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,160
weird saying that but i definitely

00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,079
remember being in a world where i

00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,160
literally felt guilty to just ask for

00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:32,480
the basic things i needed to

00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,520
be the healthy anika yeah and i

00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,440
definitely agree we

00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,119
we need actually more of these kinds of

00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,680
talks in a lot of our conferences and

00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,240
events

00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,240
um and in fact i've been trying to watch

00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,280
uh some of the faces on the talk

00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:47,680
on the call while um reading some of the

00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,799
slack comments and you know so much i

00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,240
kept seeing like

00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,000
oh my god i need this talk i need this

00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:55,119
talk i need this talk um

00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,599
so that's been great to see uh another

00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,440
question

00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,119
uh somebody had mentioned that they get

00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,559
a lot of stress from work it's things

00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,520
they can't control like a really high

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:03,760
workload

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,359
um management being fairly distrustful

00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,040
of them things like that

00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:08,400
uh do you have suggestions on how to

00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,240
start making progress

00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,359
on burnout prevention when you can't

00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:15,119
really interact with things like that

00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,480
um i think one thing that anyone and i

00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,119
talk a lot about is

00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,640
we talk about we use i guess timelines a

00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,880
lot so if you were to

00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,240
talk to your manager and you would say

00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,920
these are the things that i have to do

00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,680
then you would say okay these are the 10

00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,280
things that i have to do so in these few

00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,920
days and hours i would do this and i

00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,079
would do this

00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,760
and maybe if you walk them through it

00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,240
then maybe they would be able to come to

00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,920
the realization wow it is unrealistic

00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,359
that we're having you do all of this

00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,280
maybe we should cut off

00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:43,520
of these ten things you know eight and

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,319
nine so it will take some work the

00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,720
framing

00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:49,040
um always um you know address people

00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,160
with um dignity and respect but i'm sure

00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,280
everyone um

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,280
will but unless you let people know

00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,559
um what you're feeling and going through

00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,400
they may not know

00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,160
and you know an old adage that we hear

00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,880
is that you know the squeaky wheel gets

00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,000
the oil

00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:06,079
i mean that sounds kind of you know

00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
bizarre but it's the truth if you don't

00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,720
say it then they don't know and so we've

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,960
got to

00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,400
and i remember as a consultant i i had

00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,799
to you know

00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,599
get strong within myself and say hey you

00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,960
know i

00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,880
you know i have to go eat dinner you

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,640
know and not ask and just kind of like

00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,559
say it and it seems weird

00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,680
but a lot of the it depends on where you

00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,880
worked in the culture of the

00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,559
organization

00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,079
where um those things get those

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,520
conversations could be easier to have

00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,359
than others and one

00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,680
i think all that's good i think that if

00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,760
possible um

00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,960
before i say this your essential

00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,480
humanity

00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,920
and being treated with dignity and

00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,799
respect is not something that you should

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,559
have to ask for

00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,559
right that's something that as a human

00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,200
being you should get uh the reality is

00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,000
that we live

00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,559
in a capitalist society where often

00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,040
people

00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,480
are see are treated and viewed as simple

00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,200
resources and that's the unfortunate

00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,280
reality

00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,960
of where we where we live but what you

00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,680
can do is hopefully use that to you

00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:02,079
your advantage in the ideal world you'll

00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,400
have a track record of performance

01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,520
that is showing that you are a value to

01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,280
the organization

01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,200
and you can hopefully leverage that

01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,760
track record before you hit that burnout

01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,720
state

01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,480
and say look you know for me to continue

01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,359
doing these things and delivering at

01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,520
this level

01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:18,880
uh and meeting the things that you want

01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,480
me to do and something you have to

01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,319
appeal to people's egos

01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,319
uh and so these are things that i need

01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:26,400
these are the accommodations

01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,000
uh that i need to continue to be this

01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,319
person for you

01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,359
and often if you have that track record

01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,960
that you've established

01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,040
if you dig your well before you're

01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,559
thirsty then you'll be able to leverage

01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,559
that hopefully to get

01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,000
some accommodations for what you need

01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,480
absolutely

01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
all right thank you both very much for

01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,839
uh both your talk and

01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,440

01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,960

want to ask more questions they'll be

01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,319
around on slack if you're one of our

01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:57,839

all right thank you colin and welcome

01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,719
back everyone

01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:49,760
um hopefully you enjoyed the first

01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:51,520
breakout i jumped in real quick and saw

01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,199
some good conversations going there and

01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,760
you are always welcome to kind of hang

01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,600
out there

01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,040
or we also have a hallway truck you can

01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,120
stick in um

01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,440
some of us have remote jobs anyway but

01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,760
2020 has brought a lot of people

01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,960
uh to being remote now so when we don't

01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,480
see ourselves

01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,719
every day or see our co-workers every

01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,719
day um it makes a lot harder for

01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:11,760
us to see all of our co-workers as

01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,360
people and

01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,679
same thing for kind of our software's

01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,719
users and dr simmons mentioned in her

01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,320
talk that

01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,080
uh some things like that when we're

01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,760
burnt out it's hard for us to see some

01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,440
other people's humanity which i think is

01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,120
a good lead-in for our next talk from

01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,520
kristen siversky

01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,600
kristin's a product owning code writing

01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,360
design thinking people person

01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,800
that wants to make tech more meaningful

01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,960
and ethical in our world

01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,800
her easily excited high energy and

01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,480
deeply curious personality

01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,239
tosses her in a lot of directions and

01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,600
she enjoys the idea of bringing more of

01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,199
ourselves to her work

01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,040
when she's not at a computer which is

01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:46,800
rarely the case you can find her running

01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,640
around with her dog draining her energy

01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,760
in some gamer sport or continuing her

01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,600
stream of consciousness

01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,199
on twitter kristen's talk's called

01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,239
keeping it human swapping code for

01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:56,719
connections

01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:59,199
take it away kristen awesome thank you

01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:02,480
i'm gonna hit the share now

01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:05,520
hopefully that get the right screen too

01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:06,080
and all right so hopefully you can see

01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,159
my

01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,600
intro screen keeping it human stopping

01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:13,199
code for connections

01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,040
good to go uh i do want to warn that

01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:16,640
this discussion trying to put this at a

01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:19,840
half hour session was

01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,800
difficult so i'm uh i did try to do my

01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,199
best to capture

01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,000
not only my own story so you can see

01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,440
from my

01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,040
own example as a person that went

01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,400
through this what i

01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,719
what you could expect from trying to

01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:33,199
shift uh in your career but also

01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,880
why i wanted to shift in my career in my

01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:36,880
ever pursuit of

01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,480
keeping it human and bringing the most

01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,000
of myself to my roles

01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,600
what that can mean in our current

01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,640
industry so uh

01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,760
to help set some uh expectations i did

01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,040
give a bit

01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,360
of an outline so what are you about to

01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:52,320
hear you can expect to hear this talk

01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,760
uh a lot about career shifts as well as

01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:56,159
my own story as an example

01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:59,120
so i i didn't go like off the wall here

01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:00,400
with a billion role changes but i did do

01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,080
some that caught a lot of people off

01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,120
guard and i think that's the that's the

01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,719
reason why

01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,640
when i bring this stuff up in other

01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:08,000
circles people like oh i'm on the fence

01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,440
of this kind of change

01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,920
what can i expect and i get like

01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,600
messaging on the side of hey

01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,520
what else did you go through or what can

01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,360
i do with this so once i started to see

01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,800
more of that i was like well here i will

01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,560
put it on a platform we can talk about

01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,719
it uh and maybe this will

01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,960
scratch some more brains into thinking

01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:28,000
about exploring their own role changes

01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,440
and what that can mean for yourself um

01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,360
so the third bullet there is navigating

01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:33,600
status quo and the realities of our

01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,640
current you know our society our

01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,960
industry

01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:39,120
uh because you'll see in pretty critical

01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,360
times of my past where i've had to be

01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,800
i was faced with a make or break

01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,000
decision like okay you did all this

01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,760
stuff you did the work now

01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
pick what you're gonna do and stick with

01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,000
it so i want to talk a little bit

01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,560
about that and how that impacts us and

01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
that ability to be flexible in roles

01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,840
and ultimately i want this to start a

01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,600
conversation uh

01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,520
as my intro states and as you'll see in

01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,800
this in these slides i'm very

01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,600
extroverted i like connecting with

01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,760
people

01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,719
and if it means talking about things as

01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,640
an example

01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,080
that would make me very happy so you

01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,120
know find me on twitter and find me in

01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,719
the

01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,640
slack we can talk about this as much as

01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:15,040
we want what this will not be

01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,320
is a tip about each individual role i

01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,600
had i don't want to make this like a

01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,280
deep dive of like here's how to be a

01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,239
software dev here's how to be in design

01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,120
thinking like those are

01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,640
you're not going to get that in this

01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,400
talk you're also not going to get a

01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:26,080
truly deep dive in my experience

01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,480
nor is this a talk about where i've

01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,800
worked because it's more about the shift

01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,360
and

01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,480
the reality around that than where i

01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,400
worked or what

01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,920
and i also tried very hard to avoid long

01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,280
wind and tangents i

01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,880
you'll see a couple times in the slides

01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,520
where i'm i'm going to block myself from

01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,400
going off

01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:43,520
on deep end but i put parentheses

01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,840
disclaimer

01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,199
so that's the agenda uh we're gonna

01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,719
quickly go through my background just me

01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:51,199
personally see me as a little one

01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,880
um picking a path that impact of having

01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,400
to pick and choose like okay what do you

01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,800
do with your life and your career

01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,159
uh how i chose dev a big shift that

01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,120
happened later and then how i got the

01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,880
product life

01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:03,040
the core of this talk that i want is to

01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,480
focus on the faq section i know we have

01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,640
breakouts later but

01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,000
i've since in this whole journey

01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,159
surfaced a lot of questions that i get

01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,679
over the years that maybe i can just

01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:13,520
offer to you instead of you having to

01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,880
ask me uh because

01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,560
i think that's usually what people come

01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,760
talk to me about anyways um and then

01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,239
i'll just wrap up with

01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,600
a quick summary so let's get rolling

01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:23,920
okay so who the heck am i

01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,520
a quick background um i'm telling you

01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,000
this because i think it's important to

01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,920
know

01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,080
my personality type how someone like me

01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,199
navigates in the industry

01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,880
and how i choose roles and to see that a

01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:35,679
lot of the stuff people is very deeply

01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,520
ingrained

01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:39,040
so this is a snapshot of when i was

01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,000
seven and a half this was an easter

01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,159
morning

01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,360
uh i ju i'm running around my brothers i

01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:44,960
four older brothers they're running

01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,719
around behind me looking for eggs but

01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,800
i'm on the ground and completely

01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:50,400
pumped why because i got this little

01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,679
slip of paper in one of my eggs

01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,440
you can't read it i was going to show

01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,800
you the video i had this on video but it

01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,679
wouldn't have translated

01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,199
but on that piece of paper it says 15

01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,040
minutes on aol

01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:02,239
and i kid you not at seven and a half i

01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,239
just wanted nothing more

01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:06,400
was to like be near the internet be buy

01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:08,560
computers near devices so

01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:10,640
this is a deeply ingrained fascination

01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:14,080
that i've had since i was young

01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:16,800
that was at least my kind of beacon of

01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:18,560
i think i want careers or opportunities

01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,760
in this space or whatever lets me stay

01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:23,199
close to this

01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:25,440
and i'm grateful i had this because uh

01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:27,280
i i also tripped upon a really nice math

01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,719
teacher people thank your teachers they

01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,719
help you more than you know

01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:32,800
that guided me towards programming

01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,239
because she saw she's like okay you like

01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,239
a lot of people you like connecting with

01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:38,719
people you like computers and you like

01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,679
math i will avoid a whole tangent about

01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,679
math being

01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,520
related to good development by the way

01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:45,199
see tangent's not going to do it

01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,719
but i happen to like math because of the

01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:48,320
puzzles and so

01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:50,719
she guided me towards a programming

01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,480
class and to me i was like all right

01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,840
well i'll go try this out i really like

01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:56,880
being near these devices

01:19:53,840 --> 01:20:00,000
and people i'll tell you this right here

01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:01,679
was a game changer i took the sole

01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,280
programming class in high school i was

01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,760
about 14 or 15 when

01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,480
i played with visual basic and it was

01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,480
probably

01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,560
it was like the first time where i saw

01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:12,560
all of my interests coming together into

01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,800
one spot because i could make

01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,239
these dialog boxes and screens and i can

01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,400
add colors

01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:21,360
and i could then program it to do what i

01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:22,880
want with the patterns and the syntax so

01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,800
and just ultimately i'm thinking of like

01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,040
how can i make things that help people

01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,880
and put it online and all these other

01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:31,280
dreams that came to life in front of me

01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,400
through programming so that is what led

01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,719
me towards

01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,840
uh this whole like okay i guess i want

01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,199
to do programming

01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,199
um and i'm glad i had this because

01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:41,520
here's the next thing that we did

01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:42,880
society slams this at you when you're a

01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,080
teenager and says okay

01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:47,360
kid what do you want to do with your

01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:48,639
life and uh as someone who's

01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,400
like that's that's almost like putting

01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:51,679
the cage around me like okay well pick

01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,360
one thing hope you don't screw it up

01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,960
because you got to get this right

01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,639
and it's really hard to change like all

01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,679
these things permeated my mind as a

01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:59,840
teenager

01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:00,960
and i tried really hard to guide myself

01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,040
towards something

01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,000
but once again that same math teacher

01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,560
and man she

01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,920
she's helped me in my my life but she

01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,360
came up to me and was like hey

01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,679
so i know you're trying to decide on

01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,480
colleges uh have you thought about this

01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:14,080
one over here

01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,760
or that because i really thought i could

01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,360
only just do like i.t i thought it was

01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:19,920
gonna be like a vanilla course

01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,639
or sorry degree and that that was just

01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,199
my life now

01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:24,480
i'll be in i.t but fortunately she let

01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:26,080
me know about

01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,080
rochester institute technology which is

01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:30,320
out here in rochester where i live now

01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,920
and i ended up coming here for college

01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,960
and found a degree that had a bit of

01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,400
everything in it

01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,000
and so once again you can see in my

01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,120
personality type i'm trying to bring

01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,199
more to a hard decision that usually

01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,040
wants us to do like one

01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:44,639
so i managed to wiggle through that went

01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,159
to rit there's a proof

01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,840
i didn't buy that image sorry great

01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,880
images it's proof though i'm keeping the

01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,679
watermark

01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:53,440
and i got my two degrees uh and was like

01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,920
yay i know what i'd like to do in life

01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,280
but then

01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,800
boom again what one career path do you

01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:01,360
want and it's like oh

01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:03,760
okay once again i'm kind of stuck with

01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:06,800
uh picking and choosing so

01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,159
uh i ended up through my degree and

01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,320
everything i had behind me i

01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:11,679
went for software development right so

01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,520
my first foray

01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,960
into my career was in software

01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,719
development uh

01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,360
and i'm not saying this negatively by

01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:20,719
the way i kept as i kept repeating this

01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:23,040
uh presentation i was like is this

01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,880
coming off like i begrudgingly went into

01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:28,320
dev it's not the case at all it was

01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:29,760
once again going back into like 2010

01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,840
figuring out what can i do to bring the

01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,840
most of my humanity to a role

01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:36,000
and at the time the option from me

01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,920
seemed to be software development and so

01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,600
that was my new home and i loved it so

01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:41,520
this was me in 2013

01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,360
at uh breaking development that was the

01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,679
name of the conference at the time which

01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,040
then changed to beyond the desktop so

01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,880
this is nashville

01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:50,880
everyone trustingly put down their

01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,639
devices and let people take pictures

01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,000
like remember when we used to detach

01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,800
from our devices this is what you can

01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,840
get

01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,600
so this really embodied where i was in

01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,639
my career at this point i really felt

01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,480
at home like my homeostasis was here but

01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:08,159
at the same time i was in my second

01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:11,199
software uh job at this point

01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:12,639
and in that job i was able to bring a

01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:14,800
lot to the table uh

01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:15,679
because it i was a sole developer let me

01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,199
rephrase that

01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,960
because i was a sole developer at this

01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:20,639
second drop of my life i was able to

01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:24,000
bring a lot of me to the table

01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:25,520
because i had to solve problems for

01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,679
a national company that had clients all

01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:30,000
over the u.s but it was just me i was

01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,920
just building databases and

01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,679
uis to help connect and we were

01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,679
maintaining the in-house server

01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:37,440
and then at the end of the day i had to

01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:40,000
be the support person for

01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,360
everything i built as well which that

01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,360
scratch is a niche that i don't see as

01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:45,840
much in different software places that's

01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,880
that brought my keep it human to life in

01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:50,080
my coding job

01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:51,120
because i not only was having to do all

01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,360
those other pieces

01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:55,199
but to hear firsthand from the people

01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,480
themselves complaining about using your

01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:58,880
code that you built

01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,520
is an experience i think more of us

01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,080
should have

01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,920
and in that role that's when i realized

01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,480
ooh i really need to stay close to end

01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,880
users

01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,520
and close to customers and people and

01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,560
try to keep

01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:12,320
all of this as human as possible because

01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,840
it's very easy to splinter out and start

01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,120
getting in your silos and then

01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,280
next thing you know you're just building

01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,560
and coding which happened a lot

01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,320
there were a lot of times where i was

01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,199
just like building something and you

01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,760
know you lose

01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:24,880
you lose concept at the end goal and you

01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,600
just throw that code out you miss the

01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,159
mark

01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,360
so back to the point of like okay well i

01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,560
need to do something else in my career

01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,679
because that's what society tells you

01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,120
it's like you have to move forward keep

01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:35,520
moving forward so i was like okay i

01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:38,239
guess i go for senior developer

01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,800
and once again asterisks around tangents

01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,400
i'm

01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,159
i can make a whole presentation on what

01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,440
does senior mean what does that mean in

01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,199
this industry what are we saying to

01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,480
people when we put senior on things

01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:48,719
i'll avoid the tangent i just want to

01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:50,159
throw that out there as a bone to pick

01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,480
but either way i became a senior

01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:55,840
developer but then something

01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,440
happened that i did not plan a while

01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,520
design thinking training appeared

01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,880
so in my third role when i was a senior

01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,400
software developer

01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,800
my the company i worked for at the time

01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:08,159
decided to bring on a design thinking

01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:10,400
uh training and i lit up because

01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:12,239
thinking about back to my college degree

01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,920
and the fact that i found all these ways

01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,560
to blend all of my interest yet i still

01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,199
had to

01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,560
pick certain facets at a time i was like

01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,199
oh it felt like you're seeing your old

01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,040
hat you're like

01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,719
i could bring this old hat back and wear

01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,320
it and it's okay like we

01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,000
i didn't have to just leave that one

01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,520
behind so

01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,199
this all it was a three-day training i

01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,920
got very excited and for those of you

01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:32,480
that don't

01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:34,000
know what design thinking is uh this is

01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:37,280
a a still from the cooper

01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:40,000
professional education video they have

01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:42,239
crash courses on vimeo i do have to put

01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
a damper on real quick people

01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,679
uh cooper had to shut their doors this

01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,080
year because of kovid so

01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:49,360
you know as i sit and give this talk i

01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,960
know we're all here virtually and we're

01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:53,040
doing this and it's possible

01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,159
i do like to take a moment to really

01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,880
highlight the fact that we're in the

01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:57,760
middle of this

01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,960
wild time weird time and even some of

01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,719
the resources that you're seeing

01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,960
might not be available for a long time

01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,800
uh because of a pandemic so

01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,239
that's a bummer but you know in

01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,920
solidarity with the

01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:09,440
what they trained me on and how they

01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,280
impacted my career i was like well i'll

01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:13,440
give them a still from what i learned

01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:15,360
so this is a high-level view of this of

01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,880
the design thinking process

01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,480
it's essentially adding that research

01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,880
friction up front

01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:23,040
in the process so when you're going to

01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,719
start working on solutions or

01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:27,120
problems to solve you you want to focus

01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,320
on understanding the end users and the

01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:30,159
people involved

01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:32,320
so it understands a kind of loaded word

01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:33,520
right but it's empathizing getting into

01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,040
the shoes of and

01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,120
looking at their environment finding

01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,560
stories and then with those stories and

01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,920
those details you can start to envision

01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,360
this is where the sticky note stuff

01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,639
comes in you see people putting sticky

01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,320
notes and everything

01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:46,000
uh and then you get into prototyping so

01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:48,400
like that's when you start to actually

01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,600
get into code is that prototype phase to

01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,639
just make high

01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,000
level uh just tinker

01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:56,000
a bit with the idea that you have and

01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,520
you iterate because

01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,120
i'm just speaking for myself but a lot

01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,960
of my career and observing the world

01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,960
around me through the past decade

01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:05,199
it's a lot of like i have an idea code

01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,719
it and it's like okay well

01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:08,480
that's nice but you're missing a lot of

01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:10,320
in-between pieces and are you sure you

01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:12,480
know why you're coding this or

01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:14,159
who you're coding it for and it's all

01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:16,480
those big meaty

01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:17,679
purpose-driven questions that just get

01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,880
bypassed for the sake of

01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:22,159
move fast break things uh so anyways

01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,719
having this design they can come in

01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:26,080
was a breath of fresh air for me it

01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:27,360
brought me into this type of role and

01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,719
dynamic where you can

01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:31,040
work with people from across different

01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:33,440
departments and actually

01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,880
you know see how people think from a

01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:38,239
vantage point of sales

01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,840
versus engineering versus marketing and

01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:41,360
even your ceo like we had our ceo

01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,360
involved with these sessions

01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,400
and it was just really fun to get

01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,960
different ideas and

01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,639
hash this together and i think it really

01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,840
brings forward a north star for more

01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,840
people to align to

01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,040
and work cohesively together keep and

01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,440
human right

01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:56,800
um so this was the big shift though not

01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,719
to be a spoiler alert but

01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,560
this was when i was like oh i really

01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:02,480
like this um

01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,239
how can i infuse this more in my

01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,360
day-to-day how can i because i can't

01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:07,120
just cut this off now you can't just

01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:09,840
have this training and then cut this off

01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:11,360
and go back to normal unfortunately

01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,040
fortunately for me my company actually

01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:15,520
opened up a full-time role for this

01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:18,080
and i took it and let me tell you people

01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:20,000
were deeply confused when i went from

01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,360
all that time of building up my software

01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,400
dev cred to

01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:25,280
suddenly this stuff and i got a lot of

01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:28,560
this

01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:29,520
people were just like wait so you code

01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,000
but you're doing

01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,280
design thinking but you're not like the

01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,120
cognitive dissonance when you make a

01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,719
shift like this is strong

01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,719
and people are gonna look and ask a lot

01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,920
of questions and even worse they like to

01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,400
think that they know that you're not

01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,000
gonna

01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,760
like it got a lot of people that were

01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
like oh you'll get bored you'll

01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,840
you'll miss it you'll go back and that's

01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,600
to be expected right like if you know me

01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,840
and how much i enjoyed

01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,920
my software side the development side

01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,320
that's a fair assessment but

01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,920
you know what i wanted to do to counter

01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,679
all that is show people that i'm not

01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,760
leaving anything behind i'm not just

01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:03,920
dropping and running i'm bringing

01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,679
my software development with me into a

01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,960
new role to get to a different vantage

01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:08,480
point together

01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,719
uh and some of the highlights i don't

01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:11,120
have to really amplify it too much it's

01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:13,120
just

01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,639
here's what kind of happened i will

01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:16,159
disclaim they don't own

01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,840
these impacts like this wasn't just like

01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:18,800
because of me it was because of design

01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,840
thinking in this

01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,520
uh opportunity i did get to see scrum

01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,440
teams looking at who and why a little

01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,120
more consistently and not just jumping

01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,520
into the what and how they're building

01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,920
things

01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,920
at the user story level so even just

01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:35,120
peppering in some of this

01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,320
at the team level is oops is a is an

01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:39,040
improvement from

01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:40,400
the usual just build fast and product

01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,239
owners and businesses

01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,760
uh business folks around me were

01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:45,520
recognizing different strategies

01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,120
and instead of just jumping to oh that's

01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,159
the hottest thing to build or that's the

01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,239
most important

01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:51,199
they were able to stop and just put that

01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:53,360
friction up and

01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:55,360
ask and go wait are we doing this is

01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,480
this is this really the most important

01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:59,679
thing

01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,400
who why and again just repeating that

01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:02,560
kind of process

01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:04,159
same for sales and marketing instead of

01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:06,560
instead of waiting for a window

01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:07,840
to just place a product in and just say

01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,960
yeah you need this like

01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,320
i could tell there was different

01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,920
discussions that were listening for

01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,040
opportunities to solve problems in

01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,480
different ways

01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,400
and that even actually led to a lot of

01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,199
sales coming to our dev teams like hey i

01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,639
had this call

01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:20,639
and i was going to give them this

01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:21,520
product but then i thought what if we

01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,440
bring this over here

01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,440
with this feature and it started to help

01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:27,600
build a backlog for future

01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:29,520
implementations so it's not to make this

01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,920
out like this is a magical thing but it

01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:33,440
did impress me at the time of how much

01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,360
a little nudge in this direction makes a

01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,719
big difference um so that was

01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,480
and plus i got to have a lot of fun with

01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,320
it i got to switch over

01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,679
to a new realm and give talks from

01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,320
different angles instead of talking

01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,120
about

01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,800
you know my code editor or something

01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,440
cheesy in the dev side like i was able

01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,280
to

01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,719
go over and talk about why should you

01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:53,199
care about the human experience and i

01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:55,920
think because of that shift it let me

01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:56,639
bring an angle from my dev history on

01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,480
top of this

01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:59,679
very necessary you should care about the

01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:02,880
human experience

01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:05,520
uh and it was just a good time um

01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,719
all around unfortunately the company

01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,639
started taking a different angle

01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:10,159
and so i was kind of faced once again

01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:12,719
with you have to make a choice

01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:13,679
on another role you have to move on

01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,639
where are you going to go what are you

01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,320
going to do

01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,840
and i still again despite all this

01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,960
history of trying to bring the most of

01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,880
me into a role

01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,280
i still was like oh no do i go back to

01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,320
code do i stick to this design work what

01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:27,360
do i do

01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:28,639
and i ended up going with products so as

01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,320
i got to know product more

01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:31,600
and i assure you i can ask everyone in

01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:33,040
this room what product means them you're

01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:36,000
going to get a different answer

01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,719
uh but and i can also attest that for

01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,199
this reason

01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,320
there's memes for days on products uh or

01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:41,760
product people

01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,040
and i can tell you i can identify with

01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,000
each of these in a different day at any

01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,520
given point

01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,080
so yeah there's a lot to learn on the

01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:50,320
product side uh but for me

01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,679
i wanted to still have that role that

01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,440
let me bring in that

01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:55,280
quantitative quality of analysis that i

01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:56,800
got from my design thinking but also be

01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:00,000
close to the developer so i can

01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:02,400
keep that kind of that code

01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
dev day-to-day feeling as well and

01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,800
product ownership really gave me that

01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,120
opportunity

01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,000
so and it's the best of all my worlds

01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,480
just to

01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,040
kind of distill all that i'm still close

01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,440
to code

01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:15,120
i have multiple teams i work with that i

01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,679
get to see day to day how they ram into

01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,600
things

01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,040
i'm still among the developers i see how

01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,840
they think and dig into code

01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,880
or bugs and limitations i too i will

01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,400
joke in meetings where i'm like i'm

01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,040
putting on my dev hat just deal with me

01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,400
but

01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,400
if you go this path you're going to run

01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:30,880
into this issue with this service

01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,560
and so i can still bring all that in

01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,199
plus i'm also bringing in the fact that

01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,880
i didn't

01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:36,239
i didn't think about making my actual

01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,800
product level more

01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:40,639
tool efficient so i've been i've

01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:43,199
subsequently ended up building things

01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:43,679
for the product level that are solutions

01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:46,080
and

01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:46,880
that's kind of been a fun element of

01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,440
blending my

01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:51,600
two roles together even more so and as

01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:53,120
for the design thinking side of my past

01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,880
i'm still interviewing end users that's

01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,960
a big part of product ownership

01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,159
uh in gathering those stories like i

01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,760
literally like to go sit in our

01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:01,199
different departments and just be like

01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,960
what's your world like what do you do

01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:05,760
what do you need to make sure that we're

01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,639
i can be that bridge to our development

01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,600
and making sure that we're building the

01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:09,360
right things

01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,719
uh same with identifying personas and

01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,600
all that wonderful jazz of design

01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:13,520
thinking

01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,800
of making sure that you know who you're

01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:18,400
you're building for

01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:20,400
and finding that why so these are all

01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,000
this is all hopefully reassuring to

01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,360
folks if you are on that precipice

01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,520
of like i need to do something different

01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:27,679
that you don't leave this stuff behind

01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,920
that comes with you

01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:31,360
so i did want to leave at least you know

01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,320
the 10 minutes for the frequently asked

01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,199
questions section

01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:36,000
so hopefully by me giving these to you

01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:38,320
that will reduce

01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,199
the questions you have later for me but

01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,360
either way some

01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:42,400
main ones are uh let's say i'm

01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,639
considering a switch

01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:46,000
how might i decide it's a good idea and

01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:48,159
this is deeply personal i

01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
i don't feel comfortable saying yes it's

01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:52,239
a great idea like across the board

01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,760
it's to each their own but i do have

01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:55,679
some ways that i know

01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,880
i helped myself navigate whether this

01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,400
was the right idea

01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,239
so asking yourself like what the

01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,400
day-to-day change would be what

01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:04,320
what kind of goals are you looking for

01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,440
or what's making you want to get out of

01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,120
the role you're in

01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:08,560
really checking in with those motives to

01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,480
see you know

01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,080
is this is this being driven by

01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:14,639
something different or am i just

01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,760
bored am i you know i'm someone who gets

01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,360
a little bit

01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:18,719
uncomfortable when i'm too comfortable

01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,080
so it's another thing where i'm like

01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:22,080
okay i've been here long enough

01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:23,520
this is time to do something different

01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,719
so maybe that's something else that

01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,000
might be in the back

01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:27,920
as a motive that you don't you're not

01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,199
really recognizing and

01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,960
another one i think is important for

01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:32,560
this question is

01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:35,199
are you able to change your mind because

01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:36,880
some people they want to try this out

01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:38,239
and sometimes you might get into it and

01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,840
you realize

01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:41,280
and you might not be able to make any

01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,440
adjustment from there

01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:44,960
for instance if you're up and moving for

01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,880
a new role like

01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,239
i would weigh that that risk a little

01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,400
bit because i had the luxury of being in

01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:52,239
the same company they knew who i was

01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,360
they knew what i was interested like

01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:55,600
what my goals were so it wasn't like

01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:57,760
this jarring shift within the company

01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,119
uh so those are all little kind of

01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,600
warnings that i would ask you

01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:02,960
if you're on this path what's a

01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,000
misconception about product that you had

01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:06,320
as a developer

01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,560
and how that changed so because of my

01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:10,000
roles i didn't have a whole plethora of

01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,639
product owners so i don't have like this

01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,239
anecdotal evidence of one assumption

01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:16,239
but i did really have that kind of steve

01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:17,760
jobsy approach to product of like you

01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:19,520
got one person who just

01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,960
has a vision that they just want to see

01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,080
happen and i thought it was very

01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,560
individualistic

01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:25,199
so i was like oh well maybe you know

01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,280
each product

01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:29,119
owner really has hard visions that they

01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:30,239
just drive and now that i'm in the

01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:32,719
product space

01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:34,320
quite different i will i will note that

01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:35,440
it all depends on the size your company

01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,679
too and your structure

01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,800
but i personally see myself as more of a

01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:40,960
product coordinator

01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,560
i look over a lot of our platform needs

01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,159
and make sure that things are

01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,520
you know just moving along and fluidly

01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:46,000
staying aligned so that it's not just

01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,840
this

01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,119
ramming effect of different teams

01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,440
clashing together

01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:52,560
so um that one definitely i learned in

01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,159
real time

01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,639
very much a different thing than what i

01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:58,960
expected question three what skills did

01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:00,400
you pick up when you shifted a product

01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,320
i really wish i could tell you that i

01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:04,320
got better at writing short concise

01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:05,520
and sweet emails i think that that's

01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,960
something that really good product

01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,639
people are good at or just people in

01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,840
general that are especially remote now

01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:11,440
if you can write a really good email

01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:14,960
that gets the point across in a

01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:15,280
couple minutes bravo uh but the biggest

01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,040
one

01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:18,880
and this is one that i don't know if i

01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:20,000
would have gotten as a developer i think

01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,639
about that often

01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,719
not dying on every hill that is

01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:26,560
definitely a lesson from

01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:28,400
product that i've been forced to face

01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,639
because i feel like in my dev

01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,760
sphere of influence i was able to see

01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:34,159
whether it was a bug

01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:35,920
or a path i wanted to take with the code

01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:36,480
i had that control to just go do that

01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,520
thing

01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,440
and you could just be like yeah i'm

01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,960
gonna fix that and fix that bringing

01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:43,119
that attitude to products especially in

01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,480
a big company like mine is

01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:46,400
you have to watch it because then you

01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,760
could start you know burning out and

01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:50,239
wanting to take on everything

01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,840
uh and so that was that was a big lesson

01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:55,920
to watch for between these roles

01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,679
question four is what do you and don't

01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,800
you miss about your old roles

01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:03,199
okay so the big one is we i miss

01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:04,159
putting on my headphones finding a

01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:05,920
really good playlist

01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:08,000
and just getting lost in code that is

01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:10,960
something that you cannot replicate

01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,520
you can't i can't find a way to scratch

01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,440
that itch

01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,719
in different roles like that is one that

01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,440
if you still have that in your hole

01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:17,280
right now

01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,639
cherish that one because that's uh

01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,719
that's essentially what got me into

01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:22,320
software and why i was interested in it

01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:24,719
is because i found something where i can

01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:26,639
get lost in and with all my interests

01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,080
you know it was hard to cough that up

01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:29,520
but at the same time

01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,040
you i recognize that i don't want to do

01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,400
that every day though it's not something

01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,880
i need to do every day

01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,320
it's why i'm like okay cool i know i can

01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,159
go back to that i will always have code

01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:39,520
in my back pocket if i want to

01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:41,440
what else can i do to help wrangle

01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:43,520
people and focus on the human element

01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:45,360
and less of the code element

01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,560
question five what advice would you give

01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,800
yourself if you can go back

01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,400
when you decide to change career paths

01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,280
the biggest advice i can give is just

01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,639
pace yourself

01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:54,560
i think people think that these are

01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:56,560
little modest jumps

01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:58,239
from rolled roll it could even be within

01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:00,159
your own company like just

01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:02,000
pace yourself reset your expectations

01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:05,440
give yourself room to absorb

01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,800
what's going on i if you haven't gleaned

01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,320
yet i tend to be a little more fast

01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,600
paced and i get really eager

01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:13,600
to just take things on and run but

01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:15,760
this role change was it took time not

01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,239
only to set the expectations of everyone

01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,280
else

01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:18,560
but even just to get my own

01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,239
understanding of what i was going

01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,679
through on top of

01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:23,520
the reality check of being in a new

01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:24,159
company like all that stuff added up

01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,920
together

01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:27,520
and i wish i could just go back and say

01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,199
you're doing okay you don't have to have

01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,080
this mastered in two weeks like that's

01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:32,719
not even

01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:34,960
possibly realistic so uh just giving

01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:37,600
your yourself space to

01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,639
absorb those changes okay so i threw a

01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,320
lot at you

01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:42,320
i have it too long didn't read because i

01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,119
know that was there's a lot here it's a

01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,719
lot it's easy

01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:46,159
for me to meander on this one if

01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:47,679
anything stood out to you or you want to

01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:48,960
get deeper into any of these topics by

01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:50,960
all means come find me

01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,480
but here's my too long didn't read it's

01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:54,400
uh check the rules in your head

01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:56,239
because i'm hoping the takeaway from

01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,800
this talk is that you can see how often

01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:59,199
in my

01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,840
life i had to do this like i have to

01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:01,840
pick one

01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,360
i have to do this i have to do that now

01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,679
i go to senior now i do

01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,520
like there's a lot of robotic cues in my

01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:08,719
world in my career that i

01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,760
i kind of wish i could have checked them

01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:13,600
more and just tested them more

01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,880
especially since you know thinking back

01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,480
to the design thinking

01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,000
that was completely off the map i didn't

01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:20,320
plan that and that came in

01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,760
and it was just an opportunity to flex

01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,719
in a different way and take on a role in

01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,880
a different way

01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:26,000
so if you don't check those rules and

01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:28,320
you don't expand

01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,679
that you know that thinking in your mind

01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,960
you might miss stuff like that and say

01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:33,040
well that's nice but

01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,639
i'm a developer and then you're you're

01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:36,400
forever in that

01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,000
column when you could totally be doing

01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,119
other things altogether

01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,199
so double check that you're giving

01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:43,840
yourself space to explore those paths

01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:44,639
and find out what better suits you spot

01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,719
the lesson

01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:47,840
this one this i see this kind of

01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:49,280
snarkily because i feel like

01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:51,040
with this whole pandemic right now we're

01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,560
all in the middle of trying to figure

01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:54,000
out what the lesson with all this is

01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,880
like what can we take from this

01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,040
in this time into the future that isn't

01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:02,320
you know that is productive and helpful

01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:04,000
uh but pandemics aside if possible uh

01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,800
each role can give you a bit of a lesson

01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
to take forward

01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:08,000
because there's there's not a single

01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,760
role that i've had that i look back

01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,280
and think that was a waste of time right

01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,840
like that's i want to reduce that

01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,840
mindset

01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:15,280
that you drop these things and that

01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,880
nothing's relevant even between

01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,840
industries even if you switch industry i

01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,920
guarantee you

01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:21,520
you're gonna bring something from that

01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,679
last one over to the new one

01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:25,360
that will help you in some way it and

01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:27,360
that's back to if you spot that lesson

01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:28,800
and carry it

01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,320
uh just for example though i did want to

01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,080
add an example like the not dying on

01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:33,440
every hill that was my lesson right that

01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:36,400
was my most recent product

01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:37,679
last night as a concrete example of i

01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:39,199
would probably keep running into that

01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:40,800
problem if i didn't just go oh

01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:42,639
this is my thing this is i have to grow

01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:45,440
through this this is my thing so

01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:46,960
it helps you to uh unstick yourself as

01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,679
well so hopefully that

01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,480
is a way to spin a potentially not so

01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:53,199
fun experience

01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:54,320
into something positive for yourself

01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:56,320
nothing is forever

01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:57,840
uh if anything i think this past year

01:40:56,320 --> 01:41:00,320
has shown us a lot that

01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,600
what we thought is the normal forever is

01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:04,639
apparently not

01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:06,000
in it and i'm personally kind of uh

01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,199
the personality type that if the table's

01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,239
flipped i'm like what else can we throw

01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:10,320
in the air so

01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:11,920
nothing's forever lots of things are

01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,639
changing all the time especially in our

01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,360
industry

01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:16,719
especially in the world around us uh try

01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:20,000
not to lock yourself in

01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:21,280
uh i get that it's helpful for pushing

01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,760
yourself along and trying to stay

01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,080
focused

01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,760
in an industry that's full of options

01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:28,480
and distractions

01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,600
but just maybe ease up on that once

01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,920
you've got a path because you don't want

01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,000
to

01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:32,960
burden yourself with this is my life now

01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,480
oh and you

01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:38,000
start to spin nothing's forever

01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:39,920
i want to also raise the importance of

01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,480
knowing that okay i didn't like that

01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:43,760
so say some of you do heed some of this

01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,360
advice if it's even advice

01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:47,840
or you get inspired to go try something

01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,880
different uh it's okay to not like

01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,320
whatever you try

01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:52,239
if you get to that point and you're like

01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:55,280
oh just kidding this was not

01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:56,560
what i thought because you know with an

01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:58,080
asterisk around this

01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,040
you can't always tell what the role is

01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,480
going to be from the outside until

01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:02,239
you're in it you know like

01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:04,080
descriptions are tough you gotta really

01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:05,440
be in a place before you're like oh this

01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,679
is not what i thought

01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:09,199
my bad but that's good it's okay because

01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,960
knowing what you don't like to me is as

01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:11,760
art is arguably as good as knowing what

01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,760
you do like

01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,360
to help narrow down options for yourself

01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,360
in the future to

01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,400
keep yourself on a good path and then my

01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:20,560
ultimate takeaway

01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:21,440
my last slide here is look for some

01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:25,119
bigger boxes

01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:26,639
i uh i was able to successfully navigate

01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:28,560
of course through my you know i have

01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:30,159
privileges and just the the

01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,159
wonderful network of people i know too

01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:34,080
that always helps but just being able to

01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:34,560
push and challenge those notions of you

01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,639
have to be

01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:38,080
this and that includes only this and you

01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:39,280
can't bring this hat here

01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:41,440
because i'm living proof that if you

01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,719
kind of want to wiggle it in um

01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,000
you probably find a role for yourself

01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:44,800
somewhere along the lines to bring more

01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
of yourself

01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,760
and i think when we can bring more of

01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,199
ourselves that's back to the keep it

01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:52,080
human notion

01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:52,880
uh we're we're actually sharing more of

01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,719
uh

01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:56,560
there's more vantage points more of that

01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:58,560
inclusion around us and

01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,840
able to create much better solutions

01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:02,480
that speak to

01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,679
humans on the other side so look for

01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:06,560
those bigger boxes and

01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:07,679
ways to bring more of yourself all right

01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,199
that's all i got

01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:10,639
but thank you so much artifacts for

01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:11,360
having me i appreciate being able to

01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:12,880
have this talk

01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,800
especially after all the random

01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:17,520
conversations i've had in various

01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:18,719
dms about this so if anything struck you

01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,320
you can find me on twitter

01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:22,719
i am a stream of consciousness

01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,239
consciousness type so fair warning

01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,199
i'm not gonna you're not gonna be you're

01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:26,639
gonna make me feel bad if you're like

01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:28,560
she's too much it's uh

01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:31,600
just is what it is but either way here

01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:34,560
to help thank you

01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:36,080
um and thank you kristin we at artifacts

01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,679
appreciate having you as well

01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,920
um do you have a good pronunciation for

01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,600
your twitter name uh it's mine

01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,040
it's just kristen but in leet so it's

01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,840
not really pronunciation it's just my

01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,719
name and numbers

01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:48,159
i was kidding yeah i'm very literal on

01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:51,679
these i'm like maybe

01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:53,360
her five seven that's fine um one of the

01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:55,760
things i really liked was you mentioning

01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:57,199
about how changing roles are jobs always

01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,719
results in you taking something in the

01:43:57,199 --> 01:44:00,159
next position with you and one of the

01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:02,639
things i found is

01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:03,280
i call myself a polyglot engineer

01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:04,719
because i

01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:06,400
always it feels like at every job

01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:08,480
working in a different language or

01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:10,000
a totally different role and so i see a

01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:11,920
lot of that transition

01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,400
going from like the types of problems i

01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:16,480
might solve kind of carry over

01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:18,080
um and finding new ways to do things too

01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:20,639
so i really like that

01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,280
okay yeah do you think there's anything

01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:24,320
to be said

01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:25,360
for um maybe let's say a developer

01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:27,040
trying to get at least

01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:29,520
a little bit of a part in the product

01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:32,639
roles like you're shadowing a pm or

01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,639
you know or take on a

01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:36,000
that's that's i mean sorry to cut you

01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,760
off but i i see your head with that and

01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,840
like part of me says yes immediately

01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:41,600
because i mean at least personally i

01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,960
love when developers are like i want to

01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:45,760
get closer

01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:46,800
to the end user i want to see what

01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:48,080
they're dealing with and

01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,080
because more often that i'm used to

01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:51,280
developers who are like kristin i don't

01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:53,360
care about that

01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,880
i want to just code over here and i try

01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:58,159
to distill that as the po

01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:58,800
so uh thinking of my own software dev

01:44:58,159 --> 01:45:00,400
history

01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,800
i had to tell my boss at the time i was

01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,199
like i really like working with people

01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,800
so

01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:06,960
and i remember he was like really i was

01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:09,600
like oh wow i really thought that that

01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,880
was clear so don't assume that you're

01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,360
the people around you or the folks that

01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:13,360
let you

01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:14,400
work in different capacities know that

01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:16,560
you want to do that

01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:18,639
i would highly recommend that you just

01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,280
go talk to that manager or whomever and

01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,560
say

01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,719
i'm very interested in this what can we

01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,920
do because i i just personally would be

01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:26,000
very shocked if they're like

01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:27,679
nothing they're they can probably bring

01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,800
you into some user studies

01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:31,360
or whatever sort of uh research that

01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,760
they do

01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:35,199
and please by all means bring it closer

01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,520
to the code

01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:38,639
yeah yeah i've always appreciated at

01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,400
least at least like

01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:42,000
dabbling a little bit in the other areas

01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:44,159
just to be familiar with the other

01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,679
pieces are kind of going exactly

01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:46,880
um somebody had asked what do you think

01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:48,719
you would have done differently if you

01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:50,560
wanted to change roles but not within

01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:52,719
the same organization

01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,000
that one's trickier because i i honestly

01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:56,880
think i needed that

01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,280
internal trust to make that kind of gap

01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,800
because

01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:00,560
i kept thinking like could i have made

01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,400
that same bridge to another company

01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:04,400
without the backing that i had

01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,679
in my current company so i don't take

01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,600
that for granted i think that definitely

01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:10,000
makes it a smoother transition

01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:11,840
because i would have been knocking at

01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,360
doors or products saying hey i've been a

01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,560
software developer over here and all

01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,520
this but like i really want to do

01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,639
product and i think they would have been

01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:19,840
like

01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:21,119
so uh yeah there was that would have

01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,440
been a bit different but it's hard to

01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:24,080
say sometimes companies see what you

01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:26,239
bring

01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:28,320
just as a person too it's not so much

01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:30,159
your resume and bullets on it

01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:32,239
so i don't want to like make anyone

01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:34,480
think it's gonna be possible but

01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:35,280
it was definitely a smooth thing for me

01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,440
yeah

01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:39,360
um do you have any suggestions on

01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:42,080
exploring like these alternate paths

01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:43,840
without actually switching those roles

01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,800
yeah so i think it's a lot of just you

01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,239
have to do a little bit of your own

01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,080
homework and looking around of

01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:49,360
what those rules mean maybe it's just if

01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,119
you can ask people that are in your

01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:53,360
company like what's your day-to-day like

01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:54,239
uh what's i think shadow sessions are

01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,920
valid i

01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:57,679
in my company i'm at a bigger company

01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:58,639
but we do have people coming shadow and

01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,360
they're from completely different

01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:01,199
departments

01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:02,960
and that's fair and if you don't have

01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:05,520
something like that maybe

01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,000
start it start a way to start showing

01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,080
each other

01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,600
these different skill sets because if

01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,480
that means that you're bringing more of

01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,119
what you want to do

01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:13,840
in your heart for the for the role you

01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:15,920
have

01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,840
to the table that's a huge win you know

01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:19,760
i i personally think it's more draining

01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:21,440
to try and fit myself in a small box of

01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:23,760
like i'll just do only this

01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:25,199
that's a lot harder on me than being

01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,320
like oh can i go explore over here and

01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:29,679
see what i can do over here too

01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:31,280
no okay well so yeah just uh maybe just

01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,119
ask around or

01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:34,639
follow people on on social media i know

01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:37,360
i'm following like a very

01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:38,800
get back off of social media talk but i

01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,840
do think social media is extremely

01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,440
powerful for

01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,360
learning what you can expect these

01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:44,800
different roles so it can be a good tool

01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:48,000
for that

01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:49,440
yeah yeah um how do you notice if you're

01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,480
blocking your own growth like for

01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,920
example

01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:53,920
when those assumptions in your head

01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:56,000
don't really want to go away

01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,360
yeah that one's tricky because you know

01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,560
that's that's where i was having a hard

01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:01,280
time painting out this

01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:02,639
path because i kind of trust my gut

01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:05,600
though if there's a point where i

01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:07,280
really feel like i'm i'm being more held

01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,639
back or my hands are tied that's usually

01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:10,000
my tell of okay

01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:11,199
why do i feel this way is it is it

01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
because i just don't align with the

01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:13,600
style

01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,080
is that the process that's not letting

01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,679
me grow uh the the management the

01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:19,440
leadership

01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:21,040
so more often not i'm going to assume

01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,159
it's an external force that told me back

01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:25,280
more than myself

01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:26,719
but it's also i'm i'm still working on

01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,440
breaking that thought that i have to do

01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:29,600
one thing

01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:31,760
and do it you know forever and i think

01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,440
since i got past that point

01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,960
as a design thinking thing i've been

01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,520
much better at going like what else can

01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,080
i do

01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,719
and i will warn you not every place is

01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,239
up for that

01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:42,480
you got to find the right places that

01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:43,840
want you to be that person

01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:45,119
because you know when i work at a bigger

01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:46,000
company people are like stay in your

01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:48,960
lane you're supposed

01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,159
to do this but it's uh at the same time

01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,040
i think people in the end know that

01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,960
you're just trying to bring more of

01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:56,320
yourself in

01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:58,400
yeah uh were you able to inspire mentor

01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:00,080
any peers or co-workers along the way

01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:01,199
with your journey to consider these

01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:04,159
alternate passer

01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:05,119
roles uh not so much on the path just

01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:07,600
yet at least not

01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:09,119
like directly i haven't been asked like

01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:11,360
let's sit down and talk about roll

01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:13,599
uh shifts i think i did see light bulbs

01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:14,880
along the way of people going

01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:16,560
i'll never forget one one of my old

01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,440
co-workers i really looked up to him

01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,360
still do

01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,119
as a developer and i was like you're

01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:22,239
such a good coder this is so you're so

01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:24,159
good at what you do

01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:25,920
i remember he shot back he's like yeah

01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:27,440
but you can learn code

01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:28,880
he's like the other elements of like

01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:30,159
connecting business and people and all

01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:32,000
these other departments he's like that's

01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:33,520
a trickier thing and i was like

01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,119
so i think that turned on some light

01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:37,040
bulbs in my dev team of like

01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:38,480
it's not all just about code you know

01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,760
you got to kind of

01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:42,320
breathe a little bit bring in some

01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:46,400
humans here and and have more of these

01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:49,360
discussions about what else is going on

01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:50,320
all right um i think that's about it for

01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:53,360
q a

01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:55,679
so thank you kristen for that um

01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:56,800
we're going to take a 10 minute break

01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:59,520
and i think i'm

01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,480
reading that um during the break we'll

01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,480
also have a

01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:04,159
meditation session so i think a little

01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:06,719
bit of stretching and

01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:08,880
stuff like that too um so if you are a

01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:10,320

crochets cute animals and tries to

02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,800
watercolor

02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:48,560
she's going to let you know how you can

02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:55,840
support immigrant team members

02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:55,840
take it away eliza

02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:04,320
hi i'm anitzia and i'm going to talk

02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:07,040
today about supporting your immigrant

02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:09,520
team members

02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:10,960
i am an immigrant myself i moved to

02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:14,159
canada

02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:17,440
a little bit less than three years ago

02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:19,679
and i've been in vancouver bc ever since

02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:22,080
and i'm currently on my second canadian

02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:24,719
job i work in devops at clio

02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:26,719
which is a canadian company that builds

02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:29,760
software for lawyers

02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:31,920
and i wanted to talk about this topic

02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:34,480
because it's both my shared experience

02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,960
being an immigrant and working through

02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:37,119
that

02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:38,400
and also my experience of people

02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:40,960
supporting me through that

02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:42,000
and helping me get to where i am and

02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,599
thrive

02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,119
and i think a lot of those strategies

02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:47,520
and ideas might be useful for other

02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:51,040
people as well

02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:53,760
i would like to thank the organizers

02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:55,040
i think there is the organizing work

02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:58,159
that i should thank them for

02:01:55,040 --> 02:02:00,560
first that often invisible work that

02:01:58,159 --> 02:02:03,679
goes into making a conference happen

02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:05,920
of getting the speakers and or

02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:07,440
just like the timetables of everything

02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:10,159
and putting in a website

02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:10,560
and and getting folks interested and

02:02:10,159 --> 02:02:13,360
wanting

02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:14,000
to take part in it um and there's a lot

02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,599
of that

02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,920
and i know that because i sometimes

02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:19,040
organize conferences too

02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:20,880
[Music]

02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:22,719
but maybe predominantly i think i want

02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:24,800
to thank them for organizing a

02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:27,599
conference that's focusing

02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:28,960
on building communities in tech and how

02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:32,400
we communicate

02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:33,119
because we rarely get dedicated spaces

02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:37,360
for that

02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:39,760
that are so big and focused

02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:40,639
we we can get you know a side conference

02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:42,960
track

02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:44,960
maybe a presentation maybe a workshop

02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:48,320
but having this bigger conversation

02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:51,920
and having it be certain

02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:52,560
center stage um it's what's important

02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:56,159
for me

02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:59,119
so thank you for doing that i would

02:02:56,159 --> 02:03:00,239
also like to just point out that you

02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:02,960
know i'm an immigrant

02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:04,159
and i'm a woman and i work in tech and

02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:07,040
all of that makes my

02:03:04,159 --> 02:03:08,960
my experience helpful to understand

02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:11,520
certain contexts and relevant

02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:12,400
but there are many ways in which i am

02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:14,880
privileged

02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:16,320
so when you're thinking about supporting

02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:18,960
your team members

02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:20,800
try to understand where their situation

02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:23,520
is and try to talk to

02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:25,840
a more diverse group of people who have

02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,840
lived through this experience

02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:29,040
and maybe none of them have to be wise

02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:32,080
and european

02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:35,119
or cisgender or able-bodied

02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:36,159
um and have a pretty easy time coming to

02:03:35,119 --> 02:03:38,400
a new country without

02:03:36,159 --> 02:03:40,080
worrying about finding a job right away

02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:41,280
so just keep that at the back of your

02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:43,119
mind

02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:44,880
when i talk about it and mostly talk

02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:48,079
about my own experience

02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:50,000
and it would be great if you just

02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:51,440
reached out to other people or educated

02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,079
yourself more on other people's

02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:54,079
experiences

02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:58,320
i'm going to be talking about what

02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:01,679
immigration is

02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:02,960
why do people migrate um what it is like

02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:04,560
to be an immigrant

02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:06,000
in a new country and maybe some

02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:08,560
strategies that

02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,520
you could use if you're an immigrant um

02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:11,520
to

02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:13,760
try and find a place for yourself to

02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:15,760
thrive and i'm also going to talk about

02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:19,599
some strategies that

02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:22,079
if you are a team member of an immigrant

02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:23,119
you could think about using them to to

02:04:22,079 --> 02:04:26,159
support them

02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:27,520
and to have a stronger connection if any

02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:29,920
of those topics

02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:30,800
um makes you uncomfortable please make

02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:35,360
sure

02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:37,920
um you you're only watching this um talk

02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:39,119
if if it doesn't make you too

02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:42,000
uncomfortable

02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:42,320
and if it does just feel free to drop

02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,760
off

02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:48,159
i i won't mind i want you to be here

02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:48,880
um in a place that lets you learn and

02:04:48,159 --> 02:04:51,360
explore this

02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:52,000
topic and not be stressed about it or

02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:55,440
worry about

02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,440
anything triggering happening

02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:59,840
and i think the main thing i would like

02:04:58,239 --> 02:05:02,159
you to take away from this presentation

02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:04,719
is curiosity

02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:06,480
so curiosity is something that helps us

02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:09,520
connect as humans in general

02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:12,000
no matter in what situations we meet and

02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:13,520
how we interact with each other um and

02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,280
even if you don't know what to do

02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:17,360
or you've never done it before or you're

02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:19,360
not sure what someone's going through

02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:20,560
being curious and being there for them

02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:23,679
is going to help

02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:25,599
a lot more than knowing all those things

02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:28,639
so if nothing else try to be curious

02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:28,639
about their experience

02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:33,920
so what is immigration why do people do

02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:36,560
it

02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:37,920
immigration is moving um to a different

02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:41,360
country

02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:43,679
and essentially it's any move

02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:45,920
it's not only you know people moving for

02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:48,000
work or people moving for education

02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:49,040
it's it's anyone moving somewhere for a

02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,880
few years and

02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:52,320
and switching cultures and switching to

02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:56,159
contacts

02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:58,719
and immigration is especially

02:05:56,159 --> 02:06:00,320
visible in canada and in the united

02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:01,840
states because there are a lot of people

02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:04,320
who are migrants here

02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:05,599
if you look at canada there's ovens over

02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:09,440
seven and a half million

02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:11,119
of us and about 22 of the society is

02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:14,079
first generation immigrants

02:06:11,119 --> 02:06:16,079
and about 18 is second generation

02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:18,719
whereas in the us

02:06:16,079 --> 02:06:19,840
the percentages might be smaller but the

02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:22,079
number of people is

02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:23,599
way higher it's about 40 million people

02:06:22,079 --> 02:06:24,560
in the us who are first generation

02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:26,320
immigrants

02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:27,599
that's a lot of people and that means

02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:30,800
you probably

02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:33,119
are encountering some of them day-to-day

02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:34,719
and some of them might be your teammates

02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:37,679
or they might just be

02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:38,719
people you meet in various situations

02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:41,679
and

02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:42,719
it's not it's not a bad thing to notice

02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:44,320
that they're

02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:46,000
slightly different when it comes to the

02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:48,880
culture or

02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,760
the way they communicate it's perfectly

02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:52,239
natural to

02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:54,560
see that someone is an immigrant and

02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:58,239
maybe try to understand their experience

02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:59,840
and we as north americans the

02:06:58,239 --> 02:07:02,159
new immigrants and the established

02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:05,360
immigrants and the few generations

02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:07,199
in immigrants are

02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:08,960
sharing the experience of trying to

02:07:07,199 --> 02:07:11,040
understand our cultures and interacting

02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:14,079
with each other on a daily basis

02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:14,560
there's definitely a lot of us here and

02:07:14,079 --> 02:07:16,400
it's

02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:18,000
it's something that impacts a lot of

02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:19,760
people in the society and that's why i

02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:23,360
think it's important

02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:25,280
um there is often a lot of conversations

02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:27,520
around why people migrate

02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:28,719
and a lot of them focus on you know the

02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:30,239
opportunities the

02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:32,719
making more money they're having a

02:07:30,239 --> 02:07:33,520
better life and yeah fair that's that's

02:07:32,719 --> 02:07:35,599
important like

02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:37,280
a lot of people migrate because of that

02:07:35,599 --> 02:07:38,480
but try to remember that some people

02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:41,360
migrate because

02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:43,360
of safety they're not safe in the

02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:45,679
country or the situation they're in

02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:47,360
maybe they're facing persecution uh

02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:48,800
maybe they're economical issues or

02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:51,679
climate change issues

02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:53,280
that they have to move away from maybe

02:07:51,679 --> 02:07:54,159
some of them are here for opportunities

02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:56,400
not for themselves

02:07:54,159 --> 02:07:57,599
but for their children or other family

02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:59,679
members

02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:01,679
um and some of them like me are just

02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:04,239
here because they're curious

02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:06,079
there was really no reason why i moved

02:08:04,239 --> 02:08:07,440
to canada other than my partner being

02:08:06,079 --> 02:08:10,159
here and it was

02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:11,679
my choice that i made from a very

02:08:10,159 --> 02:08:12,800
comfortable place i could have just

02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:15,280
stayed in poland

02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:16,960
and i think my life would be great too

02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:19,280
um so it's not always

02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,880
about moving to somewhere that's better

02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:24,159
and also that better

02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:26,079
is not always defined simply by work or

02:08:24,159 --> 02:08:26,560
opportunities or making more money there

02:08:26,079 --> 02:08:28,960
are

02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:30,960
various reasons why people move um so

02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:32,320
try not to assume you know why they did

02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:36,079
it

02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:39,440
um and it's hard

02:08:36,079 --> 02:08:42,159
i have a lot to say about it so i'm

02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:43,920
going to try and be brief because we

02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:45,199
really want to focus on some solutions

02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:48,639
here and not just

02:08:45,199 --> 02:08:50,880
saying how hard it is to do it

02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:52,079
but keep that in mind it's it's

02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:54,560
switching cultures

02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:56,400
it's it's going somewhere that you don't

02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,760
have an established relationship with a

02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,800
lot of people you don't have a lot of

02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:01,840
work history

02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:04,560
you know in many ways that's freeing um

02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:05,679
but at the same time it puts that much

02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:08,560
more work

02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:09,440
on you to to just have the daily

02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:12,000
interactions

02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:13,679
that you're used to that were maybe so

02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,960
much easier in the culture that you were

02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:16,719
coming from

02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:19,119
um and often you have to do it in a

02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:21,280
different language and with people who

02:09:19,119 --> 02:09:23,199
notice that you look differently or you

02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:24,800
speak differently or there are so many

02:09:23,199 --> 02:09:26,480
things about you that

02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:28,639
they noticed that wouldn't have been

02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:32,400
something you have to think about

02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:35,679
in your previous context so it's hard

02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:37,040
and it's hard in different ways and

02:09:35,679 --> 02:09:39,760
different levels

02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:41,599
on anyone who's experiencing it but

02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:43,520
nevertheless don't assume

02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:44,800
that oh it's easier because this person

02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:46,880
is this and that

02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:48,239
or it's harder for that person because

02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:50,960
of something else

02:09:48,239 --> 02:09:51,840
um just try to see the person and not

02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:54,560
the system

02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:56,320
and get curious about why it might be

02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:58,400
particularly hard or maybe easier for

02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:02,000
them

02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:03,760
and just keep in mind it's still hard

02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,000
no matter if it's easy or not it's it's

02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:10,400
still a hard thing to do

02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:12,800
um the process is um

02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:13,520
very stressful and transactional you

02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:15,760
have to

02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:17,679
prove that you deserve to be in your new

02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:19,679
country and in different countries

02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:20,960
um it's a different cost and a different

02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:24,000
process but

02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:25,920
in general countries want

02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,599
immigrants that are going to benefit

02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:32,639
them and the culture the economy

02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:33,440
in many ways and this process is for us

02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:35,920
to prove

02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:36,800
that we deserve to be part of this new

02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:39,119
culture and

02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:40,719
we're not going to be a burden for the

02:10:39,119 --> 02:10:42,400
new culture

02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:44,159
one of the reasons you can be rejected

02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:46,800
in the immigration process is because

02:10:44,159 --> 02:10:47,520
you have medical issues and the country

02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:49,599
that

02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:51,520
is accepting you decides oh we don't

02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:53,040
want to bear that cost that's too high

02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:55,679
so we're not going to accept you in our

02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:57,520
country um and that's heartbreaking

02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:57,840
right because you can't actually control

02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:00,880
that

02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:02,079
in many cases so we're going through a

02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:05,119
process in which

02:11:02,079 --> 02:11:07,599
we have to document improve our skills

02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:08,400
our background our abilities why we want

02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:10,719
to do it

02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:13,040
that we know we can support ourselves

02:11:10,719 --> 02:11:15,760
that we deserve to be here

02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:16,960
um and that in itself is sometimes very

02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:18,960
dehumanizing

02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:20,560
even though at the end of the day it's

02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:24,800
humans who make those decisions

02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:27,920
for us um secondly it's very

02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:30,639
visibly impacting your well-being

02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:32,000
like this is my heart rate sorry this is

02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:35,840
my heart rate

02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:39,440
for the first year of my immigration

02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:41,440
journey um first when i was considering

02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:43,440
moving and then i decided and i had to

02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:44,800
tell it to my family

02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:46,880
and i was preparing and then they

02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:49,599
actually moved and

02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:51,199
it was very hard at first and my concept

02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:53,520
sort of got easier

02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:54,800
i was like oh maybe i will never get a

02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:57,520
job and i'll just stay

02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:58,400
home forever and i got stressful again

02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:01,520
because

02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:04,880
i'm not the kind of person who can live

02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:06,560
without a job um and it's

02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:08,400
it's visibly it wasn't physically

02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:09,520
impacting my mood and my interactions

02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:12,239
with my partner

02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:13,760
and just in general it was physically

02:12:12,239 --> 02:12:16,000
hard on my body

02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:17,520
it's not just something that's maybe

02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,560
stressful mentally hard

02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:21,760
it that stress actually has impact on

02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:24,880
your actual health

02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:26,320
so remember that any change

02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:28,719
can cause stress like this and

02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:32,000
immigration is no different

02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:35,040
um the process of immigration um

02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,320
is initially you might be very excited

02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:39,599
and very happy

02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:41,840
and you and you go and on that ride and

02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:43,840
you move somewhere and then you start

02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:45,679
experiencing things you didn't expect

02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:48,000
and then it gets harder

02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:50,480
and then you sort of get annoyed and

02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,320
angry and frustrated at the same time

02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:53,599
and it can go either way you can either

02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:55,360
break through that

02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:57,199
and then find a way to be happy in your

02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:57,920
country and find a way to be thriving

02:12:57,199 --> 02:13:01,840
there

02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:03,840
or in some cases it can just stay like

02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:05,520
that forever or get worse and then some

02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:06,639
people decide to move back to where they

02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:08,800
came from

02:13:06,639 --> 02:13:11,040
so you definitely want your team members

02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:13,360
to be on that first progression you want

02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:15,520
to even if they're frustrated even if

02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:16,880
if it's hard for them in the moment you

02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:18,400
want to help them get

02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:20,159
to that happy place where they can

02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:22,719
thrive and

02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:23,440
support other team members and just be

02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:26,719
themselves

02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:26,719
at work and be productive

02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:31,199
so even when you settle in those

02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:34,079
challenges just keep coming

02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:35,119
right you have that bank slater first

02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:38,000
which is great

02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:40,239
because yay freedom i don't have any bad

02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:42,239
history here i can just be myself

02:13:40,239 --> 02:13:44,880
but in being yourself comes with a lot

02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:47,360
of costs of proving who you are

02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:49,040
and then not understanding why people

02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:51,199
don't see it or they see certain things

02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:54,079
about you that you don't think are true

02:13:51,199 --> 02:13:54,560
um and just constantly struggling with

02:13:54,079 --> 02:13:56,320
that

02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:58,400
um so that blank slate is kind of a

02:13:56,320 --> 02:14:00,320
double-edged sword it's great

02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:02,320
but it's also very hard to establish

02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:03,840
yourself in a new country

02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:04,960
um and then even when you're

02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:06,400
establishing yourself when you're

02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:07,920
learning those things there are culture

02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:10,719
shocks coming

02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:12,159
and in my experience they're not ending

02:14:10,719 --> 02:14:15,199
i still find things that

02:14:12,159 --> 02:14:18,000
are shocking for me in canada um

02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:18,400
and i i've kind of accepted by now that

02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,920
they're

02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:21,840
never going to end and there's always

02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:25,040
going to be something

02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:27,119
um even when i left here and i read

02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:29,199
books and i've seen movies

02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:30,159
even even after a few years of being

02:14:29,199 --> 02:14:32,480
here

02:14:30,159 --> 02:14:34,639
there are still things in canada that

02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:38,079
shock me from time to time

02:14:34,639 --> 02:14:40,960
and then you never kind

02:14:38,079 --> 02:14:42,800
never really stop being homesick um and

02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:44,239
it can get more intense

02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:45,679
so you know you miss your family you

02:14:44,239 --> 02:14:46,560
miss your friends you miss things you

02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:48,159
like but then you

02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:50,159
might start missing things you never

02:14:48,159 --> 02:14:51,599
thought you would like like i said a

02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:54,000
missing folk culture

02:14:51,599 --> 02:14:56,880
and i started buying folk polish things

02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:00,079
that would never buy living in poland

02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:00,800
but now they're in my house just because

02:15:00,079 --> 02:15:03,679
that

02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:06,079
brings me closer to my culture but then

02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:09,920
even if i go back to my culture

02:15:06,079 --> 02:15:12,719
if i visit my family i'm an outsider

02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:14,480
and that has been a shocking experience

02:15:12,719 --> 02:15:16,560
for me because all these little changes

02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:18,719
that are accumulating in this process

02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:20,639
you don't really see them day to day and

02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:22,639
suddenly you go visit

02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:24,400
and a person in the store looks at you

02:15:22,639 --> 02:15:26,079
weird because you keep smiling at them

02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:28,159
and asking how are they doing

02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:29,760
which is not something you do in poland

02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:33,040
in a store

02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:34,719
um so there's some things you can do to

02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:36,880
to work through that some things i have

02:15:34,719 --> 02:15:39,280
them that helped me and i

02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:40,800
also know other immigrants that have

02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:44,239
went through that

02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:44,239
um first of all

02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:48,239
you have to kind of embrace the change

02:15:47,119 --> 02:15:50,159
and i'm not saying like

02:15:48,239 --> 02:15:51,679
you always have to be happy about it and

02:15:50,159 --> 02:15:54,000
you have to keep positive

02:15:51,679 --> 02:15:54,719
not going to be better days and worse

02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,480
days

02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:58,239
um but it's more about accepting that

02:15:56,480 --> 02:15:58,800
this is just going to be the states it's

02:15:58,239 --> 02:16:00,560
in

02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:02,000
i don't know maybe it ends after 20

02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:03,199
years of being in a country i haven't

02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,280
done that yet

02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:07,040
um but i would assume that for the time

02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:09,280
being like those issues you're

02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:10,400
you're experiencing are just going to be

02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:12,880
your left experience

02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:13,599
and finding strategies to work around

02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:16,480
them or

02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:16,880
maybe work through them and embrace them

02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:18,719
um

02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:20,000
are going to be much more impactful in a

02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:21,280
positive way than

02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,400
you know fighting against them and

02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:23,920
trying to change things there are

02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:24,960
certain things you can't change about a

02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:27,599
culture like

02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:29,360
i cannot change the fact that the tax is

02:16:27,599 --> 02:16:32,399
not included in price here

02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:33,599
no matter how much i missed that and how

02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:35,519
much it rotates me to

02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:36,639
do that mental math every time i pray

02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:38,080
for something

02:16:36,639 --> 02:16:39,760
that's something i can't change and i

02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:42,000
have to accept that

02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:43,679
um secondly try to build up your

02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,040
confidence like you've done something

02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:47,519
super hard

02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:48,559
you have moved countries um you've

02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:49,920
merged cultures

02:16:48,559 --> 02:16:52,080
you you see things that other people

02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:52,479
don't see because they irritate you but

02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:55,599
also

02:16:52,479 --> 02:16:56,960
because they're interesting and new um

02:16:55,599 --> 02:16:58,240
it's it's something that a lot of people

02:16:56,960 --> 02:16:59,280
around you haven't done like they've

02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:01,200
done similar things

02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:04,319
definitely they've challenged themselves

02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:06,240
but maybe not always to that extent

02:17:04,319 --> 02:17:07,439
you can prove you can learn things

02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:10,000
because

02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:11,439
what's harder than living countries

02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,200
working in new language in the new

02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:14,800
culture and struggling with that every

02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:17,280
day and having to learn

02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:19,439
how to communicate and and how to do

02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:21,519
your job in the middle of all of that

02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:24,240
on top of all that you have to also be a

02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:26,319
professional that performs in the job

02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:27,679
um and just notice how much you're

02:17:26,319 --> 02:17:30,080
changing and

02:17:27,679 --> 02:17:31,519
that you have done a lot of hard things

02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:33,040
one of them is figuring out the

02:17:31,519 --> 02:17:37,200
immigration system which is

02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:40,479
absolutely awful i think in any country

02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:42,479
but especially so and in the us as far

02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:44,639
as i know from my friends

02:17:42,479 --> 02:17:46,080
so try to remember that you've done

02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:48,240
something amazing

02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:49,840
and you're great and just build that

02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:52,000
confidence because

02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:53,120
immigration is a great thing for your

02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,599
growth and

02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:56,559
you've done a lot um and don't let

02:17:55,599 --> 02:18:00,000
anyone i'll

02:17:56,559 --> 02:18:02,000
tell you otherwise um

02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,599
then to get that strength and get that

02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,559
confidence try to find spaces for

02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:06,479
yourself

02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:08,960
spaces that have to do with your culture

02:18:06,479 --> 02:18:11,280
like friends who speak your language or

02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:12,960
food that tastes like food at home

02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:13,840
trying to find a space for your personal

02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:15,120
goals when

02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:17,359
you can work on something that has

02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:18,800
nothing to do with being an immigrant or

02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:19,519
being in this new culture or anything

02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:22,000
around

02:18:19,519 --> 02:18:23,519
growing that just growing your own

02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,559
interests and your own skills for

02:18:23,519 --> 02:18:27,439
yourself

02:18:24,559 --> 02:18:29,200
and having that core you that's maybe

02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:30,559
neither of the cultures of both of them

02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,319
at the same time

02:18:30,559 --> 02:18:33,679
and also try to find spaces in the new

02:18:32,319 --> 02:18:35,840
culture that will

02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:37,359
allow you to explore and ask questions

02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:40,160
in a safe way and also

02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:43,599
start understanding some of those tricky

02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:46,240
cultural differences that you are facing

02:18:43,599 --> 02:18:46,960
um but never forget to cultivate your

02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:49,920
quirks

02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:50,399
never forget those little things that

02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:52,080
you know

02:18:50,399 --> 02:18:53,519
maybe come from a culture or your family

02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:56,240
that make you you

02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:56,800
like not wearing shoes in the house is

02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:58,800
the thing

02:18:56,800 --> 02:19:00,240
that i always do i talk a lot about air

02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:01,200
pressure because that's what polish

02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:05,280
people do

02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:07,040
or i just did diminutives of any word

02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:08,559
um and if i don't have them in english i

02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:11,599
will switch to polish because

02:19:08,559 --> 02:19:15,439
i just communicate in that way a lot um

02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:17,920
those little quirks help you center

02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:19,519
yourself in like being you and what's

02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:21,040
you and you get to choose

02:19:19,519 --> 02:19:22,319
which ones you keep and which ones you

02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:23,519
change and which ones you accept from

02:19:22,319 --> 02:19:25,519
the new culture

02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:26,960
and it's for you to define your identity

02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:27,599
and for you to decide what you want to

02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:30,960
keep

02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:33,519
and what you want to change um be ready

02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:36,160
to make mistakes

02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:37,920
you got to make mistakes and i think

02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:39,120
it's important to learn how to recover

02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:41,599
from them more so than

02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:43,439
avoid making them um if you're just

02:19:41,599 --> 02:19:45,920
embarrassed and you said something silly

02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:46,479
try to just you know make it quick and

02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:48,479
sweet

02:19:46,479 --> 02:19:49,520
just say oh that was not what i meant

02:19:48,479 --> 02:19:52,319
that was silly

02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:53,359
haha move on um they're embarrassing

02:19:52,319 --> 02:19:55,840
they're uncomfortable

02:19:53,359 --> 02:19:56,880
but they're going to happen a lot like i

02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:59,680
mispronounce things

02:19:56,880 --> 02:20:01,040
all the time if it's something that you

02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:01,680
thought you understood but you actually

02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:04,640
didn't

02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:05,200
and it comes from a point of ignorance

02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:07,040
which means

02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:08,399
you just don't know as much as you knew

02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:11,600
about something just

02:20:08,399 --> 02:20:13,760
embrace that say i don't know ask people

02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:15,600
for help and learn it um that's going to

02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:16,000
help you grow much more than explaining

02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:17,359
oh

02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,439
you know i don't know because i'm from

02:20:17,359 --> 02:20:22,080
this culture and it's just

02:20:19,439 --> 02:20:23,760
it makes that conversation harder um and

02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:24,240
then thirdly there are situations in

02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:25,680
which

02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:27,359
maybe it's different your culture than

02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:30,880
the country came to

02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:32,640
um when you wronged someone um there's

02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:34,560
this verge to explain why you did that

02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:36,960
and why you misunderstood and

02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:38,000
i would just say yeah people know that

02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:39,840
they know you're from a different

02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,399
culture but also

02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:44,000
there is an impact that your actions had

02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:46,880
and it's more important to address

02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,560
that than to focus on discussing the

02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:51,680
cultural differences so

02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:53,120
you know try to make mistakes and

02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:56,080
iterate

02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:56,640
and not get hung up on them because that

02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:59,200
will

02:20:56,640 --> 02:21:00,080
just maybe grow that frustration or keep

02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:02,720
you

02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:04,560
from embracing the new culture and the

02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:08,160
situation you're in

02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:10,720
and lastly you are empowered

02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:12,479
to set expectations for your teammates

02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:16,080
um and just do that clearly

02:21:12,479 --> 02:21:17,359
like preferably as as early as possible

02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:19,600
talk to them about the way you want to

02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:20,399
communicate maybe some boundaries you

02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:21,760
have

02:21:20,399 --> 02:21:23,439
especially ones that they might not

02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:25,840
expect um

02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:26,640
and just just tell them this is what you

02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:28,560
expect and

02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:30,080
and you give them space to learn as they

02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:33,359
are giving you space to learn

02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:35,200
this new culture um and try to just

02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:37,760
make this relationship work over time

02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:40,160
and help them understand what you need

02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:41,840
um you can expect things from them too

02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:42,960
it's not only about you adjusting to the

02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:45,040
new culture

02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:46,880
and yes they can expect things from you

02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:49,040
and some of them are going to be

02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:50,960
people specific not culture specific so

02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:52,000
try to have that relationship defined

02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:53,520
early on

02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,319
and make sure that you're communicating

02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:59,600
clearly around those boundaries

02:21:56,319 --> 02:22:02,640
so speaking of your teammates um

02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:05,920
if you grew up in a culture um

02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:06,560
it's the way of life of of the group of

02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:09,040
people

02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:10,720
that you grew up with right it's very

02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:12,399
hard to see outside of that culture and

02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:14,000
i mean that's any culture like

02:22:12,399 --> 02:22:16,160
it was very hard for me to see outside

02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,600
of the polish culture it's not about

02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:19,680
being from a particular country it's

02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:22,720
more about we as humans

02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:23,760
grow up in cultures so when you grow up

02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:25,840
in a culture

02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:26,800
there are three main areas in which that

02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:30,080
culture

02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:32,000
is visible there's a language either

02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:34,080
a particular language or maybe an accent

02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,120
or maybe some specific grammar forms

02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:37,040
you're using

02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:38,240
there's the social system in which you

02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:40,479
grow up and you kind of

02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:42,399
assume this is the default for solving

02:22:40,479 --> 02:22:44,479
these kinds of social issues

02:22:42,399 --> 02:22:46,479
and then there are the customs and norms

02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:48,080
uh which is you know expecting certain

02:22:46,479 --> 02:22:50,960
behaviors in specific

02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:52,960
contexts so let me give you a few brief

02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:54,240
examples of how i experienced that as an

02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:58,000
immigrant

02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:58,720
um language is often a very interesting

02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,800
point of

02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:02,479
communication for me with other people

02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:03,439
because my accent is kind of

02:23:02,479 --> 02:23:05,840
non-descript

02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:07,280
and their instinct is to try to figure

02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:08,960
out where i'm from

02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:11,120
which i think most of the time is a

02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:12,319
positive thing but sometimes it kind of

02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:15,439
places me in some sort of

02:23:12,319 --> 02:23:16,880
hierarchy that they think of

02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:19,200
when they think of different countries

02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:19,760
and different cultures especially so in

02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:22,479
europe

02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:23,520
because in europe people have more

02:23:22,479 --> 02:23:25,840
prejudice

02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:26,800
about polish people and how we are like

02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:30,000
specifically

02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:32,560
less so in canada and the us um

02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,600
and i i wouldn't say that is a bad

02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:35,840
intention

02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:37,280
but that has a measurable impact on how

02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:38,720
i communicate with people and how they

02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:41,439
see me

02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:43,280
so when you notice yourself doing that

02:23:41,439 --> 02:23:44,000
just be aware of it i think is the most

02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:46,479
important thing

02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,399
even if you can't like you can't fix

02:23:46,479 --> 02:23:49,200
noticing things like it's not a thing to

02:23:48,399 --> 02:23:51,040
fix you just

02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:53,680
need to embrace the fact that you've

02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:55,920
noticed them and then try not to

02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:56,960
necessarily act on them right remind

02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:59,200
yourself that

02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:01,200
you make grammar mistakes too and that

02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:03,120
english is a very hard language and it's

02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:06,000
very different in different countries

02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:08,319
just be ready to answer questions to ask

02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:10,960
questions if you misunderstood someone

02:24:08,319 --> 02:24:11,600
be open to the fact that language is a

02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:14,080
frame

02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:16,319
that you have that for someone else is a

02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:18,960
frame that they have to grow into

02:24:16,319 --> 02:24:19,760
and it's always going to have some

02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:22,720
problems

02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:24,080
and just being open to questions and and

02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:26,720
providing

02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:28,240
resources for people to learn like my

02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:29,280
team provides it for me in the group

02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:31,680
chat where i ask

02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:33,200
questions all the time is going to help

02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:36,640
them grow

02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:37,840
um the other thing i mentioned is the

02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:39,840
social system

02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:41,200
for me the biggest example of that is

02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:43,280
the work environment

02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:44,640
in poland what's considered work

02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:47,359
environment is much

02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:48,560
more specific it's a full-time

02:24:47,359 --> 02:24:50,160
employment contract

02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:52,240
it has a certain assumption about

02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:54,960
vacation days overtime

02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:56,560
and whatnot and it's by law so it's not

02:24:54,960 --> 02:25:00,080
employer specific

02:24:56,560 --> 02:25:02,640
it is very much defined in in law

02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:04,319
and that was a very different frame for

02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:05,600
when i came to canada and i first

02:25:04,319 --> 02:25:08,399
encountered

02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:08,840
the different contracts we have around

02:25:08,399 --> 02:25:12,240
work

02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:14,479
here and that's for any system

02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:15,439
like any system at the very beginning

02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:17,200
might seem

02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:18,720
very hard because you don't really know

02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:20,560
the rules of the system and you need to

02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:22,399
gather a lot of information

02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:24,240
so to help your team members work

02:25:22,399 --> 02:25:27,120
through that um

02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:28,800
just trying to figure out apps there

02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:30,160
that you're not noticing noticing

02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:31,600
anymore because you've been doing them

02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:33,359
for a while like you know how work

02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:34,240
contract works because you've been

02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:37,280
working

02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:38,000
you know how to get to uh you know a

02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:40,240
medical center

02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,439
and get help because you've done that

02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:43,680
but someone has knew

02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:45,439
doesn't necessarily know it and it's not

02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:47,200
the way you do it in your culture is not

02:25:45,439 --> 02:25:48,240
necessarily obvious so try to help them

02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:51,840
with that ladder

02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:54,960
to get started in that task um

02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:56,160
and then i know the social norms in

02:25:54,960 --> 02:25:57,680
canada

02:25:56,160 --> 02:26:00,720
and i also know the social norms in

02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:03,920
poland and the fact that i know them

02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:05,280
um is sometimes not helpful because they

02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:06,000
might be conflicting there are different

02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:07,280
ways of reacting

02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:09,040
to things in poland than there are in

02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:11,840
canada so

02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:13,120
as simple as how are you in canada we

02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:15,280
kind of expect

02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:16,560
an answer that's you know nondescript

02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:18,240
and it's kind of a greeting but in

02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:20,160
poland that implies you're actually

02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:20,560
curious how someone feels and you're in

02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:23,760
for an

02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:25,680
answer so remember that whenever

02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:27,200
you ask me a question like that like i

02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:30,640
might know the proper

02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:31,280
canadian form or american form but i'm

02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:32,560
also

02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:34,640
coming from a culture that has a

02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:35,600
different approach to it and sometimes

02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:37,600
i'll just

02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:39,280
mix them up or forget or one of them

02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:42,399
will take over and

02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:43,120
even if i logically know something i've

02:26:42,399 --> 02:26:44,960
lived

02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:46,880
way more through the polish experience

02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:50,720
of that and that's my instinct

02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:52,720
when reacting to things um so

02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:53,840
you know keeping in mind that if someone

02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:56,000
crosses the norm that

02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:57,200
hurts someone else that's the most

02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,640
important thing that's happening in the

02:26:57,200 --> 02:27:01,040
moment so try to

02:26:58,640 --> 02:27:01,760
you know not use that as an excuse for a

02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:04,080
behavior

02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:05,760
that's just unacceptable but if it

02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:08,319
hasn't crossed online

02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:09,040
um just try to be curious like what's

02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:11,359
happening there

02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:12,160
is a cultural difference is it a

02:27:11,359 --> 02:27:14,720
language

02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:15,200
issue do they intend to do something

02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:18,319
else

02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:20,240
do they blurt out something weird

02:27:18,319 --> 02:27:21,359
a lot of things can happen and sometimes

02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:24,000
it's just

02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:25,680
wiring in my brain works differently in

02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:27,040
a given day and i say something stupid

02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:29,359
and i'm like oh

02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:31,600
right that was not the canadian thing to

02:27:29,359 --> 02:27:33,359
say and then i tell everyone on my team

02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:35,120
i'm having a polish day i'm sorry i

02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:35,920
can't think in canadian today and it's

02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:39,040
fine

02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:41,840
those days happen um so what are some

02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:44,560
other things you can try and do

02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:45,840
i think the first thing is to find a

02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:49,040
curiosity lens

02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:51,680
so try to find an experience that's

02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:53,600
similar to what your team members are

02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:55,600
going through

02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:57,200
like moving cities changing schools

02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:59,680
switching jobs

02:27:57,200 --> 02:28:00,800
and just remember how you felt in that

02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:03,760
situation

02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:04,240
and use it as a way to to understand

02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:07,520
their

02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:09,760
experience by at the same time not

02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:12,479
belittling it and saying oh you know i

02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:14,640
know how that works i moved schools or

02:28:12,479 --> 02:28:16,640
that's not what we're looking for here

02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:18,160
just just try to use it as a starting

02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:19,600
point for a conversation and say oh i

02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:21,439
don't actually understand like i had a

02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,240
similar experience but i think yours is

02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:23,600
different

02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:25,359
but if we find some ways they are

02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:26,800
similar going to help me

02:28:25,359 --> 02:28:29,600
empathize more and understand what

02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:32,800
you're going through secondly

02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:35,840
take a holistic view um i know

02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:37,280
you want to help your teammates um just

02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:39,359
remember that they are

02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:41,040
balancing and everyone is balancing

02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:42,800
learning and safety

02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:44,240
yes they want to learn and they want to

02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:46,479
degrade in this new culture

02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:48,080
and support the team but there's only so

02:28:46,479 --> 02:28:50,240
much learning they can take at the same

02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:54,000
time and if you

02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:56,000
if you make this balance um unstable

02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,520
it can just have a negative impact on

02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:59,439
their life so

02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:01,120
remember they're probably also facing

02:28:59,439 --> 02:29:02,640
other things outside of work or maybe at

02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:04,240
work with other teammates

02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:06,399
and there's only so much they can take

02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:08,960
so try to to make this relationship

02:29:06,399 --> 02:29:10,399
work long term and work through small

02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:12,560
changes rather than

02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:14,479
piling everything up because then this

02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:17,439
balance just topples over and it makes

02:29:14,479 --> 02:29:17,439
it way more stressful

02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:20,960
try to spark genuine curiosity so i

02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:23,200
don't mean like

02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:25,200
go to your teammates have a list of

02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:26,720
questions and ask them like oh i want to

02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:27,840
learn this and this and that thing about

02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:29,840
your country

02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:32,160
um because while you might be genuinely

02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:33,040
curious that might not come off as such

02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:34,800
to them

02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:36,399
try to find the moments in which they

02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:37,359
are opening up their culture and their

02:29:36,399 --> 02:29:39,200
ideas to you

02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:41,439
like they're cooking something and you

02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:43,920
you're learning a new dish from them or

02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:45,439
you know they're celebrating holiday or

02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:46,960
they used an emoji and you don't

02:29:45,439 --> 02:29:49,439
understand what they meant try to

02:29:46,960 --> 02:29:50,000
pick those moments and understand what

02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:51,280
it was about

02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,439
because sometimes it's not about the

02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:55,040
culture at all like i don't only

02:29:53,439 --> 02:29:57,200
cook polish food i cook a lot of

02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:58,560
different food so it's not necessarily

02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:59,600
about being being polished or baking

02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:02,399
immigrant

02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:03,760
um so try to just get curious and ask

02:30:02,399 --> 02:30:04,560
them questions and understand where

02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:07,120
they're coming from

02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:08,880
and what they're up to and again build

02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:12,080
that over time don't

02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:13,200
don't pile it up because um that might

02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:16,800
make for a very uncomfortable

02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:16,800
conversation for everyone involved

02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:21,359
um know yourself

02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:22,720
in the situation know what you are

02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:25,920
comfortable with

02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:27,040
and which hard topics you're ready to

02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:28,800
talk about

02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:30,720
um there are topics that come up on my

02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:31,120
team that not everyone wants to chat

02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:33,520
about

02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:34,160
that i usually ask when i was when i

02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:35,840
needed

02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:37,200
someone to help me with figuring out

02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:39,439
medical help

02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:40,960
um i asked if there's anyone who wants

02:30:39,439 --> 02:30:42,399
to do that and is comfortable with doing

02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:43,840
that because that's a topic not everyone

02:30:42,399 --> 02:30:45,920
wants to talk about

02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:48,000
um so try to figure out what you're

02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:49,520
comfortable with and communicate that

02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:51,359
and also if you change your mind that's

02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:52,880
also fine just communicate that you

02:30:51,359 --> 02:30:55,760
changed your mind

02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:56,880
um and remember about the context you

02:30:55,760 --> 02:31:00,080
have this conversation

02:30:56,880 --> 02:31:02,560
in so

02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:04,240
if it's a hard topic for you it might be

02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:06,479
for your teammates as well so maybe a

02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:08,560
better way of talking about it is on a

02:31:06,479 --> 02:31:09,520
video call rather than a group chat with

02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:10,960
everyone there

02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:13,359
and also remember that something might

02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:14,640
be hard for you in the other culture

02:31:13,359 --> 02:31:16,240
might be very easy it's like

02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:18,479
it's very easy for me to talk about

02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:20,160
money which is not necessarily a polish

02:31:18,479 --> 02:31:22,160
thing it's more of a me thing

02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:24,000
um and i find it very hard sometimes to

02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:26,319
remember that maybe that's not a topic

02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:28,800
everyone wants to talk about

02:31:26,319 --> 02:31:30,479
um you also need to be ready to make

02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:32,720
mistakes

02:31:30,479 --> 02:31:34,479
and i would say the mistakes you might

02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:35,200
be making in this relationship are the

02:31:34,479 --> 02:31:37,280
reverse of

02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:39,680
of the mistakes i was talking about when

02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:42,160
speaking about an immigrant experience

02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:43,760
so um you're always going to have some

02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:44,560
prejudice and sometimes you're going to

02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:46,319
act on it

02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:48,319
and that's fine like you're going to

02:31:46,319 --> 02:31:51,520
make those mistakes you can't

02:31:48,319 --> 02:31:53,359
escape them but try to recognize

02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:55,200
when that happens when you're

02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:56,240
generalizing like you're saying all

02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,920
polish people

02:31:56,240 --> 02:32:00,080
do this thing because this one polish

02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:02,479
person i know that's the thing

02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:03,760
are you assuming oh this person knew

02:32:02,479 --> 02:32:04,640
what they were doing and it did it on

02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:06,160
purpose

02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:07,600
when they actually just did something

02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:08,800
because they didn't understand what the

02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:10,160
custom is

02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:12,080
and they were lost and they were trying

02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:16,080
to figure out the situation

02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:18,240
or when they don't understand you and

02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:19,120
don't do something when you thought they

02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:20,640
would do it

02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:22,319
not because they didn't mean to

02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:24,240
understand you didn't want to help you

02:32:22,319 --> 02:32:26,960
because they just misunderstood what you

02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:29,760
meant maybe you were very vague maybe

02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:30,560
you said something as a question and you

02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:32,880
actually

02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:34,479
meant it as something they need to do

02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:36,479
which happens to me a lot

02:32:34,479 --> 02:32:37,600
um sometimes i need to ask is that a

02:32:36,479 --> 02:32:39,520
suggestion

02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:41,920
or do you actually want me to do that

02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:43,359
because if it's not

02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:45,120
something i have to do i might do

02:32:43,359 --> 02:32:46,240
something else because i make decisions

02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:49,280
on how i work

02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:50,479
um so try to be clear um and just stop

02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:53,760
yourself

02:32:50,479 --> 02:32:54,240
before reacting and try to find a lens

02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:56,479
through it

02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:57,359
makes sense that they had the right

02:32:56,479 --> 02:32:59,280
intentions

02:32:57,359 --> 02:33:02,399
and then there was some sort of

02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:05,520
misalignment in communication

02:33:02,399 --> 02:33:06,720
and lastly learn from other sources and

02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:08,560
other stories

02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:10,319
as i said at the beginning of this talk

02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:12,080
i am

02:33:10,319 --> 02:33:13,760
a very specific person with a very

02:33:12,080 --> 02:33:16,880
specific experience

02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:18,080
and this talk might not click for you

02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:19,920
and there might be something else that

02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:22,399
clicks for you like work in your

02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:23,920
communication skills in general because

02:33:22,399 --> 02:33:25,840
communicating with any team member is

02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:28,319
about your communication skills

02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:30,160
listening to other immigrants looking at

02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:30,720
data talking to experts there's so many

02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:33,840
ways

02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:34,880
that you can engage with this topic um

02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:36,960
so

02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:38,560
try to engage in different ways if the

02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:39,359
stock worked for you or it didn't work

02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:42,080
for you

02:33:39,359 --> 02:33:43,920
just try to figure out better ways you

02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:46,840
can get informed and keep yourself

02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:48,080
informed and just remember to spark

02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:50,720
curiosity

02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:52,080
um whatever you're doing to to make it

02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:55,439
better

02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:58,319
um and i think

02:33:55,439 --> 02:33:59,520
by now you see that this talk was more

02:33:58,319 --> 02:34:02,319
about

02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:03,520
supporting your team members any team

02:34:02,319 --> 02:34:05,840
members

02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:06,560
um new team members team members you

02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:08,399
maybe

02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:10,880
didn't have the best relationship with

02:34:08,399 --> 02:34:13,359
someone that you had a conflict with

02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:15,200
just anyone on your team and the

02:34:13,359 --> 02:34:17,840
immigration lens here is just

02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:19,439
one of many lenses that can happen in

02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:23,040
the work context

02:34:19,439 --> 02:34:25,200
and it's not word necessarily worse or

02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:27,920
better or special is just different

02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:28,240
so giving you some context of that i

02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:31,200
think

02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:34,319
was helpful but also remember that any

02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:37,359
of the strategies in any of those ideas

02:34:34,319 --> 02:34:39,040
work just well for your team for

02:34:37,359 --> 02:34:40,080
communicating and supporting your team

02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:43,200
members

02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:44,240
um so for me the best thing that helped

02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:46,479
me

02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:48,560
was just learning about communication

02:34:46,479 --> 02:34:50,720
skills and learning about

02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:53,439
supporting other people regardless of

02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:55,040
the context in which i was doing that

02:34:53,439 --> 02:34:57,040
so you don't only have to use those

02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:58,240
strategies to support your immigrant

02:34:57,040 --> 02:35:01,120
team members

02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:01,920
or understand them just support your

02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:04,479
team members

02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:06,720
with a lot of curiosity and being there

02:35:04,479 --> 02:35:13,840
for them

02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:13,840
thank you

02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:17,840
all right thank you alicia for that um

02:35:16,479 --> 02:35:20,479
that was a great talk

02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:22,319
and um i really liked a lot of these

02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:23,120
points and interesting i think even some

02:35:22,319 --> 02:35:25,200
of them can still

02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:26,800
apply to new jobs and communities as

02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:27,600
other things they can have a lot of

02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:29,439
their

02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:31,359
own cultures when you move into them as

02:35:29,439 --> 02:35:33,600
well and you may not know them but

02:35:31,359 --> 02:35:34,640
um i definitely love the specific call

02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:37,200
out to

02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:39,280
immigrants in them uh eliza are you

02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:42,479
there and are you unmuted

02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:45,920
i think i need to ask you to unmute

02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:47,680
hi here we go hello um

02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:50,160
i was kind of curious what do you think

02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:51,920
might be the one single most

02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:53,520
uh or the single best thing that a

02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:54,080
teammate could do to support an

02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:56,560
immigrant

02:35:54,080 --> 02:35:56,560
teammate

02:35:57,200 --> 02:36:04,560
hmm one single thing okay um

02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:08,000
i think the best thing um

02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:11,760
that they can do is just step back

02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:15,760
sometimes and give the space

02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:16,960
because oftentimes i would start talking

02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:19,359
about something

02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:21,280
and i process it in a different way or i

02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:23,680
speak about it in a different way

02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:25,200
and people people would get impatient

02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:27,040
and try to help me

02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:28,640
by interrupting me and and going a

02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:30,240
different direction

02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:32,000
um and i think the best thing they could

02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:33,840
do in that moment is step back away for

02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:36,479
me to call them

02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:37,680
and say hey like now i'm ready for you

02:36:36,479 --> 02:36:40,720
to help me

02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:42,560
um instead of them assuming i need

02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:43,760
help because they might just not know

02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:46,880
what i need

02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:48,640
so there is a lot and wanting to support

02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:50,160
your team members but just

02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:51,680
remembering that you need to understand

02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:54,720
them first before you help them

02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:57,840
i think that's the biggest thing

02:36:54,720 --> 02:37:00,319
yeah that makes a lot of sense um and

02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:01,840
how did you personally decide

02:37:00,319 --> 02:37:03,920
what kind of the polish cultures you

02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:04,800
wanted to keep versus what you wanted to

02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:07,920
adapt

02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:10,800
to like the canadian cultures um

02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:12,000
i think i'm often making those decisions

02:37:10,800 --> 02:37:13,600
as i go

02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,280
because there are certain things that a

02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:17,520
few years back i would

02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:18,880
never change and i would say this is the

02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:21,359
core of being polish

02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:22,479
and if you are telling me to change that

02:37:21,359 --> 02:37:25,600
that is just

02:37:22,479 --> 02:37:26,960
rude right this is my culture um one of

02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:30,080
the examples was

02:37:26,960 --> 02:37:32,479
pronouns in english polish does not have

02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:33,359
a non-gender specific pronoun the

02:37:32,479 --> 02:37:35,600
language does not

02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:37,200
support that and for a long time i would

02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:38,399
say you know it's very hard for me to do

02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:40,960
that in english

02:37:38,399 --> 02:37:41,520
because my native language does not have

02:37:40,960 --> 02:37:43,600
it

02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:45,439
and no matter how hard i try my brain

02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:47,840
just thinks in gender binary

02:37:45,439 --> 02:37:48,800
and over time by having more and more

02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:50,720
friends who did that

02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:52,640
and my understanding how to use it and

02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:55,359
by just getting support

02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:56,640
in in building that new language i was

02:37:55,359 --> 02:37:58,720
able to start using the

02:37:56,640 --> 02:38:00,560
they then pronouns or you know any

02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:03,840
pronouns that someone has

02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:06,880
um and that was a decision i made

02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:09,600
based on immersing myself in the culture

02:38:06,880 --> 02:38:11,359
and going through that hard time of of

02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:11,920
just changing how my brain thinks about

02:38:11,359 --> 02:38:14,560
english

02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:16,399
and things in english so a lot of those

02:38:14,560 --> 02:38:18,080
decisions i make based on

02:38:16,399 --> 02:38:19,920
you know how much happiness is going to

02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:22,000
bring me and people around me

02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:24,160
um is it going to bring me closer to

02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:26,240
people that i want to be close with

02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:27,920
um and not necessarily is it going to

02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:28,640
make my life easier because some of

02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:31,680
those things

02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:34,240
are surprisingly hard but mostly like

02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:34,720
can i get the support system to get

02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:36,479
there

02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:38,399
and do i have a safe space to make

02:38:36,479 --> 02:38:41,280
mistakes around it

02:38:38,399 --> 02:38:42,000
and i don't by now i don't really think

02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:44,720
there is anything

02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,680
i would say i'm forever going to do it

02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:47,600
the canadian way

02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:49,120
i'm forever going to do the polish way i

02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:50,960
think they're just going to keep

02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:53,200
changing

02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:54,000
yeah that makes sense um someone had

02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:56,080
mentioned

02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:58,240
uh in the artifacts live channel that

02:38:56,080 --> 02:39:00,640
they sometimes worry about feeling

02:38:58,240 --> 02:39:02,240
some people might see them as a threat

02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:05,280
to local jobs a threat

02:39:02,240 --> 02:39:07,359
um did you face any of this when you

02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:10,479
went over to canada and do you have any

02:39:07,359 --> 02:39:13,200
any suggestions for those that might

02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:13,840
um yeah i have heard go back to your

02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:16,479
country

02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:18,399
a few times um i would say more so in

02:39:16,479 --> 02:39:20,960
the uk than in canada

02:39:18,399 --> 02:39:23,200
um just because of the cultural

02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:25,040
difference to my country like in canada

02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:28,880
it's not as pronounced

02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:30,479
um i usually just if i'm in the space

02:39:28,880 --> 02:39:31,760
for a conversation with that person if

02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:33,439
they're not aggressive because they're

02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:34,479
digressive i'm just walking right like

02:39:33,439 --> 02:39:36,319
there is no point

02:39:34,479 --> 02:39:38,160
in talking to an aggressive person but

02:39:36,319 --> 02:39:42,160
if it was a co-worker

02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:45,439
or you know someone who is

02:39:42,160 --> 02:39:48,479
feels comfortable speaking their mind um

02:39:45,439 --> 02:39:50,720
i would start being curious like why

02:39:48,479 --> 02:39:52,800
why do you think that like why do you

02:39:50,720 --> 02:39:54,960
think i should go back to my country

02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:56,800
why do you think i'm a threat to the job

02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:58,640
market here like if my employer could

02:39:56,800 --> 02:40:00,080
find someone who's not an immigrant

02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:02,000
i'm pretty sure they'll hire a

02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:03,760
non-immigrant it's way easier to hire

02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,960
canadians than it is to hire polish

02:40:03,760 --> 02:40:06,800
people in canada

02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:08,399
why would i go through the trouble of

02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:10,080
getting me a job

02:40:08,399 --> 02:40:11,439
and pay me the same because i'm not

02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:13,279
being paid less because i'm an

02:40:11,439 --> 02:40:14,960
immigrant if they could just hire a

02:40:13,279 --> 02:40:16,080
canadian person and never worry about

02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:17,920
the cultural differences

02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:19,279
and any integration it's just like what

02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:21,040
makes you think

02:40:19,279 --> 02:40:22,720
i am doing this i'm taking away

02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:24,800
someone's job and

02:40:22,720 --> 02:40:26,720
i think that's a question of like can

02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:28,319
you engage in with this person or not do

02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:30,960
you feel safe to engage with them is

02:40:28,319 --> 02:40:33,680
this situation not threatening to you

02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:34,880
um and do you want to do that right

02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:36,319
because sometimes it's just best to

02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:37,200
ignore them because if you engage with

02:40:36,319 --> 02:40:39,600
them they

02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:41,600
they go off um into more and more

02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:43,359
intense ideas so

02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:44,720
i would make it more of a judgment call

02:40:43,359 --> 02:40:46,720
but if you care about

02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:48,479
a relationship with this person or maybe

02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:50,240
people who have a relationship with this

02:40:48,479 --> 02:40:53,439
person

02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:55,200
try understanding what they are thinking

02:40:53,439 --> 02:40:59,520
about there

02:40:55,200 --> 02:41:00,960
yeah how somebody had said

02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:02,720
they were wondering how they could stand

02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:04,160
up for their coworkers when their bosses

02:41:02,720 --> 02:41:05,680
aren't treating them very well because

02:41:04,160 --> 02:41:07,120
their english isn't very good

02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:09,120
so is there anything that a co-worker

02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:10,399
could do or is there anything a

02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:14,000
co-worker did for you

02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:14,000
that was really helpful in some way

02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:19,439
i remember one situation it was

02:41:17,359 --> 02:41:21,200
less about my english but it was about

02:41:19,439 --> 02:41:22,319
someone else's english i was working in

02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:25,120
the uk

02:41:22,319 --> 02:41:25,920
and someone had a very thick irish

02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:28,640
accent

02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:30,080
and at that point my english was pretty

02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:32,479
new and i couldn't understand

02:41:30,080 --> 02:41:33,200
them at all they would speak to me and i

02:41:32,479 --> 02:41:34,720
would try

02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:36,880
and i just couldn't understand them it

02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:38,560
was so hard and

02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:40,080
i talked to one of my co-workers and i

02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:41,840
said i'm sorry i'm supposed to work with

02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:43,760
this person on the project but i just

02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:45,279
cannot understand them for the life of

02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:48,399
me i'm trying

02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:49,279
and i'm just i'm not getting there so

02:41:48,399 --> 02:41:52,560
two things they did

02:41:49,279 --> 02:41:53,920
is um they found a different reason for

02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:55,040
me to not be on a project with that

02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:56,960
person because that would make it

02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:59,439
impossible for us to work

02:41:56,960 --> 02:42:00,720
and then they actually sat down with me

02:41:59,439 --> 02:42:02,800
and started helping me

02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:04,319
understand irish accents we would watch

02:42:02,800 --> 02:42:05,600
videos and they would tell me what the

02:42:04,319 --> 02:42:07,200
videos were about and

02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:08,640
we were talking slowly but surely i

02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:09,439
build up this understanding of the

02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:12,000
accent

02:42:09,439 --> 02:42:12,640
so that was something i experienced and

02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,399
then

02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:15,840
supporting my team members here in

02:42:14,399 --> 02:42:18,240
canada

02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:19,120
i've never experienced that in canada

02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:22,080
but i've

02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:23,520
i've seen other team members maybe not

02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:25,520
knowing what they're supposed to do when

02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:27,040
someone's english is not up to par in

02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:29,200
their opinion

02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:30,800
and i was just very firm i said you do

02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:32,880
not correct someone

02:42:30,800 --> 02:42:34,800
if it does not change the meaning you do

02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:37,439
not correct documentation

02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:38,240
internal documentation because somebody

02:42:37,439 --> 02:42:41,200
you know

02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:43,439
forgot a v or an a because prs that are

02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:45,120
there just to correct someone's english

02:42:43,439 --> 02:42:46,800
uh when they're a software engineer are

02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:49,040
not great because

02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:50,560
you're focusing on something else than

02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:51,600
the job is about right like you don't

02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:53,840
want to spend the time

02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:55,279
correcting their english if it does not

02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:57,920
at the end of the day matter

02:42:55,279 --> 02:42:58,560
you're not there to do that and if they

02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:00,240
ask you

02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:02,080
to help them with their english only

02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:03,920
then you can do it but

02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:05,600
they have been hired for this job

02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:07,840
they're able to communicate

02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:09,760
they're able to do their job unless it's

02:43:07,840 --> 02:43:12,080
interfering with what they're doing

02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:13,279
you do not get to correct them and even

02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:15,120
if you do

02:43:13,279 --> 02:43:17,040
i mean treat it as correcting anything

02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:19,040
else just remember

02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:20,399
language skills are as skill as anything

02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:22,160
else right so

02:43:20,399 --> 02:43:25,279
they can grow and improve them and

02:43:22,160 --> 02:43:25,279
everyone makes mistakes

02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:34,080
i made it myself yeah definitely um

02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:34,960
and i think we're about out of time for

02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:37,279
a q a

02:43:34,960 --> 02:43:38,640
i saw a couple more questions pop up at

02:43:37,279 --> 02:43:41,120
the last moment but

02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:43,279
um you can definitely keep asking those

02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:45,840
in our artifacts live channel
