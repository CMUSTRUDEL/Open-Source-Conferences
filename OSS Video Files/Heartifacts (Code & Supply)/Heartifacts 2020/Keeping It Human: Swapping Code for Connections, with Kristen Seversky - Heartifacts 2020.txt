Keeping It Human: Swapping Code for Connections is a talk about the pivot from a decade of software development to a product role through the use of Design Thinking and an affinity for people.

Too often we see the negative impact of the "move fast; break things" model in tech and how disconnected we, as developers, can often find ourselves from the human experience. In my talk, I'll highlight my nontraditional shift out of code and how I became passionate about business and people problems (internally and externally!) with the help of my cross-cutting skills.

My goal for this talk to is to offer a new path for folks in tech and be the living example of how you can apply your skills in ways that might not seem viable in the traditional, linear tracks. Let's shake things up and connect the missing dots!

um some of us have remote jobs anyway

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,200
but 2020 has brought a lot of people

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,480
uh to being remote now so when we don't

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
see ourselves

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,240
every day or see our co-workers every

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
day um it makes a lot harder for

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,280
us to see all of our co-workers as

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,800
people and

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,119
same thing for kind of our software's

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,560
users and dr simmons mentioned in her

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,000
talk that

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,680
some things like that when we're burnt

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,279
out it's hard for us to see some other

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,880
people's humanity which i think is a

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,560
good lead-in for our next talk from

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,039
kristen siverski

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,040
kristin's a product owning code writing

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,800
design thinking people person

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,239
that wants to make tech more meaningful

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,399
and ethical in our world

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,239
her easily excited high energy and

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,920
deeply curious personality

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,600
tosses her in a lot of directions and

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
she enjoys the idea bringing more of

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,320
ourselves

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,600
to our work when she's not at a computer

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,039
which is rarely the case

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
you can find her running around with her

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,480
dog draining her energy in some gamer

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,199
sport or continuing her stream of

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,039
consciousness

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,640
on twitter kristen's talk's called

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,440
keeping it human swapping code for

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
connections

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,559
and take it away kristin awesome thank

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,920
you i'm gonna hit the share now

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,960
hopefully that get the right screen too

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,520
and all right so hopefully you can see

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,600
my

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
intro screen keeping it human stopping

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,640
code for connections

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,479
good to go uh i do want to warn that

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,080
this discussion trying to put this at a

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,200
half hour session was

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,240
difficult so i'm uh i did try to do my

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,640
best to capture

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,360
not only my own story so you can see

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,880
from my

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,479
own example as a person that went

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,759
through this what i

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,159
what you could expect from trying to

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,560
shift uh in your career but also

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,320
why i wanted to shift in my career in my

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,320
ever pursuit of

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,920
keeping it human and bringing the most

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,360
of myself to my roles

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,960
what that can mean in our current

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,079
industry so uh

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,240
to help set some uh expectations i did

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,360
give a bit of an outline so what are you

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,360
about to hear

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,720
you can expect to hear this talk uh a

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,600
lot about career shifts

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,479
as well as my own story as an example so

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,640
i i didn't go

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,479
like off the wall here with a billion

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,840
role changes but i did do

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,520
some that caught a lot of people off

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,560
guard and i think that's the that's the

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,160
reason why

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,759
when i bring this stuff up uh in other

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,440
circles people are like oh i'm on the

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,879
fence of this kind of change

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,040
what can i expect and i get like

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,640
messaging on the side of hey

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,239
what what else did you go through or

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,520
what can i do with this so

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,599
once i started to see more of that i was

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
like well here i will put on a platform

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,400
we can talk

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120
about it uh and maybe this will scratch

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,879
some more

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,319
brains into thinking about exploring

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,360
their own role changes

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,879
and what that can mean for yourself um

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,800
so the third bullet there is navigating

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,040
status quo and the realities of our

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,080
current you know our society our

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,319
industry

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,560
uh because you'll see in pretty critical

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,800
times of my past where i've had the beef

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
i was faced with a make or break

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,440
decision like okay you did all this

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,200
stuff you did the work now

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,440
pick what you're gonna do and stick with

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,440
it so i want to talk a little bit

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,000
about that and how that impacts us and

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,440
that ability to be flexible in roles

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,280
and ultimately i want this to start a

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,959
conversation uh

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,959
as my intro states and as you'll see in

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,239
this in these slides i'm very

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,040
extroverted i like connecting with

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,120
people

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,159
and if it means talking about things as

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,080
an example

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,519
that would make me very happy so you

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,560
know find me on twitter and find me in

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,159
the

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
slack we can talk about this as much as

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,480
we want what this will not be

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,760
is a tip about each individual role i

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,040
had i don't want to make this like a

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,640
deep dive of like here's how to be a

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,680
software dev here's how to be in design

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,560
thinking like those are

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
you're not going to get that in this

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,840
talk you're also not going to get a

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,519
truly deep dive in my experience

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,920
nor is this a talk about where i've

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,239
worked because it's more about the shift

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,799
and

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,920
the reality around that than where i

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,840
worked or what

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
and i also tried very hard to avoid long

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
wind and tangents i

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,319
you'll see a couple times in the slides

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,080
where i'm i'm going to block myself from

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,360
going off on deep end

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,519
uh but i put parentheses disclaimer so

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,560
that's the agenda uh we're gonna quickly

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,080
go through my background just me

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,640
personally see me as a little one

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,239
um picking a path that impact of having

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,760
to pick and choose like okay what do you

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,239
do with your life and your career

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,599
uh how i chose dev a big shift that

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,560
happened later and then how i got the

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,319
product life

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,400
the core of this talk that i want is to

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,840
focus on the faq section i know we have

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
breakouts later but

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
i've since in this whole journey

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,080
surfaced a lot of questions i get over

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,400
the years that maybe i can just offer to

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,919
you instead of you having to ask me

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,759
because i think that's usually what

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,519
people come talk to me about anyways

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,680
and then i'll just wrap up with a quick

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,520
summary so let's get rolling

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,720
okay so who the heck am i a quick

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,160
background

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,160
i'm telling you this because i think

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,560
it's important to know my personality

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
type

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,919
how someone like me navigates in the

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,800
industry and

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,120
how i choose roles and to see that a lot

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,880
of stuff people is very deeply ingrained

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
so this is a snapshot of when i was

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,360
seven and a half this was an easter

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,360
morning

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,800
uh i just i'm running around my brothers

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,400
i four older brothers they're running

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
around behind me looking for eggs but

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,240
i'm on the ground and completely

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,840
pumped why because i got this little

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,120
slip of paper in one of my eggs

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
you can't read it i was going to show

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
you the video i had this on video but it

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,120
wouldn't have translated

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
but on that piece of paper it says 15

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,160
minutes

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
on aol and i kid you not at seven and a

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
half i just wanted nothing more

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,240
was to like be near the internet be buy

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,440
computers near devices so this is a

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
deeply ingrained

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,800
fascination that i've had since i was

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,680
young that

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,600
was at least my kind of beacon of i

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,360
think i want careers or

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,199
opportunities in this space or whatever

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,560
lets me stay close to this

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,880
and i'm grateful i had this because uh

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,720
i i also tripped upon a really nice math

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,160
teacher people thank your teachers they

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
help you more than you know

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,240
that guided me towards programming

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,680
because she saw she's like okay you like

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
a lot of people you like connecting with

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,400
people you like computers and you like

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,479
math

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,479
i will avoid a whole tangent about math

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,039
being related to good development by the

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,360
way

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,639
see tangent's not going to do it but i

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
happen to like math because of the

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,280
puzzles

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,800
and so she guided me towards a

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,560
programming class

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
and to me i was like all right well i'll

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,199
go try this out i really like being near

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,319
these devices

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,440
and people i'll tell you this right here

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,120
was a game changer i took the sole

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,319
programming class in high school i was

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,880
about 14 or 15

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,840
when i played with visual basic and it

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,840
was probably

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,000
it was like the first time where i saw

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,000
all my interests coming together into

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,240
one spot because i could make

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
these dialog boxes and screens and i can

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,759
add colors

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,800
and i could then program it to do what i

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,319
want with the patterns and the syntax so

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
and just ultimately i'm thinking of like

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,400
how can i make things that help people

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,240
and put it online and all these other

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,720
dreams that came to life in front of me

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,759
through programming so that is what led

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080
me towards

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,280
uh this whole like okay i guess i want

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,639
to do programming

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,639
um and i'm glad i had this because

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,880
here's the next thing that we did

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,319
society slams this at you when you're a

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,520
teenager and says okay

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,800
kid what do you want to do with your

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,080
life and uh as someone who's

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
like that's that's almost like putting

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,120
the cage around me like okay well pick

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,800
one thing hope you don't screw it up

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,400
because you got to get this right

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,080
and it's really hard to change like all

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,039
these things permeated my mind as a

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,280
teenager

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,400
and i tried really hard to guide myself

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,479
towards something

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,440
but once again that same math teacher

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,000
and man she

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,840
she's helped me in my my life but she

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,759
came up to me and was like hey so i know

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,520
you're trying to decide on colleges

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,800
uh have you thought about this one over

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,400
here over that because i

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,680
really thought i could only just do like

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
i t i thought it was going to be like a

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
vanilla course

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,280
or sorry degree and that that was just

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,919
my life now i'll be an i.t

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,360
but fortunately she let me know about

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,560
rochester institute of technology which

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,319
is out here in rochester

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,759
where i live now and i ended up coming

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,360
here for college

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,360
and found a degree that had a bit of

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,560
everything in it and so once again you

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
can see in my personality type i'm

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,560
trying to bring

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,560
more to a hard decision that usually

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,479
wants us to do like one

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,080
so i managed to wiggle through that went

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,599
to rit there's a proof

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,280
i didn't buy that image sorry great

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,319
images it's proof though i'm keeping the

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,120
watermark

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,800
and i got my two degrees uh and was like

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,879
yay i know what i'd like to do in life

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,120
but then boom again

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,240
what one career path do you want and

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,800
it's like ugh

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,199
okay once again i'm kind of stuck with

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,240
uh picking and choosing so

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,599
uh i ended up through my degree and

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,759
everything i had behind me i

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,599
went for software development right so

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,400
my first foray into

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,160
my career was in software development uh

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
and i'm not saying this negatively by

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,120
the way i

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,400
kept as i kept repeating this uh

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
presentation i was like is this coming

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,120
off like i

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,440
begrudgingly went into dev it's not the

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
case at all it was once again going back

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,120
into like

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,200
2010 figuring out what can i do to bring

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
the most of my humanity to a role

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,719
and at the time the option from me

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,880
seemed to be software development

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,039
and so that was my new home and i loved

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,959
it so this was me in 2013

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,240
at breaking development that was the

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,959
name of the conference at the time

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,399
which then changed to beyond the desktop

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,320
so this is nashville

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,320
everyone trustingly put down their

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,080
devices and let people take pictures

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,440
like remember when we used to detach

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
from our devices this is what you can

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
get

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,040
so this really embodied where i was in

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,000
my career at this point i really felt

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,920
at home like my homeostasis was here but

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,800
at the same time i was in my second

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,120
software

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,519
uh job at this point and in that job

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,640
i was able to bring a lot to the table

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,240
uh because it

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,839
i was a sole developer uh let me

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,040
rephrase that because i was a sole

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,720
developer at this second

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,080
job of my life i was able to bring a lot

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,360
of me to the table

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,959
because i had to solve problems for

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,880
a national company that had clients all

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,080
over the u.s but it was just me

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,839
i was just building databases and uis to

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
help connect and we were maintaining the

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,120
in-house server

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,880
and then at the end of the day i had to

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,440
be the support person for

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,800
everything i built as well which that

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,800
scratches a niche that i don't see as

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,279
much in different software places that's

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,320
that brought my keep it human to life in

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,519
my coding job

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,279
because i not only was having to do all

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
those other pieces but

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,560
to hear firsthand from the people

00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,920
themselves complaining about using your

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,320
code that you built

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,959
is an experience i think more of us

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,440
should have

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,279
and in that role that's when i realized

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,920
ooh i really need to stay close to end

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,240
users

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,519
and close to customers and people and

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,480
try to keep all of this

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,920
as human as possible because it's very

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,279
easy to splinter out and start getting

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,560
into your silos and then

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,720
next thing you know you're just building

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,000
and coding which happened a lot

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,760
there were a lot of times where i was

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,640
just like building something and you

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,200
know you lose

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,320
you lose concept at the end goal and you

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,040
just throw that code out you miss the

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,519
mark

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,720
so back to the point of like okay well i

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,000
need to do something else in my career

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
because that's what society tells you

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,560
it's like you have to move forward keep

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,959
moving forward so i was like okay i

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,680
guess i go for senior developer

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,240
and once again astrix around tangents

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,760
i'm

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,519
i can make a whole presentation on what

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
does senior mean what does that mean in

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,040
this

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,040
industry what are we saying to people

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,240
when we put senior on things i'll avoid

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,160
the tangent i just want to throw that

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,600
out there as a bone to pick

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,920
but either way i became a senior

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,200
developer but then something

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,000
happened that i did not plan a while

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,240
design thinking

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
training appeared so in my third role

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,839
when i was a senior software developer

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,160
my the company i worked for at the time

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,600
decided to bring on a design thinking

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,839
uh training and i lit up because

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,680
thinking about back to my college degree

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,360
and the fact that i found all these ways

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,000
to blend all of my interests yet i still

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,640
had to

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
pick certain facets at a time i was like

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
oh it felt like you're seeing your old

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,480
hat you're like

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,160
i could bring this old hat back and wear

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
it and it's okay like we

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,399
i didn't have to just leave that one

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,160
behind uh so this all it was a three-day

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,360
training i got very excited and for

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,839
those of you that don't

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,440
know what design thinking is uh this is

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,240
a still from the cooper

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
professional education video they have

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,440
uh

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,680
crash courses on vimeo i do have to put

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,440
a damper on real quick people

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,120
uh cooper had to shut their doors this

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,519
year because of kovid so

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,800
you know as i sit and give this talk i

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,399
know we're all here virtually and we're

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,480
doing this and it's possible

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
i do like to take a moment to really

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
highlight the fact that we're in the

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,120
middle of this

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,399
wild time weird time and even some of

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,079
the resources that you're seeing

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,320
might not be available for a long time

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,160
uh because of a pandemic so

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,360
that's a bummer but you know in

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,360
solidarity with

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,800
the what they trained me on and how they

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
impacted my career i was like well i'll

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
give them a still from what i learned

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,800
so this is a high-level view of this of

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,320
the design thinking process

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,839
it's essentially adding that research

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,240
friction up front

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,399
in the process so when you're going to

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,160
start working on solutions or

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,440
problems to solve you you want to focus

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
on understanding

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,839
the end users and the people involved so

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,399
it understands kind of loaded word right

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,560
but it's

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,160
empathizing getting into the shoes of

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,079
and looking at their environment

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,519
finding stories and then with those

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,800
stories and those details you can start

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,120
to envision this is where the sticky

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
note

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,399
stuff comes in you see people putting

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,680
sticky notes and everything

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,440
and then you get into prototyping so

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,760
like that's when you start to actually

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,040
get into code is that prototype phase to

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,079
just make high

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,440
level uh just tinker

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,440
a bit with the idea that you have and

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,959
you iterate because

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,560
i'm just speaking for myself but a lot

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,399
of my career and observing the world

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,399
around me through the past decade

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,639
it's a lot of like i have an idea code

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,160
it and it's like okay well

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,760
that's nice but you're missing a lot of

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,079
in-between pieces and are you sure

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,680
you know why you're coding this or who

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,800
you're coding it for and it's

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,560
all those big meaty purpose-driven

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,639
questions that just get bypassed for the

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,959
sake of move fast break things

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,000
uh so anyways having this design that

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,320
can come in was

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
a breath of fresh air for me it brought

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,720
me into this type of role and dynamic

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,079
where you can

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,480
work with people from across different

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,800
departments and actually

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,320
you know see how people think from a

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,680
vantage point of sales

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,279
versus engineering versus marketing and

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,800
even your ceo like we had our ceo

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,800
involved with these sessions

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,040
and it was just really fun to get

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,199
different ideas and hash this together

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,279
and i think it really brings forward a

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,199
north star for more people to align to

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,480
and work cohesively together keep and

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,800
human right

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,240
um so this was the big shift though not

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,160
to be a spoiler alert but

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,000
this was when i was like oh i really

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,839
like this um

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
how can i infuse this more in my

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,800
day-to-day how can i because i can't

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,480
just cut this off now you can't just

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,279
have this training and then cut this off

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,720
and go back to normal uh unfortunately

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,399
fortunate for me my company actually

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,959
opened up a full-time role for this

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,519
and i took it and let me tell you people

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,440
were deeply confused when i went from

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,800
all that time of building up my software

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,839
dev cred to

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,639
suddenly this stuff and i got a lot of

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,920
this

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,959
people are just like wait so you code

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,360
but you're doing

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,720
design thinking but you're not like the

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,560
cognitive dissonance when you make a

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,160
shift like this is strong

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,079
and people are gonna look and ask a lot

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,360
of questions and even worse they like to

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,839
think that they know that you're not

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
gonna

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,360
like it i got a lot of people that were

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,720
like oh you'll get bored you'll you'll

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
miss it you'll go back

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,959
and that's to be expected right like if

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,279
you know me and how much i enjoyed

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,360
my software side uh the development side

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,760
that's a fair assessment but

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
you know what i wanted to do to counter

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,120
all that is show people that i'm not

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,199
leaving anything behind i'm not just

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,360
dropping and running i'm bringing

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,120
my software development with me into a

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,800
new role to get to a different vantage

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,000
point together

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,480
and some of the highlights i don't have

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,480
to really amplify it too much it's just

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
here's what kind of happened i will

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,600
disclaim they don't own

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,199
these impacts like this wasn't just like

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,240
because of me it was because of design

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,199
thinking in this

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,959
uh opportunity i did get to see scrum

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,000
teams looking at who and why a little

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,680
more consistently

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,519
and not just jumping into the what and

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,560
how they're building things at the user

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,360
story level

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,399
so even just peppering in some of this

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,759
at the team level

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,480
is oops is a is an improvement from

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,839
the usual just build fast and product

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
owners and businesses

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,120
uh business folks around me were

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,959
recognizing different strategies

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,560
and instead of just jumping to oh that's

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,519
the hottest thing to build or that's the

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,759
most important

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,639
they were able to stop and just put that

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,800
friction up and

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,720
ask and go wait are we doing this is

00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,920
this is this really the most important

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,040
thing

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,480
who why and again just repeating that

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,000
kind of process same for sales and

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,560
marketing instead of

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,320
instead of waiting for a window to just

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,279
place a product in and just say yeah you

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
need this like

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,759
i could tell there was different

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,279
discussions that were listening for

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,480
opportunities to solve problems in

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,920
different ways

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,759
and that even actually led to a lot of

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,639
sales coming to our dev teams like hey i

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,399
had this call

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,399
and i was gonna give them this product

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,959
but then i thought what if we bring this

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,880
over here

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,880
with this feature and it started to help

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,040
build a backlog for future

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,959
implementations so it's not to make this

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,839
out like this is a magical thing but it

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,920
did impress me

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,680
at the time of how much a little nudge

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,519
in this direction makes a big difference

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,920
um so that was and plus i got to have a

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,759
lot of fun with it i got to switch over

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
to a new realm and give talks from

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,759
different angles instead of talking

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,560
about

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,240
you know my code editor or something

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,880
cheesy in the dev side like i was able

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
to

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,160
go over and talk about why should you

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,639
care about the human experience and i

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,360
think because of that shift it let me

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,079
bring an angle from my dev history on

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,920
top of this

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,519
very necessary you should care about the

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,480
human experience

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,199
and it was just a good time um all

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,360
around

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,199
unfortunately the company started taking

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,400
a different angle and so i was kind of

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,799
faced once again with

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,160
you have to make a choice on another

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,120
role you have to move on

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,600
where are you gonna go what are you

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,120
gonna do and i still again despite all

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,319
this history of trying to bring the most

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,319
of me into a role

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,720
i still was like oh no do i go back to

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,760
code do i stick to this design work what

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,720
do i do

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,080
and i ended up going with products so as

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,679
i got to know product more

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,039
and i assure you i can ask everyone in

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,480
this room what product means them you're

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,360
going to get a different answer

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
uh but and i can also attest that for

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,640
this reason

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
there's memes for days on products uh or

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,200
product people

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,480
and i can tell you i can identify with

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
each of these at a different day at any

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,960
given point

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,520
so yeah there's a lot to learn on the

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,760
product side uh but for me

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,039
i wanted to still have that role that

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,799
let me bring in that

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,720
quantitative quality of analysis that i

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,240
got from my design thinking but also be

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,360
close to the developers so i can

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,840
keep that kind of uh that code

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,640
dev day-to-day feeling as well and

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,440
product ownership

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,360
really gave me that opportunity so and

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,919
it's the best of all my worlds just to

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,120
kind of distill all that i'm still close

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,120
to code i have

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,120
multiple teams i work with that i get to

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,960
see day to day how they ram into things

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,480
i'm still among the developers i see how

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,280
they think and dig into code

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,240
or uh bugs and limitations i too i will

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,760
joke in meetings where i'm like i'm

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,480
putting on my dev hat just deal with me

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
but

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,559
if you go this path you're gonna run

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,880
into this issue with this service and so

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,559
i can still bring all that in plus i'm

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,320
also bringing in the fact that i didn't

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,600
i didn't think about making my actual

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,160
product level more

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,200
tool efficient so i've been i've

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,280
subsequently ended up

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,640
building things for the product level

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,799
that are solutions

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
and that's kind of been a fun element of

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,880
uh blending my

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,039
two roles together even more so and as

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,559
for the design thinking side of my past

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,720
i'm still interviewing end users that's

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,320
a big part of product ownership uh

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,600
and gathering those stories like i

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,200
literally like to go sit in our

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,559
different departments and just be like

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
what's your world like what do you do

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,120
what do you need to make sure that we're

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,080
i can be that bridge to our development

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,960
and making sure that we're building the

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,799
right things

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,160
uh same with identifying personas and

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,039
all that wonderful jazz of design

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,960
thinking

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,320
of making sure that you know who you're

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,840
you're building for

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,840
and finding that why so these are all

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,440
this is all hopefully reassuring to

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,799
folks that if you are on that precipice

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,760
of like i need to do something different

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,679
that you don't

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,120
leave this stuff behind that comes with

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,360
you

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,799
so i did want to leave at least you know

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,760
the 10 minutes for the frequently asked

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,640
questions section

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,080
so hopefully by me giving these to you

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,760
that will reduce the uh

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,400
questions you have later for me but

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,000
either way some main ones are

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,919
let's say i'm considering a switch how

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,760
might i decide it's a good idea

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,960
and this is deeply personal i i don't

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,880
feel comfortable saying

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,799
yes it's a great idea like across the

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,360
board it's to each their own

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,320
but i do have some ways that i know i

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,320
help myself

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,440
navigate whether this was the right idea

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,600
so asking yourself like

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,799
what the day-to-day change would be what

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,039
what kind of goals

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,880
are you looking for or what's making you

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,559
want to get out of the role you're in

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,000
really checking in with those motives to

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,919
see you know

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,520
is this is this being driven by

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,080
something different or am i just

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,200
bored am i you know i'm someone who gets

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,720
a little bit

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,159
uncomfortable when i'm too comfortable

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,520
so it's another thing where i'm like

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,520
okay i've been here long enough

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,880
this is time to do something different

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,360
so maybe that's something else that

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,120
might be

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,880
in the back as a motive that you don't

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,640
you're not really recognizing

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,400
and another one i think is important for

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
this question is

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,559
are you able to change your mind because

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,320
some people they want to try this out

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,679
and sometimes you might get into it and

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,280
you realize

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,720
and you might not be able to make any

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,880
adjustment from there

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,400
for instance if you're up and moving for

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,240
a new role like

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,679
i would weigh that that risk a little

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,840
bit because i had the luxury of being in

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,600
the same company they knew who i was

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,799
they knew what i was interested like

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,280
what my goals were so it wasn't like

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,520
this jarring shift within the company

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,559
so those are all little kind of warnings

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,039
that i would ask you

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,320
if you're on this path what's a

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,440
misconception about product that you had

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,760
as a developer

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,440
and how that changed so because of my

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,200
roles i didn't have a whole plethora

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,880
of product owners so i don't have like

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,880
this anecdotal evidence of

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,320
one assumption but i did really have

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,159
that kind of steve jobsy

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,080
approached product of like you got one

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,679
person who just has a vision that they

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,400
just want to see happen

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,799
and i thought it was very

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,679
individualistic so i was like oh well

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,840
maybe

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,039
you know each product owner really has

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,720
hard visions that they just

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,480
drive and now that i'm in the product

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,799
space quite different

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,240
i will i will note that it all depends

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,880
on the size your company too and your

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
structure

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,159
but i personally see myself as more of a

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,400
product coordinator

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,000
i look over a lot of our platform needs

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,600
and make sure that things are

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,880
you know just moving along and fluidly

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,440
staying aligned so that it's not just

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,200
this

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,480
ramming effect of different teams

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,799
clashing together

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,000
so um that one definitely i learned in

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,520
real time

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,080
very much a different thing than what i

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,400
expected question three what skills did

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,760
you pick up when you shifted a product

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,840
i really wish i could tell you that i

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,679
got better at writing short concise and

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,960
sweet emails i think that that's

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,400
something that really good product

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,080
people are good at or just people in

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,280
general that are especially remote now

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,880
if you can write a really good email

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,400
that gets the point across in a

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
couple minutes bravo uh but the biggest

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,480
one

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,240
and this is one that i don't know if i

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,440
would have gotten as a developer i think

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,080
about that often

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,760
not dying on every hill that is

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,919
definitely a lesson from

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,559
a product that i've been forced to face

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,080
because i feel like in my dev sphere of

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,240
influence i was able to see

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,600
whether it was a bug or a path i wanted

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,280
to take with the code

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,880
i had that control to just go do that

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,640
thing and you could just be like yeah

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
i'm gonna fix it i'm gonna fix that

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,600
bringing that attitude to products

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,480
especially in a big company like mine is

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,919
way

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,760
you have to watch it because then you

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,200
can start you know burning out and

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,679
wanting to take on everything

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,640
uh and so that was that was a big lesson

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,080
to watch for

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,919
between these roles um question four

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,880
is what do you and don't you miss about

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,840
your old roles okay so the big one is

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,480
we i miss putting on my headphones

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,159
finding

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,240
a really good playlist and just getting

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,440
lost in code that is something that you

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,400
cannot replicate

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,960
you can't i can't find a way to scratch

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,880
that itch

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,159
in different roles like that is one that

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
if you still have that in your goal

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,720
right now

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
cherish that one because that's uh

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,159
that's essentially what got me into

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,760
software and why i was interested in it

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,159
is because i found something where i can

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,080
get lost in and with all my interests

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,520
you know it was hard to cough that up

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,960
but at the same time

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,480
you i recognize that i don't want to do

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,760
that every day though it's not something

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,320
i need to do every day

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,760
it's why i'm like okay cool i know i can

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,600
go back to that i will always have code

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,880
in my back pocket if i want to

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
what else can i do to help wrangle

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,960
people and focus on the human element

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,720
and less of the code element

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,000
question five what advice would you give

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
yourself if you can go back

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,760
when you decide to change career paths

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,720
the biggest advice i can give is just

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,080
pace yourself

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,919
i think people think that these are

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,000
little modest jumps

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
from rolled roll it could even be within

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,600
your own company like just

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,679
pace yourself reset your expectations

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,720
give yourself room to absorb what's

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,360
going on

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,720
i um if you haven't gleaned yet i tend

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,760
to be a little more fast-paced and i get

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,039
really eager

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,039
to just take things on and run but

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,200
this role change was it took time not

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,679
only to set the expectations of everyone

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,720
else

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,919
but even just to get my own

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,679
understanding of what i was going

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,120
through on top of

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,960
the reality check of being in a new

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,600
company like all that stuff added up

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,279
together

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,960
and i wish i could just go back and say

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,799
you're doing okay you don't have to have

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,520
this mastered in two weeks like it's not

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,159
even

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,400
possibly realistic so uh just giving

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,039
your yourself space to

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
absorb those changes okay so i threw a

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,679
lot at you

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,679
i have it too long didn't read because i

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,000
know that was there's a lot here it's a

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,919
lot

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,520
it's easy for me to meander on this one

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,960
if anything stood out to you or you want

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
to get deeper into any of these topics

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,400
by all means come find me

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,919
but here's my too long didn't read it's

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,840
uh check the rules in your head

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,600
because i'm hoping the takeaway from

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
this talk is that you can see how often

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,559
in my

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,279
life i had to do this like i have to

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,279
pick one

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,799
i have to do this i have to do that now

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,120
i go to senior now i do

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,960
like there's a lot of robotic cues in my

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,080
world in my career that i

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,880
i kind of wish i could have checked them

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,799
more and and just tested them more

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,320
uh especially since you know thinking

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,919
back to the design thinking

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,840
that was completely off the map i didn't

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,880
plan that and that came in and it was

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,880
just an opportunity

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,159
to flex in a different way and take on a

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,320
role in a different way

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,440
so if you don't check those rules and

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,679
you don't expand

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,039
that you know that thinking in your mind

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,440
you might miss stuff like that and say

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,240
well that's nice but i'm a developer and

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,880
then you're

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,400
you're forever in that column when you

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,240
could totally be doing other things

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,919
altogether so double check that you're

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,640
giving yourself space to explore those

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,279
paths

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,080
and find out what better suits you spot

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,159
the lesson

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,200
this one this i see this kind of

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,640
snarkily because i feel like

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,480
with this whole pandemic right now we're

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,000
all in the middle of trying to figure

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,760
out what the lesson with all this is

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,919
like what can we take from this in this

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,440
time into the future that

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,440
isn't you know that is productive and

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,240
helpful uh but

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,760
pandemics aside if possible each role

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,720
can give you a bit of a lesson to take

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,559
forward because there's

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,080
there's not a single role that i've had

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,880
that i look back and think that was a

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,720
waste of time

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,000
right like that's i want to reduce that

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,600
mindset that you

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,440
drop these things and that nothing's

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,279
relevant even between industries even if

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,279
you switch industry i guarantee you

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,960
you're gonna bring something from that

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,039
last one over to the new one

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,799
that will help you in some way it and

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,720
that's back to if you spot that lesson

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,240
and carry it

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,919
uh just for example though i did want to

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,320
add example like the not dying on every

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,679
hill

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,840
that was my lesson right that was my

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,679
most recent product last night as a

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,120
concrete example of

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,960
i would probably keep running into that

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,679
problem if i didn't just go oh this is

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,039
my thing

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,520
i have to grow through this this is my

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,600
thing so it helps you to

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,360
uh unstick yourself as well so hopefully

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,919
that is a way to

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,640
spin a potentially not so fun experience

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,960
into something positive for yourself

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,640
nothing is forever uh if anything i

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,200
think this past year has shown us a lot

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,760
that

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,520
what we thought is the normal forever is

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,159
apparently not nuts

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,440
and i'm personally kind of uh the

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,640
personality type that if the table's

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,120
flipped i'm like what else can we throw

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,760
in the air

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,640
so nothing's forever lots of things are

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,799
changing all the time

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,080
especially in our industry especially in

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,799
the world around us

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,240
uh try not to lock yourself in uh i get

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,480
that it's helpful

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,399
for pushing yourself along and trying to

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,039
stay focused in an industry that's full

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,399
of

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,240
options and distractions but just

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,600
maybe ease up on that once you've got a

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,080
path because you don't want to burden

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,399
yourself

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,679
with this is my life now oh and you

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,720
start to spin

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,159
nothing's forever i want to also raise

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,360
the importance of knowing that okay i

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,840
didn't like that

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,200
so say some of you do heed some of this

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,720
advice if it's even advice

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,279
or you get inspired to go try something

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,320
different uh it's okay to not like

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,760
whatever you try

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,679
if you get to that point and you're like

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,720
oh just kidding this was not

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,000
what i thought because you know with an

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,520
asterisk around this

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,559
you can't always tell what the role's

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,919
gonna be from the outside until you're

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,600
in it you know like

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,520
descriptions are tough you gotta really

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,799
be in a place before you're like oh this

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,120
is not what i thought

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,880
my bad but that's good it's okay because

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,559
knowing what you don't like to me is as

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,480
is arguably as good as knowing what you

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,799
do like to help narrow down

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,399
options for yourself in the future to

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,240
keep yourself on a good path

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,520
and then my ultimate takeaway my last

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,399
slide here is

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,120
look for some bigger boxes i uh i was

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,279
able to

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,360
successfully navigate of course through

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,039
my you know i have privileges and just

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,720
the the wonderful network of people i

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,000
know too that always helps

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,760
but just being able to push and

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,760
challenge those notions of you have to

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,520
be this and that includes only this

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,720
and you can't bring this hat here

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,000
because i'm living proof that if you

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,159
kind of want to wiggle it in

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
um you probably find a role for yourself

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,240
somewhere along the lines to bring more

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
of yourself

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,200
and i think when we can bring more of

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,640
ourselves that's back to the keep it

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,320
human notion

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,080
uh we're we're actually sharing more uh

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,000
there's more vantage points more of that

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,000
inclusion around us and

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,279
able to create much better solutions

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,840
that speak to

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,120
humans on the other side so look for

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,000
those bigger boxes and

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,039
ways to bring more of yourself all right

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,640
that's all i got

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,000
but thank you so much artifacts for

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,799
having me i appreciate being able to

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,320
have this talk

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,240
especially after all the random

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,960
conversations i've had in various

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,039
dms about this so if anything struck you

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,960
you can find me on twitter i am a stream

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,200
of consciousness consciousness type so

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,240
fair warning i'm not gonna you're not

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,000
gonna be you're gonna make me feel bad

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,000
if you're like she's too much it's uh

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,960
just is what it is but either way here

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
to help thank you

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,520
um and thank you kristen we heartifacts

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,120
appreciate having you as well

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,360
um do you have a good pronunciation for

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,039
your twitter name uh it's mine

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,399
it's just kristen but in leet so it's

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,279
not really pronunciation it's just my

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,159
name and numbers

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,520
i was kidding yeah i'm very literal on

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,559
these i'm like maybe

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,240
her 5'7 that's fine

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,840
um one of the things i really liked was

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
you mentioning about how changing roles

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,399
are jobs

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,080
always results in you taking something

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,520
in the next position with you and one of

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,000
the things i found is

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,720
i call myself a polyglot engineer

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,159
because i

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,840
always it feels like at every job

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,919
working in a different language or

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,440
a totally different role and so i see a

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,360
lot of that transition

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,760
going from like the types of problems i

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,840
might solve kind of carry over

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,440
um and finding new ways to do things too

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,080
so i really like that

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,720
okay yeah do you think there's anything

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,760
to be said

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,679
for um maybe let's say a developer

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,120
trying to get at least a little bit of a

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,960
part in the product roles like you're

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,159
shadowing a pm or

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,919
you know or take on a

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,440
that's that's i mean sorry to cut you

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,120
off but i i see your head with that and

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,760
like part of me says yes immediately

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,760
because

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,320
i mean at least personally i love when

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,120
developers are like i want to get closer

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,559
to the end user i want to see what

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,159
they're dealing with and because more

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,200
often i'm used to developers who are

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,279
like kristin

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,320
i don't care about that i want to just

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,279
code over here

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,679
and i try to distill that as the po so

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,240
uh

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,840
thinking of my own software dev history

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,399
i had to tell my boss at the time i was

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,799
like

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,320
i really like working with people so and

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,720
i remember he was like really i was like

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,360
oh

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,960
wow i really thought that that was clear

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,320
so don't assume that you're

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,399
the people around you or the folks that

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,240
let you work in different capacities

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,919
know that you want to do that i would

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,080
highly recommend that you just

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,919
go talk to that manager or whomever and

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,640
say i'm very interested in this what can

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,159
we do

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,799
because i i just personally would be

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,919
very shocked if they're like nothing

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,760
they can probably bring you into some

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,240
user studies or whatever sort of

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,640
research that they do and please by all

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,960
means bring it closer to the code

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,080
yeah yeah i've always appreciated at

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,760
least at least like

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,440
dabbling a little bit in the other areas

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,600
just to be familiar with the other

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,039
pieces are kind of going exactly

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,320
um somebody had asked what do you think

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,159
you would have done differently if you'd

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,000
wanted to change roles but not within

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,159
the same organization

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,399
that one's trickier because i i honestly

00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,880
think i needed that internal

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,240
trust to make that kind of gap because i

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,919
kept thinking like could i have made

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,840
that same bridge to another company

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,760
without the backing that i had

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,120
in my current company so i don't take

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,039
that for granted i think that definitely

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,440
makes it a smoother transition

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,279
because i would have been knocking at

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,720
doors or products saying hey i've been a

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,000
software developer over here and all

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,960
this but like i really want to do

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,080
product and i think they would have been

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,200
like

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,559
so uh yeah there was that would have

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,799
been a bit different but it's hard to

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,519
say sometimes companies see what you

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,679
bring

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,640
just as a person too it's not so much

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,120
your resume and

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,320
bullets on it so i don't want to like

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,880
make anyone think it's going to be

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,960
possible

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,919
but it was definitely a smooth thing for

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,880
me

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,799
yeah um do you have any suggestions on

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,279
exploring like these alternate paths

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,159
without

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,600
actually switching those roles yeah so i

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,799
think it's a lot of just you have to do

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,679
a little bit of your own homework and

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,519
looking around of

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,799
what those rules mean maybe it's just if

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,559
you can ask people that are in your

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,799
company like what's your day-to-day like

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,679
uh what's i think shadow sessions are

00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,360
valid i

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,039
in my company i'm not a bigger company

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,080
but we do have people coming shadow and

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,799
they're from completely different

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,640
departments

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,399
and that's fair and if you don't have

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,960
something like that maybe

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,640
start it start a way to start showing

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,080
each other these different

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,600
skill sets because if that means that

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,880
you're bringing more of what you want to

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,519
do in your heart

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,960
for the for the role you have to the

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,559
table that's a huge win

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,320
you know i i personally think it's more

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,799
draining to try and fit myself in a

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,120
small box of like i'll just do only this

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,640
that's a lot harder on me than being

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,760
like oh can i go explore over here and

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,039
see what i can do over here too

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,720
no okay well so yeah just uh maybe just

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,559
ask around or

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,080
follow people on on social media i know

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,799
i'm following like a very

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,240
get back off of social media talk but i

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,279
do think social media is extremely

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,880
powerful for

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,799
learning what you can expect these

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,240
different roles so it can be a good tool

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,360
for that

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,000
yeah yeah um how do you notice if you're

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,080
blocking your

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,600
own growth like for example uh when

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,279
those assumptions in your head don't

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,360
really want to go away

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,799
yeah that one's tricky because you know

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,919
that's that's where i was having a hard

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,720
time painting out this

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,320
path because i kind of trust my gut

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,200
though if there's a point where i really

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,520
feel

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,359
like i'm i'm being more held back or my

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,079
hands are tied that's usually my tell of

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,440
okay

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,639
why do i feel this way is it is it

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,359
because i just don't align with the

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,040
style

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,560
is that the process that's not letting

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,760
me grow

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,040
the the management the leadership um so

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,399
more often not i'm going to assume it's

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,599
an external force that's holding me back

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,720
more than myself

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,159
but it's also i'm still working on

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,520
breaking that thought that i have to do

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,679
one thing and do it

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,200
you know forever and i think since i got

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,879
past that point

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,399
as the design thinking thing i've been

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,960
much better at going like what else can

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,520
i do

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,159
and i will warn you not every place is

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,679
up for that

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,919
you got to find the right places that

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,280
want you to be that person

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,480
because you know when i work at a bigger

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,399
company people are like stay in your

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,639
lane you're supposed to do this

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,760
but it's uh at the same time i think

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,399
people in the end know that you're just

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,119
trying to bring more of yourself in

00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,760
yeah uh were you able to inspire or

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,760
mentor

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,520
any peers or co-workers along the way

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,560
with your journey to consider these

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,599
alternate pastor

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,560
roles uh not so much on the path just

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,960
yet at least not

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,720
like directly i haven't been asked like

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,800
let's sit down and talk about real

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,960
shifts i think i did see light bulbs

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,240
along the way of people going whoo

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,920
i'll never forget one one of my old

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,800
co-workers i really looked up to him

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,800
still do

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,560
as a developer and i was like you're

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,680
such a good coder this is so you're so

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,520
good at what you do

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,880
i remember he shot back he's like yeah

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,720
but you can learn

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,240
code he's like the other elements of

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,359
like connecting business and people and

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,440
all these other departments he's like

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,960
that's a trickier thing and i was like

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,560
so i think that turned on some light

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,480
bulbs in my dev team of like

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,920
it's not all just about code you know

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,200
you got to kind of

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,760
breathe a little bit bring in some

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:59,839
humans here and and have more of these

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:59,839
discussions about what else is going on

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,560
