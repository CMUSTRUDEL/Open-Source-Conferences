A strength of the tech industry is its ability to facilitate remote work. Remote work helps people — particularly people who are part of marginalized communities, such as folks who are undergoing a gender transition. We often talk about how to foster inclusive teams and remote work can be a big factor in that!

In this talk, you’ll learn about barriers that disproportionately affect underrepresented folks in tech, like health concerns, financial/geographical logistics and emotional burnout, as well as the ways working remotely can ease those burdens, and how to promote healthy distributed teams.

through remote work

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,199
i have a intro slide

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,720

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
i've actually been there for five whole

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,720
days

so that's really exciting for me and i'm

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,360
on greater than code

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
which is a tech podcast about kind of

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,640
the human side of tech

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
which you can check out if you haven't i

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,240

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,920
and you can find me online pretty much

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,680

just please remember if you're going to

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
post about me publicly that i use they

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,880
them pronouns

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,880
thanks

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,119
but obviously what i really want to talk

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,799
about is remote work so i have a couple

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,479
of stats for the beginning

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
this is from the stack overflow

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,200
developers survey in 2019

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,040
um so you can see that even in the

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,840
before times of 2019

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
not there there were about 12 percent of

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,880
people who were full-time remote but

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,000
more people who worked remote at least

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,479
sometimes

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,879
so it is a thing i think it'll be really

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,800
interesting to see the 2020 stance

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,920
um but i'm going to talk more about that

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
later

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,879
um also in the stack overflow survey in

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,200
2017 they asked a question about like

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,000
what kind of priorities people have when

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,400
they're looking for a new

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
job what's important to them and 53

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,879
percent of people

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,879
said that remote options were a top

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,560
priority for them this is obviously

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,920
something that's important to people

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,840
and that we're all thinking about

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,440
uh personally i've been in tech for

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,959
about seven years

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,720
and i've been working remote the whole

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,920
time like 80 to 100

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,599
remote um and when i tell people that

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,840
it usually has a com we usually have a

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,160
conversation that goes a little bit like

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,239
this

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,599
uh and i know that from working with

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,440
other remote people

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,640
these kind of responses are annoying to

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,360
people

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,200
and i understand why overall um people

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,879
who have never worked remote sometimes

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,879
act like it's a walk in the park

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,800
and like it's not it's a real job you

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,680
have to get just as much work done as an

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,200
office job in fact i feel more guilty

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
about taking breaks or whatever when i'm

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,640
working from home

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,680
because in an office water cooler chat

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,280
is kind of a thing that happens

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,800
naturally

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
but at home it doesn't and it can be

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,840
isolating not having that kind of chat

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,360
this is an excerpt from a comic in the

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,959
oatmeal but i can

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,480
relate overall though

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,280
my response is more like this

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,400
because i really love working remote it

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,159
works for me

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,720
it helps me do my best work and it's

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,879
awesome so i want to talk about why that

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,879
is

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,280
and i think i'll start by talking about

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,640
some of just the general benefits from

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,840
of remote work because anybody might

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,040
have benefits it gives you more

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
flexibility

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
maybe you want to start your day a

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,959
little earlier a little later

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,599
that's usually fine maybe you have

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
things to do

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,319
at specific times during the day like

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,760
you have to pick up your kid from

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,519
daycare you can work around

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,319
that those kind of things normally more

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,799
easily than an office

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,319
not having to commute is gives you a lot

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,320
more flexibility too

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,600
this is a big one for me living in

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,120
buffalo a

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,199
because we don't have good public

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,520
transportation here and b

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,199
because we have bad weather and i don't

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,600
want to dig out my car in the winter

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,800
so this is this is great for me

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,720
it gives you the freedom to work from

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,479
anywhere um obviously we're not

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
traveling right now but normally i would

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,160
be traveling a lot and it's nice to be

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,800
able to work from wherever i go

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,639
like if i go to texas to visit my family

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,199
i don't have to take a week off

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,320
i can work during the day and spend time

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,440
with them in the evenings and it gives

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
me more time with my family

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,720
your mileage may vary with this one some

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,080
people find it difficult to work from

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,400
home and not get distracted

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,400
by home stuff it's really not for

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,759
everyone it's a personal preference

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,960
obviously this one's out the window

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,560
right now because we have lots of

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,000
distractions again i'm going to talk

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,360
more about that later

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,880
but personally i find that my

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
productivity is a lot better when i'm

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,160
working from home i don't have people

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,840
walking around me in an office

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
i don't have them coming up and talking

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,120
to me about things i can really go heads

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
down and like get work done

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,840
and i love that

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,240
plus just like being comfortable in your

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,000
space is like huge

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,800
it's not to be understated it's a big

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
factor for people

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,759
so again that list was kind of in

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,800
general and i think the word benefits is

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,160
kind of interesting

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,240
because it can kind of mean two

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,080
different things i read a lot of

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,199
definitions of the word benefits when i

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,759
was working on this talk

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,520
i like this one a lot of them also used

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,800
the word advantageous which i thought

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,080
was interesting

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,919
and it kind of gets at that first

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,039
definition of benefits it's something

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,639
that's nice to have

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,880
makes your life a little better a little

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
more convenient

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,120
but there's another way that we use the

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,720
term benefits like our benefits package

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
and there are people for whom remote

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,919
work is more than just a little bit of

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,840
extra convenience

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,960
some benefits make it possible to do

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,360
something that you wouldn't have been

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,639
able to otherwise do

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,199
and remote work is one of those things

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,880
for me so while it's cool to think about

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,319
what benefits you want to give people i

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,960
think it can be more

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,319
helpful to think about like what problem

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,160
or barrier you want to help them solve

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,840
normally here in this talk i would do a

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,319
couple of slides next about why it's

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,479
important to strive for a diverse team

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,160
i had to trim for time and that's what i

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,360
decided to trim because i figure that

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,520
anyone who's coming

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
to a conference like artifacts probably

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,080
already knows that diversity is

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,319
important

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,680
so i'm going to go straight into

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,759
examples of kind of different

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,000
demographics of people who might benefit

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,840
and what barriers and problems remote

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
work might be solving

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,960
first i'm going to talk about chronic

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,319
illness and disability this has to be

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,240
kind of general because there's lots of

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,599
different kind of illness and disability

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,800
and they have different challenges and

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,520
needs

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,759
that said i will disclose that i have

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
pretty severe anxiety disorder

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,720
and it's a big part of the reason that

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,599
working from home feels very critical

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,280
for me

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:16,960
um so i'm going to talk to my experience

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,560
about that specifically also

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,160
lots of different disabilities have

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,440
different accessibility

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
concerns and need different

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,680
accommodations it's likely that the best

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,319
ones are going to be at someone's own

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,919
house

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,759
where they can control all of the

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,919
variables and feel very comfortable in

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,560
the space

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,039
accessibility concerns can also kind of

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,240
go

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,720
flow into difficulties getting to work

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,800
but i've experienced that too before i

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,599
was fully remote i used to miss a ton of

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,240
work

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,919
because sometimes i just felt too bad to

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,560
get out of bed in the morning

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,680
but like i could still work if i could

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,160
work from my bed

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,080
in fact working helps me as a

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,759
distraction when i'm having bad anxiety

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,199
so it's wonderful to be able to work for

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,199
my bed when i'm having a bad day

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
flexible working hours are great for

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,560
everybody but some people need them for

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,479
more tangible reasons than other people

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,800
um if i have like a panic attack early

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,479
in the morning i pretty much need to go

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,560
back to sleep for a couple of hours or

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,879
i'm gonna be totally useless

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,319
so if i can start a little bit late and

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,639
work a little bit late

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,479
now there's a whole day that i'm working

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,759
that i would have otherwise had to like

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,319
call in sick

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,840
and miss the whole day but i don't need

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,360
the whole day

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,560
also if you have chronic illness and you

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,159
have frequent doctor's appointments

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,039
related to it that requires a lot of

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,039
flexibility too

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,839
energy conservation uh i do another talk

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,399
about spoon theory specifically which is

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,080
kind of a metaphor that describes how we

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,040
ration our energy

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,800
uh in a day the spoons are the the unit

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,839
of energy that we spend

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,760
and people with chronic illness have

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,959
to ration their energy in a more real

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,120
way than other people

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,800
and if you don't have to like get

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,680
dressed you don't have to commute to

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,120
work

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,399
those are things that might be taking up

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,920
a lot of energy especially if you have

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,080
like chronic pain

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,519
now you can spend that energy like going

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,519
straight into your day and that's great

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,519
also lots of people who struggle with

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,720
illness just have good days and bad days

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,080
and you might not want people to see

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,440
your bad days

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,519
for me that kind of means that if i have

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,120
a panic attack at home you know it sucks

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,959
i'm not having a great day

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
but if i have a panic attack at work it

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,200
feels really awful and it's really

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
embarrassing

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
so just being able to turn my video off

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
if i'm having a bad day like preserves a

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
lot of privacy

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,320
again this has to be really general

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,080
because i'm kind of like sweeping in a

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,360
lot of different underrepresented

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,600
groups of people in tech but i think

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,600
energy conservation is a big thing again

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
uh spoon theory was really invented

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
specifically to talk about chronic

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,839
illness

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,760
but i do think underrepresented folks

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,640
have to use more energy at work for a

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,200
few different reasons

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,760
code switching is one of them we often

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,839
talk about

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,399
bringing your whole self to work it's

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,640
really nice in theory i try to do it

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,240
but realistically nobody really does it

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
because of course the way you talk to

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,399
your co-workers is different than the

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,920
way you talk to your friends and family

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,079
and that's much more true if you're not

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,839
part of like the majority in group

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,000
this might mean that like the slaying

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,240
you'd use around your friends that are

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,079
from your same ethnic group is different

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,839
for me it means that the way i talk

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,120
around a group where everyone is queer

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,120
is very different

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,040
and there's an energy across associated

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,160
with making those kind of decisions

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,160
about how you communicate

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,240
microaggressions i could do a whole talk

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,440
on but basically what i'm talking about

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,839
here is like small

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,680
indirect often unintentional

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,600
discriminations against minority groups

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,279
and these things happen in the office

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,839
this might be things like off-color

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,800
jokes you know making assumptions about

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,399
people

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,279
for me getting misgendered is a big

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,720
example they're small

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,160
they might not be malicious but they

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,160
still add up and take energy

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,200
i think this is related actually this

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,839
idea of like fitting in

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,360
someone once told me a story of working

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,120
at a series of jobs where they were the

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,320
only latino in the office and they

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,800
always felt like none of their

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,079
co-workers really fully understood them

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,320
and then they worked at a place for the

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,839
first time that was 100 remote

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,519
and there were people from all over the

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,839
world on that team

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,839
and they felt for the first time like oh

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,800
everyone here is different from everyone

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,800
else so i don't

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,160
stick out in any way we're all just

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,040
coming together

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,399
i thought that story was really cool and

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,839
they expressed to me that like it was a

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,839
really good feeling

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,279
it can also be really expensive to work

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,639
like think about someone who's coming

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,800
from an underprivileged back

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,320
underprivileged background who just did

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,160
a boot camp and they're like out looking

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,160
for their first tech job

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,920
maybe they can't afford a nice wardrobe

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,760
to wear to the office yet

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,200
maybe everyone wants to go out to lunch

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,480
and they can't afford that and it makes

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,720
them feel left out

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,680
even transportation to and from work

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,360
might be a problem

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,839
and you're cutting all of those concerns

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,839
right out

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,279
i think location-based diversity is

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,800
actually really interesting

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,040
because people who come from different

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,360
places and live in different places

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,040
and have different backgrounds have

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,720
different perspectives and having a lot

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,920
of different perspectives on your team

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,760
makes it better and more thoughtful

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,680
but there's lots of reasons why people

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,880
might not be able to live in major urban

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,800
areas where a lot of tech

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,839
jobs are first of all it's extremely

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,839
expensive

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,480
to live in like new york or san

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,480
francisco

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,079
people might have family obligations

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,839
that they don't want to move away

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,600
to the big city and like leave their

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,279
family behind

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
that might be more common in other

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,320
cultures other than like american

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,160
culture

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,839
because people think about their family

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,839
in a different way which is super valid

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,680
it's great to have people from other

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,000
countries on your team too but they

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
might

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,240
not be able to easily like physically

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,639
come to the states and work at your

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,639
office

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,839
these are all things that might affect

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,000
anybody

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,839
but i think they disproportionately

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,160
affect people from underrepresented

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,360
backgrounds because

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,279
they come from different cultures

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,079
different places a lot of us come from

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,639
under

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,120
privileged backgrounds so this is kind

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,480
of

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,480
hitting hard on that group again

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,680
i do want to talk specifically about the

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:42,160
trans community for a few reasons

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,760
um i'm trans talk about what you know

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,440
there's a lot of trans people working in

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,800
tech though and it's growing

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,399
which means the likelihood that you

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,199
already have a trans person on your team

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,000
or you will

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,440
or more than one is like growing and

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,320
understanding this perspective will help

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,480
you be a better coworker

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,720
i also think the reason that that is is

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,680
because not all industries

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,360
you can work remote but you can in tuck

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,600
and i think remote jobs can be really

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,199
uniquely attractive to trans people

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,199
so i'll talk about the reasons why

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,839
transitioning at work is really hard

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,639
actually transitioning in general is

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,560
really hard

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,399
it's just a huge change in one's life

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,320
for the better but like any period of

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,000
intense change is really hard

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
plus you also have to worry about if

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,560
people are going to be respectful of you

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,399
which is frustrating but even if you're

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,040
in a good situation where everyone at

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,959
your job

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,959
wants to be respectful of you which

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,639
unfortunately isn't always the case

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,199
but even if so there are still unique

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,199
challenges

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,680
a lot of trans people have a lot of

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,800
baggage about like clothes and their

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,399
wardrobe

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,760
that can be make it really hard to

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,839
navigate like business casual

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,519
also a lot of people have to essentially

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,240
replace their entire wardrobe when they

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,920
come out

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,079
and that's really tough to do all at

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,480
once and it happens over time

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,519
so newly out trans people often don't

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,519
have a lot of clothes

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,720
it's hard to explain how stressful it is

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,000
to use the bathroom in public when

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,399
you're trans

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,880
you might have some of an idea from

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,680
seeing like bathroom laws on the news

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,279
um but trust me it's just better for me

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,839
to use the gender neutral bathroom my

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,839
own house

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,360
um i feel super self-conscious about my

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,320
appearance a lot of times but if that's

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,759
not bad enough

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,759
transitioning often comes with like

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,040
awkward teenage phases especially if

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,600
you're on hormones

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,720
um it can be very uncomfortable to be

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,079
seen every day

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,920
so it can be a relief to just be able to

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,440
turn off the camera again

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,440
also some people really want to keep

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,240
their transition private um which is

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,839
super valid

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,880
this idea of just like emerging out of a

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,880
cocoon i get it

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,360
even well-meaning co-workers are

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,320
sometimes going to mess up on name and

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,920
pronouns

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,519
uh it's easier to practice and get it

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,639
right over text-based communication

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,759
because you can be more thoughtful and

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,199
catch yourself

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,720
in my old company everyone's really

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,320
respectful on slack they always got it

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,920
right but in person

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,440
um people slipped up and it made it like

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,600
really tough for me

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,120
also it's anxiety-inducing to correct

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,120
people and it's easier over text

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,800
plus like not all trans people have

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,560
surgeries but a lot of us do i did

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,000
uh two years ago and i was worried about

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,320
taking off time from work but

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,600
i ended up being able to take off less

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,880
time than i thought because

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,880
i couldn't really get up and move around

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,320
but again i could work

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
and people weren't perceiving my

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,560
physical form while i was recovering

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,560
which was nice

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,199
so we've talked about the benefits of

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,199
remote work but there's also cons

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,800
um there's already a lot of articles

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,560
that go into the challenges of remote

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,839
work and give tips

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,600
now that we're in the situation we're in

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,519
we're seeing a lot more of that which is

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040
nice because it's nice that people who

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,120
are already good at remote work want to

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,880
support people who are new to it

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,720
but actually the phrase already good at

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,040
remote work is kind of what i'm getting

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,000
at this remote mindset

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,240
remote work isn't easy it takes work it

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,240
doesn't come naturally to everyone

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,240
but it's a skill that you can practice

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,000
and get better at

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,600
a healthy remote environment doesn't

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,120
just happen

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,480
you have to be intentional about what

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,039
you want to look like and how you're

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,039
going to get there

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
so i'm going to talk about some tips um

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,559
some specific ones

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,039
first i want to talk about text-based

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,839
communication not all communication for

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,400
remote people

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,160
is via text but like a ton of it is i

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,000
think these tips will help anybody but i

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,440
do think that they'll particularly help

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
people like me who struggle with mental

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,200
illness so this is kind of like personal

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,400
stuff

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,440
there's reasons why text-based

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,360
communication is works for me

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,039
one of my anxiety symptoms is memory

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,080
lamps so it's really helpful to be able

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
to go back and review

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,360
exactly what people said later to

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,360
remember the context of it

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,200
being put on the spot with questions is

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,520
also anxiety inducing for me

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,039
so async culture helps a lot with that

00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,760
but even if someone needs an answer

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,440
right away

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,799
i still get to think a little bit more

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,720
about how i'm going to word it when i'm

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,280
typing

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,880
but it can be tough too my anxiety makes

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,200
me worry a lot about tone and i read

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,720
into people's words a lot

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,400
so i think it's important to err on the

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,000
side of over communicating

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,320
you know tell me explicitly if your

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,080
inquiry is urgent or non-urgent

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,520
don't be afraid afraid to just clarify

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,320
your tone even if it feels a little

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,240
awkward

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,200
it sounds silly but i think emojis can

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,960
really like convey some nuance sometimes

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,360
my old company had a slack emoji wyc

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,960
which stood for when you can um it's

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,720
actually an acronym that my dad and i

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,039
made up when i was like growing up

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,720
because he would text me and be like

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,080
call me and then i would freak out like

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,760
why what's going on and i would call him

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,200
in a panic and he wanted to tell me like

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,200
a funny story

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,880
so we invented when you can to kind of

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,039
denote it's not important in that way

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,720
and that's about context too the worst

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,559
possible thing for my anxiety is like

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,919
can you hop on a call right now

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,280
because then i'm like what is it urgent

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,559
am i in trouble what's it about does

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,240
something bad happen is someone getting

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,480
fired am i getting fired

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,919
i'm reading into it like a thousand ways

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
if you just said hey can you cop on a

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,799
call right now

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,799
it's time sensitive but not an emergency

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,640
and it relates to this project

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,640
it's a few more seconds to type out but

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
it cuts out a lot of anxiety on my end

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,840
you're already kind of doing the first

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,679
step to becoming a good advocate by

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,720
listening to me talk right now

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,559
getting a sense of some of these

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,039
perspectives is like a really good first

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,080
step

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,559
i also have some actionable tips

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,640
i love this idea of remote first culture

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,679
even if not everybody is remote

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,320
remote first when some people are remote

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,919
and others

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,280
aren't the remote people tend to miss

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,160
out on conversations that are happening

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,760
in person

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
that might mean socially just not

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,520
getting to know people as well

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,919
but that could mean you're passed up for

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,200
opportunities sometimes people even get

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,280
left out of conversations that are

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,880
relevant to projects that they work on

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,000
like not maliciously two people just

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
meet in the hall like hey let's talk

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,320
about that project

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,640
but it makes it really hard to work

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,679
effectively when you're not included

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,440
these are all things that

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,880
underrepresented folks already struggle

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,559
more with than other people

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,039
so remote work if done wrong can make

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,039
that worse

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,440
if you notice someone being left out

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,120
just say something hey we should talk

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,760
about that project but we should include

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,200
jamie

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,000
let's wait until we can get them on a

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,480
call with us

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,120
one's kind of a personal pet peeve but i

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,559
hate

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,240
being on a call where there's like a

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,640
bunch of people in a room together

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,159
and then a few people have called in i

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,520
cannot keep up with the conversation

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,679
that's happening in that room

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,720
there's lag there's noise i can't speak

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,720
up fast enough

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,559
it literally makes me feel more left out

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,960
than just not inviting me

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,640
to a meeting in my old company i

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,159
complained a lot about this and then we

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,679
started making everyone phone in

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,039
individually like all the people at the

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,240
office had their own laptop and

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,080
headphones

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,360
and it was way better even though they

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,480
were together i felt like i was on the

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,480
same playing field as them

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,640
i could not possibly cover all

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,960
microaggressions as i said

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,880
but in general a good way to support

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,799
underrepresented folks in the workplace

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,480
is to get better at identifying

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,520
microaggressions so that you

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,360
a you cannot do them and b

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,960
you can stop other people when they do

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,640
them

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,080
uh i'm going to talk about a couple that

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,600
are like super relevant to some of the

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,600
specific things i've already brought up

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,320
don't comment on people's appearance

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,679
there's no reason it only makes people

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,120
feel uncomfortable

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,280
i don't mean like i like your new

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,640
haircut but like maybe someone's looking

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,720
under the weather

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,760
maybe they have like some awkward acne

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
that they're going through

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,080
maybe they're wearing their pajamas it's

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,200
just easy and cost zero dollars not to

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,840
say anything about

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,919
it and make them feel weird about it

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,360
a lot of places push for video on all

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,039
the time during calls

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,320
i actually really get that i do think

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,000
there's value in that it's like

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,120
fostering more of a relationship between

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,559
coworkers

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,320
but if there's someone who has to keep

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,000
their video off sometimes there's

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,039
probably a reason that they feel more

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
comfortable with that

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,039
so again just don't make them feel weird

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,039
about it

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,039
correct pronouns are not just for when

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,640
you're with somebody

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,039
this is something i get a lot of stress

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,039
about like if there are people in person

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,280
together in an office and i'm remote

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,960
i worry a lot like am i getting

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,559
misgendered in the office when i'm not

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,159
there to hear it

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,159
just don't let that happen it's

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,840
disrespectful it's also

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,240
bad practice for when you are with that

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,440
person makes it more likely to slip up

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,720
and then you're going to make them feel

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,240
bad

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,320
i do want to add a caveat to this that

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,679
it's pretty personal not all trans folks

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,440
want you to like correct other people

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,799
when they're not there

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,880
so it's maybe something you should like

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,320
ask and talk about but like

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,679
i would really appreciate this and i

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,679
think that's true of a lot of people

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,400
i would be remiss if i didn't talk

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,000
specifically about the situation that

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,679
we're in right now

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,280
um i wrote this talk actually before

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,799
the pandemic and then i gave it for the

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,520
first time after the pandemic so that

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,400
was weird

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,919
to for my topic to become so topical but

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,360
it is topical because there are lots of

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,960
people who are working from home for the

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,559
first time right now

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,559
um if you're one of those people welcome

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,240
in some ways it's kind of a huge

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,600
revolution there's a lot of people who

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,280
have been trying to advocate

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,280
about why remote work would work for

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,480
them for like all of the reasons that i

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,000
just said

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,559
and a lot of companies were telling them

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,600
like well we can't

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:36,240
well guess what we obviously can

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,840
because we are and we had to figure it

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,360
out

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,840
and i think that it's going to be kind

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,440
of hard to put it back in that box

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,799
if someone has been pushing that remote

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,840
work would be helpful for them and you

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,520
said we can't

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,600
it's going to be hard to tell them like

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,440
well we can't again so come back to the

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,200
office

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,640
on the other hand i think a lot of

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,919
people who are working

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,640
from home right now for the first time

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,520
are saying like well this sucks

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,039
well guess what of course it sucks

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,159
because we're in a pandemic and

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,559
everything sucks

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,600
you know suddenly becoming remote um

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,840
during covid

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,880
is like not a healthy remote environment

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,480
which again you really have to foster

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,320
it's not what remote work is normally

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,520
like you're not under

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,919
you're not normally under all this

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,400
stress you're not normally stuck in your

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,480
house

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,520
all the time with your spouse who's also

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,960
working from home

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,159
and like your kids who can't go to

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,919
school and it's so distracting

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
i do have worries that people are just

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,960
gonna have experienced remote work in

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,440
this way and be like well our

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,200
work sucks it doesn't suck being in a

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,880
global pandemic sucks

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,159
remote work is great for a lot of people

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,159
although again it's not for everyone

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,960
so i'm really curious what's going to

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,679
happen you know in the future a year

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,720
from now

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,400
a couple of years from now it's hard to

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,240
even really speculate about it in a lot

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,679
of ways because gosh dang it we just

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,080
don't know what the world is going to be

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,080
like in a few months

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,159
um i gave this talk for the first time a

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,919
few months ago and i said that and i had

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,159
no idea what it was gonna be like right

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,760
now and it's still true

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,440
um but i do think that while we're in a

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,760
tough situation right now

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,840
if we're intentional about it we can let

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,520
it change the landscape in ways that are

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,400
exciting and are going to help

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,400
people long term if we integrate remote

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,159
work as just a more standard part of our

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,080
lives

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,720
you know i think if we try to treat this

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,559
like an opportunity as best we can

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,480
we'll be able to reap benefits long term

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,120
even from being in this like really bad

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,120
situation

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,000
and i think that would be great if

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,000
something good can come out of it

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,039
i will post this on slack so don't worry

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,799
about this right now

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,120
but this is just a couple of their talks

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,679
um the my spoon theory talk from

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,919
railsconf 2017 which i mentioned

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,679
um things i wish i knew before going

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,799
remote by marla zasheen

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,960
was a talk at railsconf2019

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,880
like i said there's lots of remote work

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,799
talks but i happen to like this one a

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,600
lot

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,600
uh trans eye for the cis ally was given

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,000
by my friend julian fitzpatrick

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,440
a really excellent talk that goes more

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,640
in depth into some of the things that i

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,320
didn't have time for

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,679
like uh bathrooms and like

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,919
kind of really gives you a good

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,320
perspective on what your trans coworkers

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,320
might be thinking at any given time

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,320
um that was also from railsconf 2019.

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,520
um but overall just thank you thank you

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,520
for listening this is really important

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,240
to me it's great to be part of

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,120
a conference like artifacts um even like

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,799
especially now

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,440
it's so great that we can still be doing

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,799
some events um it's hard to give talks

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,880
virtually so

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,720
i'm looking forward to talking to people

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,600
after um and getting a little bit of

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,240
feedback

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,520
but you know stay safe stay healthy it's

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,080
really important

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,679
um and i think i'm gonna answer some

00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,880
questions like approximately right now

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,039
uh you are approximately correct um yeah

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,000
so thank you jamie for your talk it was

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,520
really great

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,440
um i really liked all the points at the

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,279
end where he talked about you know

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,640
there's remote work but also we're kind

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,400
of in this room at work during a

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,039
pandemic which happens to be different

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,120
and i remember scott hanselman tweeting

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,200
that he had worked from home for

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,799
like at least 12 years i don't remember

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,480
what the number was and how he said

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,399
um this is the first time he's been

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,360
absolutely exhausted

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,559
doing it just from the pandemic um by

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,679
the way this is my co-host

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,960
theodosius so say hi giving us a very

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,240
um authentic remote experience right now

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,279
yes i like your way of mentioning that

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,559
um somebody had asked uh do you have

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,600
thoughts on

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,480
good or bad ways of hopefully not too

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,919
many bad ways

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,559
um to give fully or mostly remote work

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,200
folks opportunities specifically for

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,720
social interaction

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,880
yeah i think it's kind of interesting

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,720
because we're seeing a lot of

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,159
we're trying a lot of different things

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,840
right now um

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
at that like we're trying even during

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,799
this conference we're trying having like

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,200
these discussion rooms and these

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,799
breakout rooms in the hallway track

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,320
at my job like i mentioned i just

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,880
started a new job

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,320
um and like normally i would go in to

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,159
their office for

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,360
onboarding but i haven't been able to so

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,039
they've scheduled me like

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,720
half hour virtual coffee dates basically

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,240
with a bunch of my new co-workers and

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,000
they're like just talk for a half hour

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,279
like not about work

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,600
um and it's been really that's been

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,159
really great um so i think it's kind of

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,000
like just being aware of it is like the

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,720
really big first step like if you

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,760
are if you realize that your remote

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,000
folks aren't getting the same

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,679
opportunities then you can

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,960
try to be intentional about that but if

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,600
you don't think about it and don't

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,720
realize

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,679
that's when it's it gets really bad i

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,080
guess

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,000
but i am keeping an eye out for like

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,440
what works and what doesn't work about

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,880
social like online social activities

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,600
so i'll keep you updated and somebody

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,200
had mentioned

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
uh are there ways to do it without

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,480
involving zoom calls and jackbox games

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,399
which

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,320
um i think our talk from jenny bramble

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,760
on saturday she helped mention a few of

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,880
these things so hopefully we can answer

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,640
those then

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,240
um some may have wondered is there a way

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,399
to respectfully share a busy home so not

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,159
um hurting the space that your kids or

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,279
spouse might have with any of your work

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,919
related stress

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,880
oh that's that one's really tough um i'm

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,679
lucky because

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,120
i mentioned being in a busy home but i'm

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,080
actually personally

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,440
not in one so not to rub it in but i

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,279
think in general like

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,799
a general tip with remote work is that

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,159
it's really important to have

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,840
like a designated remote space um

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,000
even if you're not sharing a busy home

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,840
just the idea of like this is the seat

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,520
i'm sitting in when i'm working and when

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,279
i sit in the seat i'm working

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,039
and when i go sit in another room i'm

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,000
not working because like the line

00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,840
between

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,600
working and not working can be really

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,840
tough when you're remote sometimes

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,360
so that's a tip you'll hear a lot and i

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,279
think that like

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,799
if you're serious about respecting that

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,000
kind of space

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,880
um like that kind of ties into

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,720
what is being asked to there but i don't

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,440
know if you don't have enough space to

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,200
do that it's just really tough

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,200
i used to go and like work at the coffee

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,600
shop a lot and obviously

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,320
i haven't really been able to do that

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,399
but

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,679
my local coffee shop i missed it so much

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,720
when i was closed

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,600
that like i went and sat on the benches

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,600
outside of it

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,799
they used to like put out tables and

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,919
they're not putting out tables right now

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,480
because they're not open

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,919
so i brought my own like tv tray table

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,240
and set it up and like

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,360
worked outside of my coffee shop by

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,360
myself

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:53,360
and it felt better brilliant i

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,360
really kind of like that um

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,880
one of my co-working spaces has closed

00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,960
just for

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,240
uh safety things so i've been very kind

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,760
of curious

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,799
uh no i'm trying to think through like

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,200
where can i go that doesn't evolve

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,200
like where can i take a tv's tray it

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,519
feels great to work outside actually i

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,039
totally recommend it if you can

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,679
yeah um so i was also kind of curious

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,600
you know in theory this pandemic will

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,679
eventually subside and we won't live in

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,360
a weird dystopian world anymore

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,720
um you had a lot of great suggestions

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,279
for remote work

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,399
um and theory we're gonna go back to an

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,799
in-person world

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,240
um how do you think might be a good way

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,440
to make sure we achieve

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,679
inclusivity um when we do early some of

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,000
us

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,000
transition back to in-person offices

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,080
yeah that's a good question i think that

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,240
like

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,159
in terms of inclusivity in general in

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,519
offices that's kind of like a big one

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,240
that we could talk about

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,360
for a long time for me it's all about

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
respect

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,440
i do think that like it's going to be

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,480
interesting when we go back to in-person

00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,840
offices

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,600
for kind of the reason i was getting it

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,880
at the end like not everyone's gonna

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,720
want to

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,840
and i think that that's really valid and

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,799
i hope that we can like be thoughtful

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,279
and mature

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,440
about deciding how we're gonna go back

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,080
and like how we're gonna let

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,760
people make that decision for themselves

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,240
and i'm kind of hoping that this will

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,159
happen naturally because like

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,279
as things are starting to open back up

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,360
right now

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,360
not everybody some people are like

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,720
starting to

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,960
do some stuff some people you know i go

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,159
out and do things with my mask and i go

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,000
to the grocery store

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,600
and you know um i'm careful but i'm out

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,720
at about a little bit but some people

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,840
still aren't at all

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,000
and like not wanting to be out

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,200
and about as super valid and so i think

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,600
that when we first start opening offices

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,840
like the only reasonable thing you can

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,840
do is let people choose whether or not

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,960
they feel comfortable coming back yet

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,039
because it's not like

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,360
covid's gonna get turned off one day

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,200
it's gonna like get slowly better

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,880
and so i'm hoping that if we already

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,880
have to kind of

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,039
approach it that way it'll make it more

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,679
easier it'll make it easier overall to

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,799
say

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,600
well why don't we let people choose if

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,880
like what they feel comfortable doing my

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,880
last job

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,120
was based in new york city and i was in

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,720
buffalo so obviously i was remote

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,120
but some of the engineering team like

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,799
was physically in new york city

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,880
and like they still didn't go into the

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,799
office because like the office

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,320
um environment like didn't work as well

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,000
for them and i thought it was like cool

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,840
that my company was giving them that

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,480
option to work remote even though like

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:53,840
they were

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:53,840
physically capable of coming in yeah

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,800
