When we scale our system and they break, we have procedures in place to understand, document, and fix the issues. 2020 has amplified our what marginalized communities have been saying for years. These systems where never made with us in mind. Itâ€™s time for to acknowledge the role technology plays in changing the systems that never worked everyone.

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,760
successful self-taught developer

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,359
valerie started tech by choice to give

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,160
back to the community that helped her

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,400
succeed

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,399
she's here to share about awakening the

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,880
awakening and the systems that support

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,399
it

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,640
and i'll pass it over to valerie now

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,480
so yeah today i'm going to be talking

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,520
about the awakenings in the system that

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,440
support it

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,960
and i know with everything that's going

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,800
on in today's world it's hard to tune in

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,879
to a lot of things because it's hard to

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,480
focus so i just want to say thank you to

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,640
everyone who's tuned in

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,079
and sharing space with me today i really

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,800
appreciate it

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,960
i had an amazing intro so i don't have

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,600
to talk that much about myself which is

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,159
great

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,320
because i am an awkward person uh and we

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,960
need to have less time with me being

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,080
awkward

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,040
recorded out there on the internets so i

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
appreciate that

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,799
i just want to go ahead and throw out

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,439
there that tech by choice is a community

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,920
for all

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,799
underrepresented groups and we try to

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
help people

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,840
learn that tech is a place for them

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,240
and we do that in a very authentic way

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,400
by making sure that we cover vocational

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,600
skills as well as career and personal

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,720
development

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,759
just yesterday we had a open and honest

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,840
discussion about

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
mental health so that's really cool and

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,240
some of the stuff that we work on

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840
if you want to connect with me my handle

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,479
is digital blk

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,600
hippie i'm on twitter a lot when i'm not

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,240
doing community work

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,000
and coding uh so yeah let's continue the

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,680
conversation there i'm i'm

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,280
on that platform way too much

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,280
so i'm going to go ahead and jump into

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,360
this talk

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
and when i was working on this talk and

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,439
creating the slides i realized that

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,600
in order to have a discussion about

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,239
racism we have to be honest

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,000
and i was looking at the title and i

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,400
realized that the title i originally

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,560
came up with was a disservice to

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
marginalized communities and individuals

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,440
who've been speaking up about

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,720
the injustices and how these systems

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,040
that are created

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,879
were never created equally they were

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,239
never created with

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,360
everyone in mind and they were not

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,440
created so that

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,400
marginalized communities can succeed in

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,760
them

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,280
so it's not it was not marginalized

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,519
people who were asleep

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,800
it was other people who refused to

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,000
listen to the lived

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,760
experiences of these communities and

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
really take it in and be active

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,920
listeners to what's going wrong

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,599
who are now waking up and so

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,120
i know with everything that's been going

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,440
on with 2020

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,319
i feel like one of the main things that

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,000
is changing

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,879
is that we're starting to notice that

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,800
the that we're having a white awakening

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,519
and we're starting to notice the systems

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,519
that support it

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,560
and i know i'm saying that it's a white

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,360
awakening

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
but i want to make a point to to

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,920
everyone

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,280
that is not just white people who are

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,319
becoming aware

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,480
instead it's this imperialistic mindset

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,920
that's based off of racism and

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,400
colonization

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,159
and all of these other things that

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,959
created periods like the manifest

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,959
destiny

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,159
and many others that i can point out in

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,959
our history

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,599
that has caused a number of people to

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,760
treat

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,200
marginalized communities across the

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,680
globe differently

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,799
if we look at western western

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,319
communities

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,519
and western civilizations we know that

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,720
there are a group of people who don't

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,640
have european

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,599
standards of beauty and they're treated

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,439
differently the same way people who

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,640
have different religious backgrounds are

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,120
treated differently

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,920
and how the world views darker skin

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,040
tones

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,000
as a negative the same way that gender

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,879
expressions

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,840
that fall out of the binary are viewed

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,120
as wrong

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,320
in the same way that when your sexuality

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,320
is not hetero it's seen as strange

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,320
these are all ideals that come out of

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,479
these systems that were not designed for

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,479
us

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,320
and there's one that's very important

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,520
that i want to talk about

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,639
and i want to say that transphobia kills

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,960
we know that we understand that but it's

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,960
still running rampant in our communities

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,960
and it's not always

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,960
white communities who are causing and

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,199
benefiting from this harm

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,320
we understand that these ideals stem

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,960
from racism

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,360
and parallelism and things like that but

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,520
we

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,680
need to understand that people who

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,639
benefit from these systems

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,960
are the people who are still in power so

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,280
no matter how deadly these viewpoints

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
are

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,199
and the behaviors that these systems

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
support

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,080
they're going to be people who either

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,320
are from those communities in power

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,440
or those who are trying to gain some

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,840
type of power

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,440
that gonna uplift some of these isms

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,759
whether it's sexism racism

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,080
homosexuality ableism uh there there's

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,160
just

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,520
a long list of things that we want to

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
rid of this world

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,560
but it's being uphold because the the

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,960
way the system was designed

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,160
is that these patterns and tendencies

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,720
and behaviors

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
are ones that are easy to fall back on

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
if we don't

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
take a moment to pause and ask questions

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,720
and really think about

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,919
the policies that we uh create

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,960
or the environments that we work in

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,560
and this is especially true when we look

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,039
at how

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,120
all of these behaviors and systems play

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,240
out in tech

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,319
because tech is just a microcosm of the

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
bigger world that we live in

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,400
i mean if we look at the globe as a

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,199
whole the systems that are in place

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,880
here can be replicated everywhere else

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,520
in the world and we see it

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,280
and we understand that but the one thing

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,880
that is different and it makes it hard

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
for some people to

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,240
pinpoint these actions and see where

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,560
they stem from

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
is the fact that it manifests in

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,520
different ways depending on the

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,120
environment

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,080
so how can we break this down in tech

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,160
i recently have understood what site

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,440
reliability engineering

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,720
is uh but and i think it's funny because

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,560
these theories and these structures

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,280
are something that i've been using in my

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,800
life just to understand and how

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,639
understand how to fix day-to-day things

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,080
but now that i understand and i have

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,440
this vocabulary with

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,560
site reliability engineering or sre

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,880
i now understand how i can apply this to

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,479
everyday life

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,599
so i found this chart it mimics the

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,479
milo's hierarchy of needs but

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,520
in the sre realm so it starts off with

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,039
monitoring

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,360
these are the things that we put in

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,520
place to see how an application is doing

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
and if it ever goes down at any point

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,599
and if it does go down we go and step up

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,479
in the pyramid and we

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,120
go into incident reporting depending on

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,319
the issue

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,599
that happens or arises it gets shoot

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,160
it gets passed off to someone who can

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,599
debug it and try to fix it and after

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,479
that fix is

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,680
in there we do a postmortem and from

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,120
that postmortem

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,919
we are able to understand

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
what the call root cause was and try to

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,800
really

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
take a moment to reflect on different

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,479
things that we can do

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,360
and tests that we can put in place to go

00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,319
ahead and make sure that going forward

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
once we try to scale the application

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,039
that we

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,840
are planning to and making sure that we

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,560
do not

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,120
have those issues come back up and if

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
they do

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,000
we know how to handle them and so once

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,560
you have that solid foundation

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,039
you're able to build out and architect

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,000
this

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,479
amazing application with the front and

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
back and databases and all that stuff

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,919
and then you're able to take this to

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,440
production and

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,960
have it used by other people

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,240
so i understand that in tech we have all

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,479
these systems that

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,399
we build out and we have all these

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,719
policies and procedures

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,479
that are built in to understand if it's

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,839
working or and if it's not

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,160
and we also know if and when we need to

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,240
do things to make it better

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,839
so why not use this same system to

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,560
figure out what's not working in our

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,959
cultures

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,760
we need to use this system to debug the

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,880
systems that

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,880
are now being amplified in 2020

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,680
so using that thought process i decided

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,000
to break down

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,920
some of the things that i've noticed and

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,640
witnessed in tech over the last few

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,519
months

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,040
and try to relate it back to the bigger

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,800
systems at play

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,800
and i started off with the lack of

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,760
monitoring that is happening in the tech

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
industry

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,519
a lot of these companies we never know

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,640
what's going wrong

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,640
until it blows up

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,320
some of the companies that i listed here

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,279
like gatsby just a few days ago we had

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,800
a contractor shared their experience

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,760
experience of working

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,120
at gatsby and how negative it was and

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,160
how

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,640
all of those systems at play came out in

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
ways

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,800
that create an environment that wasn't

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,519
welcoming to

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,800
a lot of people and it even came to

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,760
light that some of the stuff that they

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,720
were doing were

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,839
was illegal and then we have companies

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,360
like pinterest

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,120
who recently over the years have been

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,040
getting more and more recognition

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,120
recognition for having

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,320
features that highlight diversity and

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,880
inclusion

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,240
but we had three black women come out

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,640
and say that they

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,800
they felt like they were underpaid and

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,760
they faced racist comments

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
and when they spoke up about this and

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,519
tried to

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,959
get those themes to change and to make

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,800
sure that they weren't working in a

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,000
hostile environment

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,760
they were subject to retaliation

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,480
because they were trying they raised

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,800
those complaints

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,160
and then you have lambda school it's a

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,640
coding boot camp and

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,360
in tech we know that boot camps are the

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,839
center of a lot of controversial themes

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,920
but there is one article that i recently

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,440
came across about land the school

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,600
that was news to me it was a former

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,959
employee who was speaking out about the

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,560
problems she saw

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,480
with the way that they were handling

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,560
diversity with their students

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,399
and she also highlighted some of the

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,600
ways that she experienced it

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,240
experienced microaggressions and racism

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,120
while working there and the company was

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,880
actually coming

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,399
after her and trying to sue her for

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,399
speaking out about those things

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,160
now if we look at the bigger system at

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,160
play we see that

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,920
the what's going on here is the control

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,560
of power

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,519
when you have these systems in play in

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,839
order to

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,760
keep your power and to stay on top you

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,279
have to limit the access

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,320
so that other people can't reach the top

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,120
and take you down so there's no real way

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,320
for us to do those reportings

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,920
and there's no real way for us to get a

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,279
health check on these companies

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,160
without it caught without some

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,800
irreversible damage happening and we

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,079
find out

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,320
after the fact

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,000
one of the solutions i came up with is

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
that we should start using

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,079
self-reporting tools

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,120
like good job good job helps keep the

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,760
pulse on

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
on organizational health through and

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,800
it's

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,440
and because it's a third-party app it

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,160
increases transparency and reduces bias

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
because

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,320
you're not questioning if the company uh

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,639
changed the numbers

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,519
to make them look good it's it's not

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,000
their tool

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,959
it's just the employees reporting how

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,480
they feel

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,720
and what the environment is actually

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,720
like

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,160
now we move on to instantly reporting

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,440
insane reporting

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,040
is sometimes very unclear in these tech

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,880
organizations

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,800
it could be unclear because there is a

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,320
lack of policies and you don't know who

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,399
to talk to

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,600
when something goes wrong or you don't

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,720
even know what

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,519
you can and can't or can and shouldn't

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,440
report it's just no one really knows

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,800
these things

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,880
and then you have to deal with the fact

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,800
that if you do report things

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,399
you don't know if there's any checks and

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,399
balances in place

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,440
and so if you're reporting someone

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,320
higher up

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,320
you're not sure if anything bad will

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,000
happen to you because you're reporting

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,000
someone who has more power than you do

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,959
so looking at the systems in place here

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,839
again it's a power thing

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,680
because the when you're doing the

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,160
reporting and you're unsure of

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,680
how the outcome will come there's an

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,320
equality there

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,600
so we want to be very careful when we

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,320
report these things

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
we sometimes don't report them because

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,120
we know that

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,920
we don't always have the power that

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,920
we're looking for

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,600
so some one solution that i came up with

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,240
is that we need to create

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,639
risk management systems that we can fall

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,480
back on when things go wrong

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,600
even in the realm of sre we know that

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,839
we want to have i steps

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,920
written out for incident reporting

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,880
because when something goes down

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,120
and it's in production people's and

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,959
anxiety is already high

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,199
we don't want to just respond to things

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,760
instantly in that state

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,720
so instead we know that we need to

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,839
manage these

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,279
incidents effectively and to do that we

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,399
need to have

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,079
things listed out to reduce that anxiety

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,959
and make sure that we are responding to

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:34,000
things correctly

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,240
and this moves us on to the post-mortem

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,360
or this part is actually really

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,440
difficult to

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,480
break down and understand in the tech

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
space

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,720
because there's really no postmortem

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,279
when something goes wrong

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,440
and someone leaves the company the most

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,160
i could really think about and can

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,600
did some research about is they do an

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,480
exit interview

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,160
and during an excellent interview the hr

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,560
department will ask you

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,440
why you're leaving if anything bad

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,199
happened

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,880
and that was the cause of you wanting to

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,880
leave the company

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,440
now there's been countless studies that

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,000
showed that most people leave companies

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,079
because of their manager and not so much

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,360
of the actual company

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,920
but hr still asks you these questions

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,279
but especially for marginalized

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,920
individuals

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,360
hr and employees don't have the best

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,279
relationship

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
i was told whenever i go through an

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,279
ex-interview that i

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,920
should not tell the truth because if

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,920
there is a

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,480
at any point i want to come back to the

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,160
company it could be a liability for them

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,279
to hire me again

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,959
so it was never in my best interest to

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,959
tell the truth

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,199
so if this is the only postmortem we

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,199
have is this really effective

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,600
if we look at the systems the bigger

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,160
systems at play

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,839
it's power once again and i want to

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,800
point out the fact that a lot of these

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,360
systems

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,480
are centered around power and the fact

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,839
that

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,040
one group of people are trying to hold

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,519
all the power

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,240
so at every at a number of different

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,320
points

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,440
you see them restricting access and

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,360
opportunity

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,639
and making sure that the policies that

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,480
are putting out there

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:24,959
are benefiting them

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,920
so one solution that i came up with is

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,120
that we can

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,800
create clear policies uh

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,360
i've said this already um in this slides

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,240
and it's honestly one of the easiest

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
ways to make

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,800
change if we have clear policies and

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,600
make sure that there we are reducing

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,320
bias

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,680
in racism and all of those things and

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,920
all of the isms

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,720
when we are making these policies we

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,040
will increase retention rates

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,160
just by making sure that we are doing

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,360
these things

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,720
and making sure that we are taking the

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,160
time to really understand

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,360
why people are leaving and taking that

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,919
pause to reflect

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,360
and find different ways that we can make

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,600
things better and

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,600
increase those retention rates

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,799
the next part that we walk into is the

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,280
testing

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,720
this was another great area for me when

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,280
understanding the tech industry at large

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,039
and how it interacts with these systems

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,360
the one thing that i did think of

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,440
is the performance improvement plans

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,960
these plans are given to employees who

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,039
are falling behind

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
they may not be hitting their mark and

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,400
things like that

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
and the employers are trying to work

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,360
with them to get them back

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:50,640
on track and to keep them as an employee

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,840
but a lot of the times when i looked at

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,720
the people who

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,440
have been on performance improvement

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,200
plans or

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,000
pips there was no real cleared

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,840
path as to what led them to get on these

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,120
pip plans

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,720
and when they got on the plans the goals

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,280
and kpis that they

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,559
had are key performance indicators that

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,960
they had

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,840
weren't that clear either so it seemed

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,000
very vague

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,880
and it didn't seem like it was anything

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,160
that would be

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,559
in the employee's favor instead it just

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,039
seems like another way to prolong

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:32,799
letting someone go

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,840
so if we look at what systemic racism

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,600
looks like

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,880
it's just a reinforcement of all of

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,400
these policies

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,120
and practices that are based on

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
stereotypes and biases and all of these

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,880
different things but

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,679
it's supported by policies and this

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,720
would is

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,760
this is what pip plans look like

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,080
they look like because they're so vague

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,799
they look like just another way to cover

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,919
up

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,200
all the isms and reasoning behind why

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,200
someone is being let go

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,720
so the solution here would be to create

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,520
clear policies and when we create these

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,039
policies

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,320
and making sure that everyone

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,480
understands what is expected of them

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,640
while they are employees and even if

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,160
they do go on a pip plan

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,960
this will have an equitable impact on

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,120
everyone

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,960
it doesn't mean that everyone will keep

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,200
their job or anything like that

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,000
it just means that if you don't miss

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,679
your mark

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
or you don't hit your mark you'll

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,280
understand what mark it is

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,000
why you didn't didn't make it

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,559
and it would be clear as to why you were

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,200
let go

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,200
if you are

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,200
the next part is the compass capacity

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,120
planning

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,039
so this is where we start to scale and

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,520
make things bigger

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,160
a lot of organizations scale really fast

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,400
and

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
things fall apart and they blame it on

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,159
scaling

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,559
if we look at lambda school we'll see

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,880
that example happening there they scaled

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,440
really fast they were probably trying to

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,200
hit their quotas and make sure their

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,679
margins look good and things like that

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,919
so

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,280
they were trying to attract more and

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,039
more students

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,880
but they didn't really pay attention to

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,120
the harm that they were causing by the

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,360
different tactics that they used to

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,760
get those students in a lot of the

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,000
students that they attracted were

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,080
mar from marginalized communities and

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,400
lacked the funding

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,480
that it took to go to land the school so

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,760
they took out these loans that

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,039
were not set up to help anyone but

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,039
the the banks

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,679
so looking at this system it's important

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,080
to understand that

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,720
a lot of these things that are at play

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,159
uh

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,240
has to do with systemic racism and

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,760
one of the key factors in systemic

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,400
racism is ignoring

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,320
the red flags and things that have

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,880
happened in our history

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,880
if you think about it when 2020 and

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,280
everything started to happen

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,200
they a lot of people kept saying i can't

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,400
believe it it's 20 20.

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,159
why is racism still a thing i can think

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,880
back to when obama was president

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,840
became president for the first time and

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,600
he

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,240
a lot of people are saying racism is

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,480
going to end obama is president

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,480
um all the bad times in america are gone

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,000
and or they would say like it was so

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,919
long ago it doesn't matter and that's

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,159
how he became president

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,000
but if you look at any history book you

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,200
don't have to put back that many pages

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,760
to see that

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,039
racism and all of these other isms

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,280
weren't that far back

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,400
and the themes that we are referencing

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,240
didn't happen that

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:55,039
that long ago so what happens

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,880
when when organizations scale and they

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,280
don't take a time to pause

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,080
and go back to the bottom of that pair a

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,400
pyramid

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,360
and start over and make things better

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,000
they're just

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,640
repeating things and just doing it at

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,400
scale

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,400
and causing more and more harm

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,799
so some of the solutions that we can

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,799
have for this one is just

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,200
stop trying to scale when your systems

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,480
don't work if we just take a pause like

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,880
i said and start

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,400
back over at the bottom of that pyramid

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,159
we can make improvements

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,799
and it wouldn't take as long as most

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,360
people would think and when you do scale

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,960
you your margins will be higher because

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,080
you've got it right and you don't have

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,440
to go back

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,440
and fix a lot of mistakes

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,840
now the development part of this

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,120
talk is very frustrating for me

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,200
um if we look at the hiring practices

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,159
in tech we can all agree that they're

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,360
awful

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,159
just a few days ago i read this article

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,080
that was titled people like you don't

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,039
belong in big tech

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,640
it came out from a blog written by aiden

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,880
benjamin

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,880
the title as i was reading the blog i

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,640
realized the title was a response he

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,720
received from an interviewer

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,039
after he shared that he needed

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,799
additional accommodations due to his

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,679
disability

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,720
the interviewer's response was people

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,080
like you

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,159
don't belong in tech

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,240
the only solution that i would ever

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,039
suggest for a situation like this

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,440
is to fire that individual who said that

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,679
because imagine if this person felt so

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,480
confident to say that to someone

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,600
what are they not saying out loud how

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,039
many people

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,919
did that person let go because of some

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,440
ism that they believe in how many people

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,520
did not get that raise that they

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,520
deserved that promotion because

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,960
that person wanted to hold on to their

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,279
power

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,919
it's themes and people like this who are

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,640
in power and can create the policies

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,440
that continue to build and support these

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,400
systems that we are trying to work

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,400
and get away from

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,440
there is no doubt in my mind that the

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,640
example that i'm showing

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:19,039
here for the develop development section

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,279
is intuition of intuitional racism

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,240
because and i say this even though it's

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,320
related to

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:29,600
ableism what we're seeing in

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,799
uh when people are playing out

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,480
and um having these tendencies and

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,440
patterns that

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,880
promote ableism is directly related to

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,000
racism

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,200
you can't have one without the other

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,400
racism and ableism is just a tool to

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,600
put barriers on people so by

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,480
eradicating one by eradicating

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,360
racism we're that much much closer to

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,360
eradicating

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,799
ableism so

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,640
now we've gone through this pyramid and

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,960
if we don't do it right

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,320
we will get to the production stage and

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,679
we'll build things

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,480
like the facial recognition

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,600
that doesn't pick up darker skin tones

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,000
or different gender expressions

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,360
and all of the facial recognitions that

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,400
doesn't work

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,360
it's usually built off of data and

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,159
the machine learning is using data that

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,559
isn't

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,039
clean like it isn't good data it's full

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,080
of bias it's full of racism

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,400
ableism all the isms but

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,360
it got to the production stage and it's

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,720
out there and it's causing harm

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,960
another example of um

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,000
tech that gets to the production stage

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,120
that

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,480
has all the bad things baked into it

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,120
is the face but facebook ad algorithm

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,240
this is something i recently had to

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,520
interact with

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,440
i was doing a mental health event for

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,960
tech by choice and it was focused on our

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,200
black members

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,720
and so i was trying to run an ad that

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,360
had black community

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,000
and self-preservation the ad was

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,159
rejected

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,679
multiple times because it was flagged as

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,960
a social justice

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:22,320
issue black mental health

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,320
is a social justice issue

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,320
when facebook looks at it

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,520
we see that power again is at play

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,400
with some of the issues that we see when

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,200
bad code gets to production or bra bad

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,480
algorithms are out there

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,279
but i want to make a key

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,640
uh point here that the power that i'm

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,279
talking about here

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,720
it's not so much um someone's trying to

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,279
hold things back

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,880
but instead people are holding back

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,360
individuals from being

00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,320
in positions of power to make a change

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,320
and to make a difference

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,360
so the solution that i came up for this

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,799
issue is to go ahead and

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,720
make sure that we're creating

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,279
environments that will allow more people

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,480
to

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,159
enter the space and have positions of

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,960
power where they can create

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,640
policies and change and but we want to

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,200
make sure that they feel empowered

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,880
enough

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,880
to challenge the status quo

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:30,559
so through these stats we can see that

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:35,360
tech is really just a microcosm of the

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:38,320
world the larger world that we live in

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,559
but the good thing about that is we can

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,240
change it for the better

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,039
and tech how many people do you know

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,120
that takes takes home

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,960
tech with them there are a number of

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,399
people i know that use a

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,039
agile methodology to plan out grocery

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,240
shopping

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,880
and events that they have for fun

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,799
we can use this logical thinking to be

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,720
able to identify the thoughtless

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,279
tendencies and behaviors

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,520
that tend to come up from these systems

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,760
that were designed to make sure

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,760
certain groups do not succeed

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,880
and i know i said a lot of negative

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,720
things about tech

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,120
but i do want to point out the fact that

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,039
tech is starting to change

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,279
it's just slow af

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,279
and when i think about this i think it's

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,200
very odd that as a community

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,399
and as an industry we can build these

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,440
amazing products

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:39,360
that can scale very quickly but

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,520
we can't get human interaction right

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,679
it's something to think about and it's

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,960
something that we can change

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:50,000
how fast and how effective the changes

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,000
all depends on us

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,919
so i've come to the end of my talk and i

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,080
just want to say thank you

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,360
for listening to me talk about these

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,760
systems and

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,600
finding different ways that we can

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,600
pinpoint the different behaviors and

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,960
tendencies so we can make the change we

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,520
want to see

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,279
just a quick shout out tech by choice is

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,600
trying to change the system

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,880
for minority owned businesses by running

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,600
a hackathon

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,039
to help take these business owners into

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,080
the digital space and make sure that

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,679
they thrive

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,440
if you want to be a part of this change

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,279
go ahead and check out our events

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:30,480
website and see how you can get involved

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,480
and that's it

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,159
all right thank you so much valerie that

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,880
was great i

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,480
loved all of the stuff you had and

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,080
there's so many helpful slides

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,080
uh one of the things i find almost

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,640
ironic is tech

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,480
is almost always this like move fast

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,360
break things sort of mentality

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,080
and yet uh you know you just mentioned

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,600
tech

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,840
in terms of at least these kinds of

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,120
systems is just slow

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,520
incredibly slow and it's incredibly

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,399
ironic i think just in general

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,799
um how somebody had wondered how do we

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,120
keep

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,799
feedback from becoming entangled with

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,159
performance focused activities like

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,159
reviews or okrs

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,840
um can you repeat the question

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,360
yeah i think i'm a little bittery even

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,120
though it's like i'm talking to my

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,840
computer

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,720
that's fine um how do we keep feedback

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,880
from becoming

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,080
entangled in performance-focused

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,799
activities

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,440
like um you know reviews from managers

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,880
or

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,960
um okrs or other things like that

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,360
um yeah i think if we i think

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,559
organizations that only hold feedback

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,960
for reviews

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,679
are not good good organizations like you

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,760
need to have

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,399
constant feedback to get the better

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,000
reviews and to improve like your skill

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,600
set and things like that

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,679
so i think if

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,519
if the system was set up that way so

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,960
it's just constant feedback constant

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,240
communication about what's working

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,919
what's not working

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,240
there wouldn't be any room to tie it to

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,080
uh

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,799
kpis um and i think there are different

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,960
ways that we can talk about improvements

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,480
and not tie it to metrics

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,960
um and i think that's one of the

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,880
trickier parts

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,120
just in tech in general we don't do a

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,480
good job at tracking

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,679
non like code related tasks

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,600
i don't think we do a good job at that

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,440
it's also interesting because we're so

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,880
much into collecting all this data but

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,880
yeah we almost don't have data

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:43,279
on our own practices like this

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,480
um somebody had wondered if you had any

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,279
thoughts on how to scale

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,440
down systems that don't work um and how

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,799
to insist on

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,200
perpetuating and lifting people up

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,960
yeah i've noticed that in most

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,720
organizations there's one

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,120
little part of a org that gets it right

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,960
and something that i was recently told

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,320
is that when you do have a part of your

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,000
art that's getting it right

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,399
what you want to do is slowly add

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,799
individuals from other groups that are

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,440
getting it wrong add them to the good

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,679
team

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,519
let them get used to those practices and

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,000
the way things work there

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,039
and then they will instinctively take

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,760
that back to

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,240
any um group or any team that they work

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,840
with

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,519
so if we can do that um it takes time

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,320
that i don't think you can speed that

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,840
one up uh so it is going to be slow

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,399
as af wait don't say bad words

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,640
um so that's fine but that's something

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,640
that we would want to do at a slower

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
pace

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,000
