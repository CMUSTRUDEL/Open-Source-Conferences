whose purpose in life is to serve as a

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,720
warning to others when not writing

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,399
integration code in a language that no

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,120
one has ever heard of speaking at

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,200
meme

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,200
is me in fish form i have a kind of

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,959
aggressive a little intimidating

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,360
personality i'm very type a

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,360
i'm very kind of high strung um

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,279
okay i'm very kind of high strung and

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,720
that issue of my personality is kind of

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,720
going to be brought to the forefront

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,000
in this story um the other thing you

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,040
need to realize about me

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,480
i am divorced um don't be sorry for me

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,160
it was a good thing

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,320
and as a consequence of the divorce i

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,560
ended up moving back in with my parents

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,320
um i was having a hard time finding

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,880
employment i was working at a minimum

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,800
wage

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,560
part-time jobs struggling to make ends

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,639
meet whole thing

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,720
and i had to switch careers and move

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,480
into the text here very very quickly

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,839
in order to do that i went to a

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,720
programming boot camp

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,480
and i mean the good news is that it came

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,079
pretty naturally to me

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,760
but the bad news was i looked around and

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,920
i was like well

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,839
i'm competing with these 20 other people

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,240
who are in this bootcamp for jobs and

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,880
all of

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,639
us we're competing with people out there

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,920
who have computer science degrees we're

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,120
competing with people who have

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,399
experience

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,399
so i busted my butt

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,079
to get through boot camp i did extra

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,320
work i did side projects i started

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,920
networking i started going to meetups

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,360
i had interviews lined up before the

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,880
program ended i mean i

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,240
i worked and as an end result of that

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,079
work

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,240
i did almost immediately out of the boot

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,160
camp land a job at highland software

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,680
which is one of northeast ohio's biggest

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,240
and most well-known tech companies

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,800
so it worked out for me but i'm about to

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,920
share

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,360
the cost involved in having that work

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,279
out so well for me

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,680
i've become kind of good friends with

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,519
the woman who ran the boot camp

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,199
and as i was in it was a brand new

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,800
program um

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,480
i was in kind of her first professional

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,079
cohort she called me up and she said you

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,839
know i have the news here

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,440
and they want to interview someone who

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,320
went to the program would you come in

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,519
and talk to them

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,040
so i said yeah sure why not

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,040
and i ended up on the news

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,600
so i was on the tv and i was kind of in

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,519
this news article

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,440
and i had a really good response i

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,480
started going to some meetings um

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,800
with the boot camp i was kind of their

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,199
recruitment person they had me you know

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,839
tried it out as a success story a lot

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,040
and then they wanted to do a commercial

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,480
and

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,480
when they got me to do the commercial i

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,760
mean they can't even say tori you're a

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,600
rock star

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,000
and i was like no i hate the word

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,199
rockstar that is an omen that is a bad

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,560
omen

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,240
like no no and this commercial keeps me

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,160
up at night it haunts my dreams because

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,279
i literally say the word rockstar in the

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,920
commercial

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,760
they asked me to and i still think about

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,600
it and i don't like it and you can find

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,000
this on youtube but please don't because

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,120
it is

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,320
tremendously embarrassing um but since i

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,920
was already i was getting involved in

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,360
tech community through the boot camp and

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,079
i was working at highland

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,519
highland is really um into tech outreach

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,440
and community outreach and so they

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,399
started asking me to do things

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,079
and this is the slide at which i mean i

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,440
need to skip over this because i was

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,320
losing

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,000
so much time to paying attention to the

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,680
slide and trying to tell you all how

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,800
busy i was

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,959
when i started my career um all you need

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,040
to know really is that 2018

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,560
was a terrible year because i was

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,639
overbooked i was double booked for

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,959
things i could not say no to things

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,560
i would go to work and just i would work

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,079
and do things outside of work and stay

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,040
at work and go back to work and it was

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,040
just

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,120
so much work and it wasn't even my day

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,880
job it was everything surrounding my day

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,680
job and i had to be

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,320
you know i had a romantic partner i had

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,000
a kid

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,440
i had pets like i'm doing all this on

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,959
top of my life

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,560
and it was just it was it was a lot

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,720
it was so much but i didn't feel like

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,399
it was burning me out because i was just

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,639
stressed right

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,160
like just because i'm doing a whole lot

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,160
of things it doesn't mean that i'm

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,399
suffering from bird out i'm just really

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,440
busy

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,600
we saw yesterday in the first talk that

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,600
the world health organization says that

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,279
burnout is workplace stress that has not

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,880
been successfully managed

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,800
well i didn't i didn't have workplace

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,720
stress my day job was fine

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,519
i would go into the office sit down

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,079
program the computer and my day job was

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,480
great it was all the things i was doing

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,640
in addition to my day job

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,839
that was causing me so much stress and

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,360
anxiety and

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,360
causing me to feel bad which is why

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,199
i really like this quote that i found

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,120
from elena marini

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,880
who defined burnout as a combination of

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,039
the nature of your work environment and

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,799
what it demands of you

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,240
but also your relationship to your work

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,919
and what happened with me is that my

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,120
relationship to my work was no longer

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,160
healthy because i had

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,600
made so much more work for myself i

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,559
convinced myself that in order to be

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
successful

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,240
i not only had to do my day job but i

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,520
had to do all these other things on top

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
of it and keep putting myself

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,480
out there and keep just going and going

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
and going and always saying yes because

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,280
that was how i was going to be

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,960
a success

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
and at that point you begin to ask

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,440
yourself well am i really just

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,320
stressing because i have a lot going on

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,360
or

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,200
am i burning out and at that point i

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
kept telling myself that i was just a

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,480
little stressed

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,640
but the truth was that i felt like

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,000
absolute garbage

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,000
all the time because being in

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,280
this constant state of stress and

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,880
anxiety and go

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,480
go go makes us physically ill

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,400
i would wake up in the morning to go to

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,760
work and it was

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,679
it was so hard to drink myself out of

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,280
bed and to go to the office because

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,880
i was so certain that it was going to be

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,280
another bad day

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,799
when you're burnt out it's every day is

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,480
a bad day you don't have the motivation

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,640
to try and make it a good day anymore

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,200
you just you don't have the energy

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,480
you go to work and you procrastinate you

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,679
put things off because you don't want to

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,520
do them and then you have to do

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,120
everything all at once because you left

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,799
it very last minute

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,400
and then there's some small uptick in

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,000
success in getting it done

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,520
but it's not done right and it's not

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,559
done well because you don't

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,240
care anymore and after

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,760
it keeps going on and going on and going

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,679
on you're so busy

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,760
i suffer from migraines and my migraines

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,799
went to chronic migraine i

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,600
always had some sort of event just

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,559
threatening right around here to happen

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,840
um

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:11,120
i horn a fitbit since 2016.

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,360
so i have i have the data on this and

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,280
my cardiovascular health tanked i mean

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,600
we learned in yesterday's talk about its

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,840
effects on your blood pressure

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,840
and your heart rate and by the time that

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,960
i finally got help for all this my

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,919
resting heart rate averaged at 90

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,679
which for my size and my age is

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,280
extremely high

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,120
any sort of physical activity i did we

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,000
just said in my full skyrocketing until

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,559
i felt like i was going to pass out

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,240
and you know i'm thinking about this and

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,880
i'm wondering

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,160
why was i doing this to myself like what

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,720
was the pursuit

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,520
of work and work and more work

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,919
um you know what i kept saying yes even

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,919
though i knew that

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,919
it wasn't good for me anymore

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,280
these are some photos i want to share

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,679
with you guys um

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,360
it's fun little game called the selfie

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,000
that i send to my girlfriends in the

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,240
group chat

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,120
when i'm feeling like trash and the

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,679
photo that i post on social media

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,799
so this one is from 2018 it's from one

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,280
of the highland women in tech

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,039
conferences that i was organizing

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,480
um the bathroom selfie is obviously

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,520
right before i went out and started the

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,039
conference

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,880
and you can be forgiven for thinking

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,799
that the other selfie

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,720
with the tremendous bags under my eyes

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,320
is after i got home and i was tired from

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,720
running a conference

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,679
and instead it's the other way around

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,799
that sophie

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,400
is me being like i'm gonna run late

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,240
because i need to put on 20 pounds of

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,640
makeup in order to hide what's going on

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
right here

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,760
here's another one the caption on this

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,000
one was i haven't slept for two days lol

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,280
meanwhile compare contrast with the

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,240
president of my high school

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,679
giving me a young alumni award for you

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,600
know

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,760
all the things i do to promote women in

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,440
tech because i'm so busy that i'm

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,039
batting on the inside

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,880
which i feel kind of comes across a

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,880
little on my face there but hopefully no

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,240
one else could tell

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,520
the most telling one though this is me

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,880
on my way home from a speaking

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,440
engagement

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,880
versus the selfie i sent to my friend

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,880
asking her

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,360
to bring the box of kleenex from her

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,039
desk to the highland ladies room

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,960
because i had to stress cry in the

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,480
bathroom and i'd run out of toilet paper

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,360
but someone else was in there so i

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,840
didn't want to leave the stall

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,159
like if you are stressed crying at work

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,320
you probably have a problem

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,159
like it's you shouldn't be stressed

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,440
crying at work i mean i think we've all

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,480
cried at work at least once but it

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,720
shouldn't be an ongoing occurrence

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,919
and this this kept going and i kept

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,559
putting work on myself

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,760
this is from codemash in 2019 so this is

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,880
this is january

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,000
of 2019. and so at this point i've been

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,840
running myself ragged

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,320
for over a year and

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,960
you can tell if you look at the bathroom

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,400
hotel

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,480
selfie the end of my ponytail looks kind

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,039
of gross my hair is a little scraggly

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,640
if you look up where my heart is it's a

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,760
little thin

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,320
and that's because the fatigue

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,440
and the health effects of the burnout

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,559
and everything we're getting to the

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,799
point where my hair was falling out

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,640
if you look at my social media selfie i

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,480
have a lot of product in my hair

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,240
i'm making a weird face so you can't

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,080
tell how tired i am

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,760
and my hair is very carefully parted in

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,880
a way that hides

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,919
where my actual like natural part is

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,480
because my hair situation was getting

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,120
kind of

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,120
kind of iffy

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
finally in april i ended up with the

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,880
doctor

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,120
um this is actually from my birthday my

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,080
33rd birthday present to myself was a

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,960
trip to the doctor

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,720
to explain that i couldn't keep doing

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,320
what i was doing and i needed to know if

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,080
there was something

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,600
actually physically wrong with me um

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,679
and i was expecting just you know a

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,120
brief examination and for her to tell me

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,200
that i needed

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,440
to maybe cut some things out of my

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,280
schedule and meditate a little and drink

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,000
water and i would be fine

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,120
and instead she ordered seven different

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,919
blood tests

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,440
did a physical and told me that we

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,280
needed to find what was causing my

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,720
health issues because it couldn't keep

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,080
going this way

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,880
which was a wake-up call i mean we did

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,840
find out

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,520
that i had a low-grade non-anemic iron

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,760
deficiency that would help

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,280
explain some of the symptoms it was

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,919
probably why i was so

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,000
so tired and i looked so tired i

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,400
probably had a lot to do with my hair

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,679
but aside from those health effects it

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,760
wouldn't explain

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,600
the total package and i definitely did

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,919
need to stop running myself ragged all

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,919
the time

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,159
so i had to ask myself why am i doing

00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,440
this because it's not just about money

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,559
anymore it's not about

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,559
furthering my career at this point it

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,360
may have started that way

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,200
but that's not what it was at all

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,200
because as soon as i stopped moving as

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,400
soon as i tried to relax i would

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,159
become so keyed up i get so much anxiety

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,360
and feel like i wasn't being productive

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,840
and i wasn't working

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,080
and i needed to be doing more and i

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,440
needed to be starting things and

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,799
you know people would miss me if i

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,000
disappeared and what if i don't get

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,039
enough likes on twitter

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,960
and i learned that

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,520
your brain actually can become

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,279
addicted to productivity in the same way

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,880
that it can be addicted to alcohol it

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,600
can be addictive substances it can be

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,880
addicted to

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,640
other kind of destructive behaviors

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:50,400
the front part of our brain changes

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,600
physically we rewire ourselves to be

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,120
in pursuit of this of the high of this

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,520
this feeling

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,400
that we get and that's that front part

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,640
of our brain

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,080
right up here that's where our executive

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,720
functioning lives so in the same way

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,480
that

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,960
someone with adhd for example their

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,640
executive function is

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,039
influenced in a way that you know it

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,360
causes problems with attention and focus

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,000
and impulsive behavior

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,480
when you have a problem with addiction

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,520
your

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,080
executive function is so tuned in to

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,240
pursuing that reward

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,360
that you let the rest of your life just

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,880
fall apart

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,440
the only thing that matters is

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,960
satisfying the reward system you're

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,480
bringing which is so fine-tuned to this

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,919
one thing

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,080
so this is your content warning part

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,440
like if you need to drop off

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,440
i understand um

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,880
so for me that feeling of anxiety that i

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,200
would get when i felt like

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,039
i would try to relax but it would feel

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,440
bad and i would get

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,840
so nervous and i just i didn't know what

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,640
to do with myself

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,480
was very reminiscent of the feeling that

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,559
i would get

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,799
about 10 years ago when my pill bottle

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,279
was empty

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,120
so i have not touched a benzodiazepine

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,000
in over 10 years

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,000
like i'm good with that i am what the

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,880
cool kids now follow in remission which

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,600
is when you have been

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,880
in active recovery from your addiction

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,080
for over five years

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,320
but for me the word recovery is an

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,840
ongoing process it's something that

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,520
promises us that we're going to get

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,480
better it's something that i think about

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,799
often

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,159
maybe not every day anymore but i

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,840
consider it to be

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,320
something that i'm always putting into

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,000
practice and so if we can recover from

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,320
other forms of addiction and if we can

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
recover from mental health issues

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,360
at least to a certain extent we can

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,520
recover

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,120
from burning ourselves out and becoming

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,799
addicted to work in this idea that we

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,919
need to be productive and we need to be

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,960
successful

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,000
the question is how do we do that or at

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,919
least

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,039
how did i do that and if you're

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,799
suffering for kind of

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,600
the same kind of things maybe some of

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,600
these can help you

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,360
it's a pop culture reference by now that

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,039
step one is admitting you have a problem

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,679
which obviously with my trip to the

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,799
doctor i realized that something hadn't

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,400
changed

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,000
even if you've never been in a 12-step

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,600
program you've never read a big book in

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,960
your life you're probably familiar with

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,480
that saying

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,320
and now that i've identified the root

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,279
cause of my problem

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,120
that i had to keep working because i'd

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,120
rewired my brain that way

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,960
it was time to take some steps to undo

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,799
the damage

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,720
the first thing was i had to tackle all

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,880
the things i'd let go in my lifestyle

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,559
that enabled me to just keep saying

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,799
yes to things and over booking my

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,840
calendar i mean after all

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,120
it's you know in order to recover from

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,080
my benson addiction

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,480
i had to stop taking benzos it's like

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,399
you know

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,760
you can't keep doing the same lifestyle

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,240
things you can follow

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,480
all the slides that come after this but

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,200
if you don't change your lifestyle

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,039
nothing else changes what i had to learn

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,960
is how to manage expectations around my

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,840
time both my expectations and other

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,679
people's

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,559
expectations and i learned

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,520
five magic words to doing that and they

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,360
are let me

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:14,320
check my schedule it's not a yes

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,840
it's not a no it's when someone asks you

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,200
to do something let me check my schedule

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,520
and it gives you that little break to be

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,320
like do i really want to do this

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,799
can i can i book this i can i can look

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,799
this up

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,880
and actually see if i'm overbooked and

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,080
then i can make a decision

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,919
and i thought that people don't really

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,679
push back once you say no he's like oh

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,279
no i'm sorry i'm so busy i'd love to

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,679
help you but i can't

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,960
i haven't had someone push back on that

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,240
so it's a good way to say

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,039
no without being like hard no and along

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,880
with that

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,720
it's let me cut down my schedule things

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,919
that i actually really want to do and

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,520
things that i'm actually really

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,880
passionate about

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,559
the other thing that i learned is that i

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,679
need to delegate my responsibilities

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,320
better

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,159
if i'm in an event like i'll fill a

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,159
leadership vacuum all day long but i

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,000
can't micromanage i can't be responsible

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,000
for everything

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,039
i need to trust other people to do

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,320
things for me

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,960
even though it was like writing this

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,440
talk i've sent my partner out to get

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,159
dinner

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,559
because i can't sit down write a talk

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,600
and

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,840
cook dinner and it's just those small

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,679
small steps small things that you can do

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,799
to just free up your schedule and learn

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,799
to let go a little bit

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,720
the other thing that i had to take care

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,360
of was my physical health which

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,240
as evidenced by my trip to the doctor

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,440
suffered

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,880
a lot the first thing

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,840
was i bought this water bottle i was

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
drinking

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,360
literally pots of coffee a day in an

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,159
effort to both

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,840
stay awake and be interesting and

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,919
because i just really like coffee and i

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,480
let it get totally out of hand

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,000
um i hate drinking water but i make sure

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,200
that i fill this up at least once a day

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,480
and drink the entire thing

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,240
i realize that you're supposed to drink

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,760
like two of these but i really really

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,520
hate water

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,559
and honestly even though the half amount

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,919
of water

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,320
big difference in health um the other

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,880
thing

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,039
for me was my sleep hygiene again with

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,399
the fitbit if you have a fitbit with a

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,240
heart rate monitor in it

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,840
it will actually track how you sleep and

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,120
give you the sleep score

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,279
my sleep score was abysmal i've raised

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,840
it about 30 points

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,960
since beginning my my whole wellness

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,880
makeover

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,240
and even just taking my electronics and

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,279
taking my work things

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,200
out of the bedroom not working until i

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,679
absolutely had to fall asleep

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,120
not you know just pushing myself and

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,399
pushing myself and then expecting myself

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,799
to fall asleep

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,480
immediately getting some nice pajamas

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,320
getting some nice pillows taking a

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,679
little work break before i try going to

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,440
bed these are

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,840
tiny things that make a really big

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,640
difference because giving your body that

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,360
chance to

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,799
rest and reset is so vitally important

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,640
and this is from someone

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,640
who i mean years and years ago also had

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,120
insomnia problems

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,960
like i love sleep i just i don't know

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,760
what i'm going to do if i have insomnia

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,840
again because it's

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,360
it's i love sleep sleep is my new

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,720
favorite thing it's like i've just

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,159
discovered it it's i'm

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,399
completely in love um

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,000
i have the obligatory endorphins make

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,240
you happy on here

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,440
um getting a workout is always good for

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,360
you getting your heart rate up a little

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,720
even your fingers taking a short walk

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,640
but i'm trying to stay away from things

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,480
that like you can google and google can

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,480
tell them to do better than i can

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,120
i do want to talk about releasing

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,120
pressure and releasing anxiety and

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,360
dealing with it in a healthy way

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,880
um that frustration and that that

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,399
feeling that i had when i was so keyed

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,880
up and i didn't feel like i was being

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,200
productive that i needed to do something

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,120
um those feelings when we're when we're

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,159
trying to change our lives and when

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,320
we're trying to come

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,559
back from something that's very

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,240
negatively affected our health

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,240
we can have a lot of anger we can have a

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,279
lot of frustration in dealing with that

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,440
we need to

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,880
release those feelings in ways that are

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,960
not harmful to others and they're not

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,799
humble to ourselves

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,799
um when you're suffering from something

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,519
like burnout it's really easy to start

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,399
self-medicating it's really easy to go

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,919
and start

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,519
you know having a glass of wine every

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,919
night that turns into two that turns

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,320
into

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,159
three that turns into a bottle it's

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,320
really easy to have

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,559
it's easy to have another problem in

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,399
addition to your burnout

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,159
so it's very important to find a way to

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,960
release those feelings in ways that

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,440
aren't harmful

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,880
especially things like anger because i

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,120
know i had a lot of

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,679
anger towards myself and it's this

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,760
feeling of i mean almost shame

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,279
that you let things get so bad and you

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,200
should have known better and you kind of

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,960
turned that inward

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,559
the best advice and this is going to

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,279
sound so stupid but i love showing at

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,039
people

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,120
i once had a therapist tell me go out

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,880
and buy a newspaper

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,799
and the whole point of the newspaper was

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,960
that next time i was just absolutely

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,480
furious at myself and i just wanted to

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,720
punch something or just

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,279
you know to take it out somehow i would

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,880
get the newspaper and just rip it shreds

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,200
and let me tell you when you are

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,399
absolutely just so angry at the world

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,480
taking it out on

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,799
this shreddable paper is really

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,320
satisfying it sounds silly

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,760
but it's absolutely true um the other

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,360
things i wanted to talk about i want to

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,720
talk about journaling

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,960
because everyone tells you to hit the

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,519
gym i'm bad at

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,080
journaling i know that it's good for me

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:28,000
and it's a mindfulness practice but

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,840
i am so bad at keeping up a journal

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,919
i will write about my feelings for like

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,159
three days max and then forget the thing

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,240
exists

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,000
i tricked myself into journaling by

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,720
writing down what i have for dinner

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,159
every night because i am very highly

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,880
food motivated

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,480
i love food so if i write down what i

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,159
have for dinner every night because i

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,919
won't skip dinner so i won't skip

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,440
writing down what i had for dinner

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,960
i find i'm already journaling i'm

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,080
already writing i'm already writing down

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,679
my dinner

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,360
so i might as well write down how i'm

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,159
feeling and then i start thinking about

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,080
it and then

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,919
congratulations now i'm journaling for

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:09,200
real instead of just writing venue plans

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,200
two more slides

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,599
this this was also one of my big ones

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,280
and it was doing things that are

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,359
the opposite of work

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,200
um dedicated time in my schedule

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,720
scheduling blocks of non-productive

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,440
activity and i have to define

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,520
non-productive activity these are things

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,679
that do not produce a product

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,879
like there's no end the thing that you

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,800
end up with

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,159
and they do not help you accomplish any

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,240
sort of goal

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,399
this is just mindless this is sitting on

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,399
the couch binging netflix

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,879
and not binging a documentary you're not

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,720
learning this is brain candy time

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,800
this is on your phone playing candy

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,480
crush until you use until your phone

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,000
just dies because you've lost track of

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,200
time time

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,960
um things like going and taking a walk

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,720
but a slow aimless walk

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,560
i define this as the difference between

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,359
me i'm a hiker

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,079
so i walking is my hobby it's the

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,400
difference between

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,359
me taking an ambling walk through my

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,680
neighborhood

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,599
and me strapping on a pack driving to

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,320
the park and hiking for 10 miles

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,000
one of those has a goal the other one is

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,480
non-productive time

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,040
and at first this was tremendously hard

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,680
this was i had to force myself

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,560
to turn off and do something that didn't

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,079
matter but i

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,079
it gets easier the more you do it

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,520
last slide well there's three more signs

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,400
but this is really the last important

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,960
slide

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,400
um i don't have a social support again

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,000
these are things that you can google and

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,640
google can tell you them better than i

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
can

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,240
but i do want to talk about employee

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,640
assistance programs

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,560
they are usually offered they're offered

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,440
by a lot of employers and they can not

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,520
only provide

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,200
mental health and counseling services

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,960
often for free

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,800
a lot of them i've seen employees get

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,400
you know x number of therapy visits on

00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,920
the employee assistance programs that

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,520
they don't have to pay for

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,359
but if you're having any sort of other

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,079
stroke in your life they can provide

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,760
often legal assistance um financial

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,359
advice things like that so just

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,200
your employer is already paying for it

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,000
if it's an offering to you please take

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,119
advantage of it

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,440
in general also

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,440
therapy i love therapy i am currently a

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,040
therapy graduate but would go back in a

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,040
heartbeat i think everyone should have a

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,400
therapist before they need one just in

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,480
case

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,079
having a professional to talk things out

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,800
with and how to process your feelings

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,800
with and

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,280
check in with and it's vitally important

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,119
in any sort of recovery

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:40,240
process and then just getting out of

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,240
the office one of my problems working at

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,680
highland was that you know i'd

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,440
come fresh out of the course all my

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,440
friends are my ex's friends so i made

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,720
new friends and i made them at work

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,160
and these people are still my friends

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,839
even though i don't work at highland

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,280
they're amazing

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,200
but we'd be like oh yeah we should hang

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,720
out after work and

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,119
hanging out after work was booking a

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,800
conference room at work after work

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,880
which didn't help with my work-life

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,240
balance that didn't exist because

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,680
also all of my friends were work so

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,839
even if you can get out on your lunch

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,400
break take a walk you can just go out to

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,359
the parking lot of your job and if you

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,880
work from home

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,400
leave your house go out in your driveway

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,079
go in your backyard do something that

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,599
gets you away from your work environment

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,200
for at least a little bit

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,000
every single day so helpful

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,680
but i am out of time and because i'm out

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,680
of time i want to leave you with two

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,280
things i want to leave you with

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,119
i am doing much better i am

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,880

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,880

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,920

so thank you for both of those um

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,640
somebody had asked us in our artifacts

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,480
live channel

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,640
do you have any advice for figuring out

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,960
which responsibilities can or should be

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,040
delegated when you're a team of one

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,400
oh when you're attainable that's that's

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,960
hard when you're having a moment

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,320
is there if there's any help of becoming

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,240
a team of two

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,320
i would do that but i understand that's

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,520
not always possible

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,800
um for me i've been lucky to have other

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,000
support

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,720
um i don't know for a team of one i

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
would just say

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,079
is there something in your personal life

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,480
that you can delegate out

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,119
even you know i had the ability to send

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,520
my partner

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,880
out for meals can you do something like

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,880
a meal planning

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,400
service or a subscription service or

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,079
something that will deliver that to your

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,040
door instead of having to go grocery

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,280
shopping

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,040
um can you find any way to kind of

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,240
automate and make your life

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,079
easier with really anything and delegate

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,119
that out to a service

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,119
dry cleaning pickup

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,720
yeah those are some good thoughts

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,000
uh i i was also thinking about how with

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,839
a lot of remote jobs

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,839
you know people especially if they've

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,280
been working in person

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,119
for their job there's probably this

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,440
higher stress level that people

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,359
have this need to feel productive or

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,880
work a lot or at odder hours

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,800
you have suggestions on how they could

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,560
try and reduce their stress when maybe

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,560
the team or management kind of expects

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,079
them to be this rock star at home

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,440
so fun story with uh harley davidson

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,800
dealer systems right now

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,000
we are all working overtime uh because

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,280
we are beholden to the motor

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,920
company and the motor company's

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,800
deadlines did not get moved when we lost

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,599
some staff

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,560
and long story short everyone is working

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,240
a lot

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,000
from home because we don't have an

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,280
office anymore

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,960
and ever again so everyone at my job has

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,800
been adjusting to that

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,640
exact situation um for me

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,480
my work-life balance is obviously it's

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,359
really important to me now i've changed

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,240
jobs twice

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,119
in pursuit of a better balance and i'm

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,079
really protective of my time at home

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,040
so this in this entire area that you

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,680
have seen

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,359
around me is brand new it's been built

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,400
once i found out that i wouldn't have an

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,920
office ever again

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,800
at harley-davidson um

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,359
at lunchtime i may next i may not get to

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,119
take my full lunch time

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,560
but there's going to be at least 20

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,040
minutes where i am

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,640
i am off do not send me teams messages

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,440
because i will not get them i am not in

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,839
this room

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,280
i am elsewhere in my house i am taking a

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,599
walk outside i am

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,359
gone if it is really important i have

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,800
teams on my phone and you can tag me but

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,079
if you tell me when it's not important

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,440
i'll be mad it's okay to be mad at your

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,240
teammates

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,000
um other than that scheduling is a big

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,960
one making sure that we have

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,040
enough devs on at one time to pair and

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,640
do work and knock things out

00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,319
and then if all else fails

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,839
push back to your management your

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,960
manager probably cares about you more

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,280
than you think

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,560
um the dev team that harley davidson has

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,640
been really

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,240
really fortunate to have a manager that

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,800
will push back to the product team

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,240
when they enact a kind of unreasonable

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,240
deadline on us

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,359
and the politicians call me because i'll

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,280
yell for you

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,599
like my team has learned that i don't

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,200
have a filter on this

00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,599
and so some of the product teams have

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,280
gotten have gotten like full tory why is

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,079
this our problem because we didn't set

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,079
these deadlines

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,240
it's about boundaries and sometimes you

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,599
have to enforce them using your voice

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,319
very loudly and forcefully over teens

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,160
yeah um you'd also mention taking your

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,319
vacation days which i

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,079
i guess hypocritically agree with you

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,880
because i know right now i've started a

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,040
new job

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,720
and i'm probably probably could use a

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,160
little vacation but feeling guilty about

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,240
trying to take it

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,920
any ideas on how to ensure people do

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,359
things like this or cutting your clutter

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,480
or some of the other things you

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,960
suggested

00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,040
i am i'm also a vacation day hypocrite i

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,800
will afford my vacation days

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,079
um i have to force myself to actually

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,760
use them

00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,960
um part of my problem is that i always

00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,839
want to take off like the end of the

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,319
year like that

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,440
weird christmas new year's time like i

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,200
always want to take that off and then

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,079
i'm like i can't use them anywhere else

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,920
because i want that

00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,760
i'm like i get i get three weeks and

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,760
that's like a week max so tori what are

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,240
you doing you need to like

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,839
go somewhere and at the height of my

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,359
burnout i actually had a friend who was

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,000
like uh you need a vacation and i was

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,000
like

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,640
patrick i don't take vacations i don't

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,160
i just i gave him the school i don't

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,440
take vacations because i can't because i

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,520
really need to

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,920
and he told me that wasn't good for me

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,880
and i told him

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,839
um but it's find something that you want

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,240
to do

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,000
so when you think about what kind of

00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,760
downtime is important to you like for me

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,400
it's getting outside and i know that

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,480
i can get outside in the winter i don't

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,760
mind winter camping but other people do

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,520
and so if i want to go out with my

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,560
friends and we want to go camping

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,760
i need to take a vacation

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,599
during the summer and i will

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,520
contact people we will schedule that in

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,359
advance and it will get on the schedule

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,800
as soon as possible and i will tell my

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:09,040
manager and that i can't change it

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,880
so it's getting it on the schedule it's

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,280
kind of identifying what is important to

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,720
you to do outside of work

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,520
and scheduling that it's not don't take

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,359
a vacation

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,880
and just like stay at home and watch tv

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,640
i know i talked about non-productive

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,720
activity

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,000
but use a vacation to motivate you to do

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,200
something else that you care about to

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,079
get away to travel

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,240
to do something fun and don't think

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,280
about work for a while

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,560
yeah you had also suggested hobbies or

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,160
non-productive time

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,680
as important things to make sure you

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,960
schedule for um

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,160
do you have suggestions on one either

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,359
how to pick up

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,960
a hobby or more reliably pick one up if

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,400
you maybe already have it you're just

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,040
not doing it lately

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,720
or other suggestions on like if you

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,560
cleared space out of your calendar

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,720
not filling it back up again with things

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,359
that don't matter so much

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,079
so when i say like a non-productive

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,520
hobby

00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,000
i have a whole i have a whole lot of

00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,359
hobbies that result in an end product

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,200
and i enjoy doing them um and at first

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,960
when i first started i i didn't allow

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,960
myself to do any of them

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,160
because i was like this is sit on the

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,319
couch and watch

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,720
netflix time this is not where it goes

00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,680
and makes a really elaborate cake time

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,760
this is not doing things time and i've

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,720
since been able to work

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,480
elaborate cakes and hiking and reading

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,920
books and things back into my schedule

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,880
because those are things that i care

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,400
about

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,839
i mean those are those are hobbies those

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,480
are things that you give me if you film

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,760
it

00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,440
but at first i i focused on doing

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,800
nothing because i had to relearn how to

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,599
do nothing

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,000
and then as far as picking up a hobby is

00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,680
finding

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,480
something that's important to you to

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,720
fill your non-work time

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,839
i mean what go back to maybe what you

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,920
wanted to do

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,599
as a kid like when you were little what

00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,040
were you interested in it was probably i

00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,800
don't know space or dinosaurs would seem

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,800
really universal

00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,079
um a kid could tell you about space

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,480
dinosaurs all day long

00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,560
i got over my my space phase but i'll

00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,000
still go outside and look at stars

00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:15,440
that's fine i got back into baking after

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,040
years um actually i picked up baking as

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,119
a way to deal with anxiety

00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,560
years ago and picked it back up and

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,000
moved into cakes although i'm really

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,560
more into the

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,079
decorating than the making now but

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,760
really just

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,160
and if you can't pick anything if you're

00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,040
paralyzed for choice

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,240
there are dozens of if you can force

00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,200
yourself to go out and interact with

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,960
people if you're not like me

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,720
i'm a massive introvert there are tons

00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,319
of meetup groups that you can go and

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,240
like you only need to meet those people

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,079
once and if you're not into them

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,079
like if you're not into whatever they're

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,880
doing you never have to see those people

00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,480
again

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,960
you can try it out once and move on with

00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,520
your life it's it's okay to quit

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,520
something

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,839
if you don't like it you don't have to

00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,160
choose a hobby if you stuck with it

00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,440
forever

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:02,000

uh i'm a engineer at trulink financial

01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,280
i've actually been there for five whole

01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,039
days so that's really exciting for me

01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,720
and i'm on greater than code which is a

01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,680
tech podcast about kind of the human

01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,039
side of tech

01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,960
um which you can check out if you

01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,119

just please remember if you're going to

01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,440
post about me publicly that i use they

01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,760
them pronouns

01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,760
thanks

01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,000
but obviously what i really want to talk

01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,400
about is remote work so i have a couple

01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,480
of stats for the beginning this is from

01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,160
the stack overflow developers survey in

01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,480
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,920
so you can see that even in the before

01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,720
times of 2019

01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,400
not there there were about 12 percent of

01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,680
people who are full-time remote but more

01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,640
people who worked remote at least

01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,039
sometimes

01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,799
um so it is a thing i think it'll be

01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,760
really interesting to see the 2020

01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,680
stance

01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,119
um but i'm going to talk more about that

01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:15,359
later

01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,760
also in the stack overflow survey in

01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:20,079
2017 they asked a question about like

01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,280
what kind of priorities people have when

01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,400
they're looking for a new job what's

01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,480
important to them

01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,400
and 53 percent of people said that

01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,880
remote options were a top priority for

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,319
them

01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,000
so this is obviously something that's

01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:33,680
important to people and that

01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,280
we're all thinking about uh personally

01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,520
i've been in tech for about

01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,599
seven years and i've been working remote

01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,799
the whole time like 80 to 100

01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:44,480
remote um and when i tell people that

01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:46,079
it usually has a com we usually have a

01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,319
conversation that goes a little bit like

01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,319
this

01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,480
uh and i know that from working with

01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,240
other remote people

01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,520
these kind of responses are annoying to

01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,240
people

01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,079
and i understand why overall um people

01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,680
who have never worked remote sometimes

01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,760
act like it's a walk in the park

01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,599
and like it's not it's a real job you

01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,559
have to get just as much work done as an

01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:10,079
office job in fact i feel more guilty

01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,520
about taking breaks or whatever when i'm

01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,520
working from home

01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,559
because in an office water cooler chat

01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,160
is kind of a thing that happens

01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,680
naturally

01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:20,160
but at home it doesn't and it can be

01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:22,720
isolating not having that kind of chat

01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,839
this is an excerpt from a comic in the

01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,839
oatmeal but i can

01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:31,359
relate overall though

01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:34,160
my response is more like this

01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:35,280
because i really love working remote it

01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,039
works for me

01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,599
it helps me do my best work and it's

01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,839
awesome so i want to talk about why that

01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,839
is

01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,160
and i think i'll start by talking about

01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:49,520
some of just the general benefits from

01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:52,839
of remote work because anybody might

01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:55,039
have benefits it gives you more

01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:56,559
flexibility maybe you want to start your

01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,839
day a little earlier a little

01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,480
later that's usually fine maybe you have

01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,000
things to do

01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,200
at specific times during the day like

01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,640
you have to pick up your kid from

01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,400
daycare you can work around

01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,200
that those kind of things normally more

01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,680
easily than an office

01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,200
not having to commute is gives you a lot

01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,200
more flexibility too

01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,480
this is a big one for me living in

01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,000
buffalo a

01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,079
because we don't have good public

01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,400
transportation here and b

01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,079
because we have bad weather and i don't

01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,680
want to dig out my car in the winter

01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,680
so this is this is great for me

01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,599
it gives you the freedom to work from

01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,559
anywhere um obviously we're not

01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,319
traveling right now

01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,920
but normally i would be traveling a lot

01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:37,039
and it's nice to be able to work from

01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,680
wherever i go

01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:41,440
like if i go to texas to visit my family

01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:44,000
i don't have to take a week off

01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,200
i can work during the day and spend time

01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,319
with them in the evenings and it gives

01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,319
me more time with my family

01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,599
your mileage may vary with this one some

01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,520
people find it difficult to work from

01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,480
home and not get distracted by home

01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,839
stuff

01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,079
it's really not for everyone it's a

01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,520
personal preference obviously this one's

01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,200
out the window right now because we have

01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,000
lots of distractions again i'm going to

01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,240
talk more about that

01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,760
later but personally i find that my

01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,520
productivity is a lot better when i'm

01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,039
working from home i don't have people

01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,720
walking around me in an office

01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,640
i don't have them coming up and talking

01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,000
to me about things i can really go heads

01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:19,839
down and like get work done

01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,599
and i love that

01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:23,119
plus just like being comfortable in your

01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,880
space is like huge

01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,680
it's not to be understated it's a big

01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,680
factor for people

01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,640
so again that list was kind of in

01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,680
general and i think the word benefits is

01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,039
kind of interesting

01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,119
because it can kind of mean two

01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,960
different things i read a lot of

01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,079
definitions of the word benefits when i

01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,640
was working on this talk

01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,400
i like this one a lot of them also used

01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,680
the word advantageous which i thought

01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,960
was interesting

01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,799
and it kind of gets at that first

01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,920
definition of benefits it's something

01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:51,440
that's nice to have

01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,760
makes your life a little better a little

01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,039
more convenient

01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,000
but there's another way that we use the

01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,520
term benefits like our benefits package

01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,119
and there are people for whom remote

01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,799
work is more than just a little bit of

01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,720
extra convenience

01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,839
some benefits make it possible to do

01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,240
something that you wouldn't have been

01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:09,520
able to otherwise do

01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,079
and remote work is one of those things

01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,760
for me so while it's cool to think about

01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,000
what benefits you want to give people i

01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,640
think

01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,359
it can be more helpful to think about

01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,440
like what

01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,200
problem or barrier you want to help them

01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,039
solve

01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,720
normally here in this talk i would do a

01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,200
couple of slides next about why it's

01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:29,359
important to strive for a diverse team

01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,039
i had to trim for time and that's what i

01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,240
decided to trim because i figure that

01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,400
anyone who's coming

01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,000
to a conference like artifacts probably

01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,960
already knows that diversity is

01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,839
important

01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,359
so i'm gonna go straight into examples

01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:42,000
of kind of different demographics of

01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:44,559
people who might

01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,760
benefit and what barriers and problems

01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:47,760
remote work might be solving

01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,839
first i'm going to talk about chronic

01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,200
illness and disability this has to be

01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:57,119
kind of general because there's lots of

01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,480
different kind of illness and disability

01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,680
and they have different challenges and

01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,319
needs

01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,559
that said i will disclose that i have

01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:06,000
pretty severe anxiety disorder

01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,599
and it's a big part of the reason that

01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,480
working from home feels very critical

01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,160
for me

01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,920
um so i'm going to talk to my experience

01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,920
about that specifically also

01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:19,040
lots of different disabilities have

01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,319
different accessibility

01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,880
concerns and need different

01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,560
accommodations it's likely that the best

01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,199
ones are going to be at someone's own

01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,719
house

01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:28,640
where they can control all of the

01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,799
variables and feel very comfortable in

01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,440
the space

01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,920
accessibility concerns can also kind of

01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,120
go

01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:39,600
flow into difficulties getting to work

01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,679
but i've experienced that too before i

01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,480
was fully remote i used to miss a ton of

01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,120
work

01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,799
because sometimes i just felt too bad to

01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,440
get out of bed in the morning

01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,560
but like i could still work if i could

01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,040
work from my bed

01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,960
in fact working helps me as a

01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,640
distraction when i'm having bad anxiety

01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,080
so it's wonderful to be able to work for

01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,080
my bed when i'm having a bad day

01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,960
flexible working hours are great for

01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:07,679
everybody but some people need them for

01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,440
more tangible reasons than other people

01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,679
if i have like a panic attack early in

01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,279
the morning i pretty much need to go

01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,440
back to sleep for a couple of hours or

01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:17,759
i'm going to be totally useless

01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,199
so if i can start a little bit late and

01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,520
work a little bit late

01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:23,359
now there's a whole day that i'm working

01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,560
that i would have otherwise had to like

01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,120
call in sick

01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,719
and miss the whole day but i don't need

01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,159
the whole day

01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,440
also if you have chronic illness and you

01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,040
have frequent doctor's appointments

01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,839
related to it that requires a lot of

01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,839
flexibility too

01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:42,719
energy conservation i do another talk

01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,279
about spoon theory specifically which is

01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,960
kind of a metaphor that describes how we

01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,839
ration our energy

01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,679
uh in a day the spoons are the the unit

01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:54,719
of energy that we spend

01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:56,640
and people with chronic illness have

01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,840
to ration their energy in a more real

01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:02,000
way than other people

01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:03,679
and if you don't have to like get

01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,600
dressed you don't have to commute to

01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,120
work those are things that might be

01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,800
taking up a lot of energy especially if

01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,960
you have like chronic pain

01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:14,400
now you can spend that energy like going

01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,400
straight into your day and that's great

01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:18,400
also lots of people who struggle with

01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,600
illness just have good days and bad days

01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,960
and you might not want people to see

01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,320
your bad days

01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,400
for me that kind of means that if i have

01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,000
a panic attack at home you know it sucks

01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,840
i'm not having a great day

01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,120
but if i have a panic attack at work it

01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,080
feels really awful and it's really

01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,239
embarrassing

01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,080
so just being able to turn my video off

01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:37,040
if i'm having a bad day like preserves a

01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,040
lot of privacy

01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,199
again this has to be really general

01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,960
because i'm kind of like sweeping in a

01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:48,239
lot of different underrepresented

01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:50,719
groups of people in tech but i think

01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:52,480
energy conservation is a big thing again

01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,920
spoon theory was really invented

01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,880
specifically to talk about chronic

01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,719
illness

01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,080
but i do think underrepresented folks

01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:01,520
have to use more energy

01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:04,000
at work for a few different reasons

01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,760
code switching is one of them we often

01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,560
talk about bringing your whole self to

01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,640
work

01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,280
it's really nice in theory i try to do

01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,120
it but realistically nobody really does

01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,560
it because of course the way you talk to

01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,280
your co-workers is different than the

01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,800
way you talk to your friends and family

01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,960
and that's much more true if you're not

01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,719
part of like the majority in group

01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,880
this might mean that like the slaying

01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,000
you'd use around your friends that are

01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,080
from your same ethnic group

01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,159
is different for me it means that the

01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,000
way i talk around a group where everyone

01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:34,000
is queer is very different

01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,920
and there's an energy across associated

01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,040
with making those kind of decisions

01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,040
about how you communicate

01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:42,880
microaggressions i could do a whole talk

01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,320
on um but basically what i'm talking

01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,719
about here is like small

01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:48,560
indirect often unintentional

01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,480
discriminations against minority groups

01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,159
and these things happen in the office

01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,719
this might be things like off-colored

01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:55,679
jokes you know making assumptions about

01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,280
people

01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:00,159
for me getting misgendered is a big

01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,520
example they're small

01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:04,960
they might not be malicious but they

01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,960
still add up and take energy

01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,080
i think this is related actually this

01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,719
idea of like fitting in

01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:14,239
someone once told me a story of working

01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,000
in a series of jobs where they were the

01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:17,760
only latino in the office and they

01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,679
always felt like none of their coworkers

01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,960
really fully understood them

01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,199
and then they worked at a place for the

01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,719
first time that was 100 remote

01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:26,400
and there were people from all over the

01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,719
world on that team

01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,719
and they felt for the first time like oh

01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,679
everyone here is different from everyone

01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,679
else so i don't

01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:35,040
stick out in any way we're all just

01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,920
coming together

01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,280
i thought that story was really cool and

01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,000
they expressed to me that like it was a

01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,000
really good feeling

01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:48,159
it can also be really expensive to work

01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,520
like think about someone who's coming

01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,679
from an underprivileged back

01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,199
underprivileged background who just did

01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,040
a boot camp and they're like out looking

01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:57,040
for their first tech job

01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,800
maybe they can't afford a nice wardrobe

01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,640
to wear to the office yet

01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,080
maybe everyone wants to go out to lunch

01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,360
and they can't afford that and it makes

01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,600
them feel left out

01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,560
even transportation to and from work

01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,239
might be a problem

01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,800
and you're cutting all of those concerns

01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,800
right out

01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,159
i think location-based diversity is

01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,679
actually really interesting

01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:19,840
because people who come from different

01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:22,239
places and live in different places

01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,840
and have different backgrounds have

01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:25,600
different perspectives and having a lot

01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,800
of different perspectives on your team

01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,640
makes it better and more thoughtful

01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,560
but there's lots of reasons why people

01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,239
might not be able to live in major urban

01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,679
areas where a lot of tech jobs

01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:38,640
are first of all it's extremely

01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,719
expensive

01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,360
to live in like new york or san

01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,360
francisco

01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,960
people might have family obligations

01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,719
that they don't want to move away

01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,480
to the big city and like leave their

01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,159
family behind

01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,920
that might be more common in other

01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:55,199
cultures other than like american

01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,040
culture

01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:01,679
because people think about their family

01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:02,960
in a different way which is super valid

01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:04,560
it's great to have people from other

01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,400
countries on your team too but they

01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,480
might not be able to easily

01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,440
like physically come to the states and

01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,440
work at your office

01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,719
these are all things that might affect

01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,880
anybody

01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,719
but i think they disproportionately

01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,040
affect people from underrepresented

01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,239
backgrounds because

01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,159
they come from different cultures

01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,960
different places a lot of us come from

01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,520
under

01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,000
privileged backgrounds so this is kind

01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,360
of

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,360
hitting hard on that group again

01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,560
i do want to talk specifically about the

01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:41,040
trans community for a few reasons

01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:42,640
um i'm trans talk about what you know

01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,320
there's a lot of trans people working in

01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,679
tech though and it's growing

01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,280
which means the likelihood that you

01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,080
already have a trans person on your team

01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,880
or you will

01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,320
or more than one is like growing and

01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,199
understanding this perspective will help

01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:57,360
you be a better coworker

01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:59,520
i also think the reason that that is is

01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,560
because not all industries

01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,239
you can work remote but you can in tuck

01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,480
and i think remote jobs can be really

01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:11,679
uniquely attractive to trans people

01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:14,800
so i'll talk about the reasons why

01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,719
transitioning at work is really hard

01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,400
actually transitioning in general is

01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,320
really hard it's just a huge

01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,080
change in one's life for the better but

01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,199
like any period of intense change is

01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,880
really hard

01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:27,199
plus you also have to worry about if

01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,719
people are going to be respectful of you

01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:30,640
which is frustrating

01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,920
but even if you're in a good situation

01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,840
where everyone at your job

01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,840
wants to be respectful of you which

01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,520
unfortunately isn't always the case

01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,840
but even if so there are still unique

01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,840
challenges

01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,560
a lot of trans people have a lot of

01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,679
baggage about like clothes and their

01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,280
wardrobe

01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:50,640
that can be make it really hard to

01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:52,719
navigate like business casual

01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,400
also a lot of people have to essentially

01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,120
replace their entire wardrobe when they

01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,800
come out

01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,960
and that's really tough to do all at

01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,360
once and it happens over time

01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:06,560
so newly out trans people often don't

01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:08,560
have a lot of clothes it's hard to

01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,560
explain how stressful it is to use the

01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:13,280
bathroom in public when you're trans

01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:15,760
uh you might have some of an idea from

01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:18,560
seeing like bathroom laws on the news

01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,159
um but trust me it's just better for me

01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,719
to use the gender-neutral bathroom in my

01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,719
own house

01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:28,239
um i feel super self-conscious about my

01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,199
appearance a lot of times but if that's

01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,640
not bad enough

01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:32,560
transitioning often comes with like

01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,159
awkward teenage phases especially if

01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,800
you're on hormones

01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:37,600
it can be very uncomfortable to be seen

01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,960
every day

01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,800
so it can be a relief to just be able to

01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,239
turn off the camera again

01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,320
also some people really want to keep

01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:45,120
their transition private um which is

01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,719
super valid

01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,840
this idea of just like emerging out of a

01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,840
cocoon i get it

01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,239
even well-meaning co-workers are

01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,440
sometimes going to mess up on name and

01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:57,040
pronouns

01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,560
it's easier to practice and get it right

01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,760
over text-based communication because

01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,640
you can be more thoughtful and catch

01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,080
yourself

01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,600
in my old company everyone was really

01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,440
respectful and slack they always got it

01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,800
right but in person

01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,040
people slipped up and it made it like

01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,960
really tough for me also it's

01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:14,000
anxiety inducing to correct people and

01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,000
it's easier over text

01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:17,679
plus like not all trans people have

01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,440
surgeries but a lot of us do i did

01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:21,440
uh two years ago and i was worried about

01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,480
taking off time from work but i ended up

01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,840
being able

01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,280
to take off less time than i thought

01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,760
because i couldn't really get up and

01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:29,199
move around but again i could work

01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,880
and people weren't perceiving my

01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:33,440
physical form while i was recovering

01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,440
which was nice

01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,320
so we've talked about the benefits of

01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,239
remote work but there's also cons

01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,000
there's already a lot of articles that

01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,440
go into the challenges of remote work

01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,719
and give tips

01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,400
now that we're in the situation we're in

01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:46,880
we're seeing a lot more of that which is

01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,560
nice

01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,920
because it's nice that people who are

01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,000
already good at remote work want to

01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,679
support people who are new to it

01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,600
but actually the phrase already good at

01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:58,800
remote work is kind of what i'm getting

01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,440
at this remote mindset remote work isn't

01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,000
easy

01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,120
it takes work it doesn't come naturally

01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,120
to everyone

01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,120
but it's a skill that you can practice

01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,880
and get better at

01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,480
a healthy remote environment doesn't

01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,000
just happen

01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,360
you have to be intentional about what

01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,920
you want to look like and how you're

01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,920
going to get there

01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,840
so i'm going to talk about some tips um

01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,440
some specific ones

01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,920
first i want to talk about text-based

01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,719
communication not all communication for

01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,280
remote people

01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:29,040
is via text but like a ton of it is i

01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,880
think these tips will help anybody but i

01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:32,320
do think that they'll particularly help

01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,880
people like me who struggle with mental

01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,320
illness

01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,080
um so this is kind of like personal

01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,280
stuff

01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:40,320
there's reasons why text-based

01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:42,239
communication is works for me

01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,920
one of my anxiety symptoms is memory

01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,960
lamps so it's really helpful to be able

01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,960
to go back and review

01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:50,239
exactly what people said later to to

01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,239
remember the context of it

01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:54,080
being put on the spot with questions is

01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,400
also anxiety inducing for me

01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,920
so async culture helps a lot with that

01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,640
but even if someone needs an answer

01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,320
right away

01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,679
i still get to think a little bit more

01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,600
about how i'm going to word it when i'm

01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:06,159
typing

01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,679
but it can be tough too my anxiety makes

01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,000
me worry a lot about tone and i read

01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:10,640
into

01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,400
people's words a lot so i think it's

01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,000
important to err on the side of over

01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,760
communicating you know tell me

01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,199
explicitly if your inquiry is urgent or

01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,960
non-urgent

01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:20,400
don't be afraid afraid to just clarify

01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,199
your tone even if it feels a little

01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,120
awkward

01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:26,159
it sounds silly but i think emojis can

01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:29,840
really like convey some nuance sometimes

01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:32,239
my old company had a slack emoji wyc

01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,840
which stood for when you can it's

01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:35,600
actually an acronym that my dad and i

01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,920
made up when i was like growing up

01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,520
because he would text me and be like

01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,960
call me and then i would freak out like

01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,640
why what's going on and i would call him

01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,000
in a panic and he wanted to tell me like

01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,080
a funny story

01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,760
so we invented when you can to kind of

01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:51,920
denote it's not important in that way

01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,600
and that's about context too the worst

01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,440
possible thing for my anxiety is like

01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,800
can you hop on a call right now

01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,159
because then i'm like what is it urgent

01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,440
am i in trouble what's it about does

01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:01,120
something bad happen is someone getting

01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:03,360
fired am i getting fired

01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:04,800
i'm reading into it like a thousand ways

01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,520
if you just said hey can you cop on a

01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,679
call right now

01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,679
it's time sensitive but not an emergency

01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,520
and it relates to this project

01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:15,520
it's a few more seconds to type out but

01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,520
it cuts out a lot of anxiety on my end

01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,719
you're already kind of doing the first

01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,239
step to becoming a good advocate by

01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:23,600
listening to me talk right now

01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:25,440
um getting a sense of some of these

01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,840
perspectives is like a really good first

01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,960
step

01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:31,440
i also have some actionable tips

01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,000
i love this idea of remote first culture

01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,440
even if not

01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,120
everybody is remote remote first

01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,800
when some people are remote and others

01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,159
aren't the remote people tend to miss

01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,040
out on conversations that are happening

01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:42,639
in person

01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,960
that might mean socially just not

01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,400
getting to know people as well

01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,800
but that could mean you're passed up for

01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,080
opportunities sometimes people even get

01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,080
left out of conversations that are

01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:53,760
relevant to projects that they work on

01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,880
like not maliciously two people just

01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,000
meet in the hall like hey let's talk

01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,199
about that project

01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,440
but it makes it really hard to work

01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:00,560
effectively when you're not included

01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,320
these are all things that

01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,679
underrepresented folks already struggle

01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,440
more with than other people

01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,920
so remote work if done wrong can make

01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,920
that worse

01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,239
if you notice someone being left out

01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:14,000
just say something hey we should talk

01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:15,840
about that project but we should include

01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,639
jamie let's wait until we can get them

01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,800
on a call with us

01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:22,000
this one's kind of a personal pet peeve

01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,440
but i hate

01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,199
being on a call where there's like a

01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,360
bunch of people in a room together and

01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:29,040
then a few people have called in

01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,400
i cannot keep up with the conversation

01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,560
that's happening in that room

01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,600
there's lag there's noise i can't speak

01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,600
up fast enough

01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,440
it literally makes me feel more left out

01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,840
than just not inviting me

01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:41,440
to a meeting in my old company i

01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,040
complained a lot about this and then we

01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,560
started making everyone phone in

01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,920
individually like all the people at the

01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,120
office had their own laptop and

01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,960
headphones

01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,239
and it was way better even though they

01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:56,000
were together i felt like i was on the

01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:57,600
same playing field as them

01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,520
i could not possibly cover all

01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,840
microaggressions as i said

01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,760
but in general a good way to support

01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,679
underrepresented folks in the workplace

01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,360
is to get better at identifying

01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:10,400
microaggressions so that you

01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:12,239
a you cannot do them and b

01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,080
you can stop other people when they do

01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:15,679
them

01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,960
i'm gonna talk about a couple that are

01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:20,480
like super relevant to some of the

01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,480
specific things i've already brought up

01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,199
don't comment on people's appearance

01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,560
there's no reason it only makes people

01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,000
feel uncomfortable

01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,159
i don't mean like i like your new

01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,520
haircut but like maybe someone's looking

01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:33,600
under the weather

01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,639
maybe they have like some awkward acne

01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,719
that they're going through

01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,000
maybe they're wearing their pajamas it's

01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,400
just easy and cost zero

01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,760
dollars not to say anything about it and

01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,760
make them feel weird about it

01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,239
a lot of places push for video on all

01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,920
the time during calls

01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:51,199
i actually really get that i do think

01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,880
there's value in that it's like

01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,000
fostering more of a relationship between

01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,440
co-workers

01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,199
but if there's someone who has to keep

01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,880
their video off sometimes there's

01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,920
probably a reason that they feel more

01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,520
comfortable with that

01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,920
so again just don't make them feel weird

01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,920
about it

01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,360
correct pronouns are not just for when

01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:11,199
you're with somebody

01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,520
um this is something i get a lot of

01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:15,120
stress about like if there are people in

01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,920
person together in an office and i'm

01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,159
remote

01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,840
i worry a lot like am i getting

01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,440
misgendered in the office when i'm not

01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,960
there to hear it

01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,920
just don't let that happen it's

01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,520
disrespectful it's also bad practice for

01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,360
when you are with that person

01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,600
makes it more likely to slip up and then

01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,120
you're going to make them feel bad

01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,199
i do want to add a caveat to this that

01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:36,560
it's pretty personal not all trans folks

01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:38,320
want you to like correct other people

01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,679
when they're not there

01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,760
so it's maybe something you should like

01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:43,199
ask and talk about but like

01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:49,840
i would really appreciate this and i

01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:49,840
think that's true of a lot of people

01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:55,280
i would be remiss if i didn't talk

01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,800
specifically about the situation that

01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:00,560
we're in right now

01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:02,159
um i wrote this talk actually before

01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,600
the pandemic and then i gave it for the

01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,400
first time after the pandemic so that

01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,280
was weird

01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:08,800
to for my topic to become so topical but

01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,239
it is topical because there are lots of

01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,840
people who are working from home for the

01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:15,440
first time right now

01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,440
um if you're one of those people welcome

01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:19,120
in some ways it's kind of a huge

01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,480
revolution there's a lot of people who

01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,159
have been trying to advocate

01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:24,159
about why remote work would work for

01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:25,360
them for like all of the reasons that i

01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,880
just said

01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,440
and a lot of companies were telling them

01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:32,480
like well we can't

01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:35,120
well guess what uh we obviously can

01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,639
because we are and we had to figure it

01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,239
out

01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:40,719
and i think that it's going to be kind

01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:42,320
of hard to put it back in that box

01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:43,600
if someone has been pushing that remote

01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,080
work would be helpful for them and you

01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,159
said we

01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,600
can't it's going to be hard to tell them

01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:50,880
like well we can't again

01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,280
so come back to the office on the other

01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,520
hand

01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,800
i think a lot of people who are working

01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,600
from home right now for the first time

01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,719
are saying like

01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,360
well this sucks well guess what of

01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,920
course it

01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,040
sucks because we're in a pandemic and

01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,440
everything sucks

01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,880
you know suddenly becoming remote um

01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,880
during covid is like

01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,760
not a healthy remote environment which

01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:13,360
again you really have to foster

01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,199
it's not what remote work is normally

01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,480
like you're not under

01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:18,719
you're not normally under all this

01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,280
stress you're not normally stuck in your

01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:21,360
house

01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,400
all the time with your spouse who's also

01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,840
working from home

01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:27,040
and like your kids who can't go to

01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,800
school and it's so distracting

01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,639
i do have worries that people are just

01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,080
going to have experienced remote work in

01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:32,800
this way and be like well our artwork

01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,719
sucks

01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,080
it doesn't suck being in a global

01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:37,760
pandemic sucks

01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:41,840
remote work is great for a lot of people

01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,840
although again it's not for everyone

01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:45,840
so i'm really curious what's going to

01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,560
happen you know in the future a year

01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,600
from now

01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:51,280
a couple of years from now it's hard to

01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,760
even really speculate about it in a lot

01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,520
of ways

01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,040
because gosh dang it we just don't know

01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,960
what the world is going to be like in a

01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:58,960
few months

01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:01,040
um i gave this talk for the first time a

01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,639
few months ago and i said that and i had

01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:05,360
no idea what it was going to be like

01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,639
right now and it's still true

01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,719
but i do think that while we're in a

01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:10,159
tough situation right now if we're

01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,159
intentional about it

01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:14,080
we can let it change the landscape in

01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:14,400
ways that are exciting and are going to

01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,280
help

01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:19,280
people long term if we integrate remote

01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,960
work as just a more standard part of our

01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,960
lives

01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,600
you know i think if we try to treat this

01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:27,440
like an opportunity as best we can

01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,719
we'll be able to reap benefits long term

01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:32,000
even from being in this like

01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:32,000
really bad situation

01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:37,840
and i think that would be great if

01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:37,840
something good can come out of it

01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,920
i will post this on slack so don't worry

01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,600
about this right now

01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,000
but this is just a couple of their talks

01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:49,120
um the my spoon theory talk from

01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,199
railsconf 2017 which i mentioned

01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,560
things i wish i knew before going remote

01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:55,679
by marla zasheen

01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:57,840
was a talk at railsconf 2019

01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:59,760
like i said there's lots of remote work

01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,679
talks but i happen to like this one a

01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,480
lot

01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:06,480
uh trans eye for the cis ally was given

01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,880
by my friend julian fitzpatrick

01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:10,320
a really excellent talk that goes more

01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,520
in depth into some of the things that i

01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:15,199
didn't have time for

01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,560
like bathrooms and like

01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:18,719
kind of really gives you a good

01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,360
perspective on what your trans coworkers

01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:25,199
might be thinking at any given time

01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:25,199
that was also from rosecon 2019.

01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,400
um but overall just thank you thank you

01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,400
for listening this is really important

01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:35,120
to me it's great to be part of

01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,000
a conference like artifacts even like

01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,600
especially now

01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,320
it's so great that we can still be doing

01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,960
some events um it's hard to give talks

01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,440
virtually

01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,880
so i'm looking forward to talking to

01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:47,040
people after

01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,080
getting a little bit of feedback but you

01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:51,199
know stay safe

01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:52,320
stay healthy it's really important and i

01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:54,800
think i'm gonna

01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:56,560
answer some questions like approximately

01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,760
right now

01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,920
uh you are approximately correct um yeah

01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,880
so thank you jamie for your talk it was

01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,480
really great

01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,320
um i really liked all the points at the

01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:08,159
end where you talked about you know

01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,520
there's remote work but also we're kind

01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:11,280
of in this room at work during a

01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,840
pandemic which happens to be different

01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:16,000
and i remember scott hanselman tweeting

01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:18,080
that he had worked from home for

01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,679
like at least 12 years i don't remember

01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,360
what the number was and how he said

01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:23,280
um this is the first time he's been

01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:26,320
absolutely exhausted

01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:27,360
doing it just from the pandemic by the

01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:30,000
way this is my co-host

01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,480
theodosius so say hi they're giving us a

01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,840
very

01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:37,120
um authentic remote experience right now

01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:40,159
yes i like your way of mentioning that

01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,440
um somebody had asked and you have

01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:44,480
thoughts on

01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:45,360
good or bad ways of hopefully not too

01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:48,800
many bad ways

01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:51,440
um to give fully or mostly remote work

01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:54,080
folks opportunities specifically for

01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:55,520
social interaction

01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,760
yeah i think it's kind of interesting

01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:59,600
because we're seeing a lot of

01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,040
we're trying a lot of different things

01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,719
right now um

01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,480
at that like we're trying even during

01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,679
this conference we're trying having like

01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,760
these discussion rooms and these

01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,679
breakout rooms in the hallway track

01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,199
um and my job like i mentioned i just

01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:13,679
started a new job

01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:15,199
um and like normally i would go in to

01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:17,040
their office for

01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:18,880
onboarding but i haven't been able to so

01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:22,159
they've scheduled me like half hour

01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:24,080
virtual coffee dates basically with a

01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:26,880
bunch of my new co-workers and like just

01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:28,159
talk for a half hour like not about work

01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:32,480
um and it's been really that's been

01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:35,040
really great um so i think it's kind of

01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:36,880
like just being aware of it is like the

01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:39,600
really big first step like if you

01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,560
are if you realize that your remote

01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,880
folks aren't getting the same

01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,560
opportunities then you can

01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,840
try to be intentional about that but if

01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,480
you don't think about it and don't

01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,600
realize

01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:50,480
that's when it's it gets really bad i

01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,960
guess

01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:54,880
but i am keeping an eye out for like

01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:58,320
what works and what doesn't work about

01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:01,760
social like online social activities

01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:02,400
so i'll keep you updated and somebody

01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,080
had mentioned

01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:06,000
uh are there ways to do it without

01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:09,679
involving zoom calls and jack box

01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,480
games which um i think our talk from

01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:13,840
jenny bramble on saturday should help

01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,760
mention a few of these things so

01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,520
hopefully we can answer those then

01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:20,000
um some may have wondered is there a way

01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,880
to respectfully share a busy home

01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,639
so not um hurting the space that your

01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,159
kids or spouse might have with any of

01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:28,800
your work related stress

01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:29,760
oh that's that one's really tough um i'm

01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,560
lucky because

01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,000
i mentioned being in a busy home but i'm

01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,960
actually personally

01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,320
not in one so not to rub it in but i

01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,159
think in general like

01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,679
a general tip with remote work is that

01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:45,040
it's really important to have

01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:46,719
like a designated remote space um

01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,800
even if you're not sharing a busy home

01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:50,719
just the idea of like this is the seat

01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,400
i'm sitting in when i'm working and when

01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:54,159
i sit in the seat i'm working

01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,840
and when i go sit in another room i'm

01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:56,880
not working because like the line

01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,719
between

01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,480
working and not working can be really

01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,719
tough when you're remote sometimes

01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,239
so that's a tip you'll hear a lot and i

01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:06,159
think that like

01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:07,679
if you're serious about respecting that

01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:10,880
kind of space

01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:13,760
um like that kind of ties into

01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,600
what is being asked to there but i don't

01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,000
know if you don't have enough space to

01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,040
do that

01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,719
it's just really tough um i used to go

01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,040
and like work at the coffee shop

01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:24,480
a lot and obviously i haven't really

01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:27,040
been able to do that

01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,560
but my local coffee shop i missed it so

01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:31,520
much when i was closed

01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,480
that like i went and sat on the benches

01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,480
outside of it

01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,600
they used to like put out tables and

01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,800
they're not putting out tables right now

01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,360
because they're not open

01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,239
so i brought my own like tv tray table

01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:42,639
and set it up

01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:44,239
and like worked outside of my coffee

01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:48,239
shop by myself

01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:52,239
and it felt better brilliant i

01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:52,239
really kind of like that um

01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:56,000
one of my co-working spaces has closed

01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,000
just for

01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,120
safety things so i've been very kind of

01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,639
curious

01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:03,679
uh now i'm trying to think through like

01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:06,080
where can i go that doesn't evolve

01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:07,520
like where can i take a tvs tray it

01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,360
feels great to work outside

01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:12,400
actually i totally recommend it if you

01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:14,880
can yeah um

01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,960
so i was also kind of curious you know

01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,800
in theory this pandemic will eventually

01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,560
subside and we won't live in a weird

01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,239
dystopian world anymore

01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,600
um you had a lot of great suggestions

01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:26,159
for remote work

01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,280
um and theory we're gonna go back to an

01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:29,679
in-person world

01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,560
um how do you think might be a good way

01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:33,920
to make sure we

01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:35,920
achieve inclusivity um when we do early

01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,880
some of us transition back to

01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,880
in-person offices

01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,960
yeah that's a good question i think that

01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,120
like

01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,040
in terms of inclusivity in general in

01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,320
offices that's kind of like a big one

01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:51,120
that we could talk about

01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:52,239
for a long time for me it's all about

01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:54,239
respect

01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:56,320
i do think that like it's gonna be

01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:57,360
interesting when we go back to in-person

01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,719
offices

01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,480
for kind of the reason i was getting it

01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:01,760
at the end like not everyone's gonna

01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:05,600
want to

01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:08,719
and i think that that's really valid and

01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,679
i hope that we can like be thoughtful

01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:12,159
and mature

01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:14,320
about deciding how we're gonna go back

01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:16,880
and like how we're gonna let

01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:18,639
people make that decision for themselves

01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,120
and i'm kind of hoping that this will

01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:23,040
happen naturally because like

01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,159
as things are starting to open back up

01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,239
right now

01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:28,239
not everybody some people are like

01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:31,600
starting to

01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:33,840
do some stuff some people you know i go

01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,040
out and do things with my mask and i go

01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,880
to the grocery store

01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:40,480
and you know um i'm careful but i'm out

01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,440
at about a little bit but some people

01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,719
still aren't at all and like not wanting

01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:46,880
to be out

01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:50,080
and about as super valid and so i think

01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:52,480
that when we first start opening offices

01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:54,080
like the only reasonable thing you can

01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,679
do is let people choose

01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:57,840
whether or not they feel comfortable

01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:59,920
coming back yet because it's not like

01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:02,239
kovid's gonna get turned off one day

01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,080
it's gonna like get slowly better

01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:05,760
and so i'm hoping that if we already

01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:07,760
have to kind of

01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:09,920
approach it that way it'll make it more

01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,560
easier it'll make it easier overall to

01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,679
say

01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:16,239
well why don't we let people choose if

01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:17,679
like what they feel comfortable doing um

01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:19,679
my last job

01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:22,000
was based in new york city and i was in

01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:23,600
buffalo so obviously i was remote

01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,920
but some of the engineering team like

01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,679
was physically in new york city

01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:29,760
and like they still didn't go into the

01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,600
office because like the office

01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,199
um environment like didn't work as well

01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,880
for them and i thought it was like cool

01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:36,719
that my company was giving them that

01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,639
option to work remote even though like

01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,440
they were physically capable of coming

01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,320
in

01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:44,560
yeah all right so we're out of qa time

awesome so yeah today i'm going to be

01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,719
talking about the awakenings in the

01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:54,639
system that support it

01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:56,239
and i know with everything that's going

01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:59,119
on in today's world

01:47:56,239 --> 01:48:00,960
it's hard to tune in to a lot of things

01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:02,719
because it's hard to focus so i just

01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,679
want to say thank you to everyone who's

01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:05,840
tuned in

01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,199
and sharing space with me today i really

01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,000
appreciate it

01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:12,159
i had an amazing intro so i don't have

01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,800
to talk that much about myself which is

01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:15,360
great

01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,800
because i am an awkward person and we

01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:19,679
need to have less time

01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:20,800
with me being awkward recorded out there

01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:23,040
on the internets

01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,560
so i appreciate that i just want to go

01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,040
ahead and throw out there that tech by

01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,440
choice

01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,159
is a community for all underrepresented

01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:31,040
groups

01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:32,000
and we try to help people learn that

01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:34,159
tech is a

01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,400
place for them and we do that in a very

01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:38,560
authentic way by making sure that we

01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:40,800
cover vocational skills as well as

01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:43,920
career and personal development

01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:46,320
just yesterday we had an open and honest

01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:47,760
discussion about mental health so that's

01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,960
really cool and some of the stuff that

01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:51,360
we work on

01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,239
if you want to connect with me my handle

01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:55,360
is digital

01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:56,800
blk hippie i'm on twitter a lot when i'm

01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:59,360
not doing community work

01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,080
and coding so yeah let's continue the

01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:02,719
conversation

01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:04,800
there i'm i'm on that platform way too

01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:06,400
much

01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,480
so i'm going to go ahead and jump into

01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:10,560
this talk

01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:12,719
and when i was working on this talk and

01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:14,639
creating the slides i realized that

01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:16,800
in order to have a discussion about

01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:19,440
racism we have to be honest

01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,119
and i was looking at the title and i

01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:23,520
realized that the title i originally

01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:25,760
came up with was a disservice to

01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,719
marginalized communities and individuals

01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:30,000
who've been speaking

01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:31,920
up about the injustices and how these

01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,239
systems that are created

01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:36,080
were never created equally they were

01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:39,440
never created with

01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:40,560
everyone in mind and they were not

01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:42,639
created so that

01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:43,599
marginalized communities can succeed in

01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:46,960
them

01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:48,480
so it's not it was not marginalized

01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,719
people who were asleep

01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:53,119
it was other people who refused to

01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:56,000
listen to the lived experiences

01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:58,000
of these communities and really take it

01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,199
in and be active listeners to what's

01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:03,040
going wrong

01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:04,800
who are now waking up and so

01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,320
i know with everything that's been going

01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,639
on with 2020

01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,440
i feel like one of the main things that

01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:11,119
is changing

01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:14,000
is that we're starting to notice that

01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:15,920
the that we're having a white awakening

01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,719
and we're starting to notice the systems

01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,719
that support it

01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:23,679
and i know i'm saying that it's a white

01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:26,560
awakening

01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:27,280
but i want to make a point to to

01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,119
everyone

01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:30,480
that is not just white people who are

01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:33,520
becoming aware

01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:35,679
instead it's this imperialistic mindset

01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:37,119
that's based off of racism and

01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:40,000
colonization

01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:42,159
and all these other things that created

01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,159
periods like the manifest destiny

01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:45,360
and many others that i can point out in

01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:48,080
our history

01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:48,800
that has caused a number of people to

01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,880
treat

01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:52,400
marginalized communities across the

01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:54,880
globe differently

01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:56,000
if we look at western western

01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:59,520
communities

01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:02,719
and western civilizations we know that

01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:03,840
there are a group of people who don't

01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:05,760
have european

01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:08,719
standards of beauty and they're treated

01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:10,639
differently the same way people who

01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,840
have different religious backgrounds are

01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:14,320
treated differently

01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:15,040
and how the world views darker skin

01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:18,239
tones

01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:19,199
as a negative the same way that gender

01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:22,080
expressions

01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:23,040
that fall out of the binary are viewed

01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:26,320
as wrong

01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:29,520
in the same way that when your sexuality

01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:31,440
is not hetero it's seen as strange

01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:33,520
these are all ideals that come out of

01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:35,599
these systems that were not designed for

01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:37,679
us

01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:39,520
and there's one that's very important

01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:42,639
that i want to talk about

01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:45,840
and i want to say that transphobia kills

01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:47,119
we know that we understand that but it's

01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:50,159
still running rampant

01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:50,159
in our communities

01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:56,159
and it's not always

01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:58,159
white communities who are causing and

01:51:56,159 --> 01:52:00,400
benefiting from this harm

01:51:58,159 --> 01:52:02,719
we understand that these ideals stem

01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:03,840
from racism and parallelism and things

01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,400
like that

01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:08,880
but we need to understand that people

01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:11,760
who benefit from these systems

01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:14,080
are the people who are still in power so

01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:14,719
no matter how deadly these viewpoints

01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:18,400
are and

01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:21,199
the behaviors that these systems support

01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:23,280
they're going to be people who either

01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:25,520
are from those communities in power

01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,560
or those who are trying to gain some

01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,560
type of power

01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,560
that are going to uplift some of these

01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:33,920
isms whether it's sexism

01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:36,159
racism homosexuality ableism

01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:37,679
uh there there's just a long list of

01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:40,080
things that we want to rid

01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:41,199
of this world but it's being uphold

01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:44,000
because

01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:45,360
the the way the system was designed is

01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,840
that these patterns

01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:49,440
and tendencies and behaviors are ones

01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:52,080
that are easy to fall back

01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:53,440
on if we don't take a moment to pause

01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:56,000
and ask questions

01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:57,119
and really think about the policies that

01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,760
we

01:52:57,119 --> 01:53:01,119
create or the environments that we work

01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:04,159
in

01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:05,679
and this is especially true when we look

01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:08,239
at how

01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:10,239
all of these behaviors and systems play

01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:13,360
out in tech

01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:15,440
because tech is just a microcosm of the

01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:17,280
bigger world that we live in

01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:20,320
i mean if we look at the globe as a

01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:22,560
whole the systems that are in place here

01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:24,080
can be replicated everywhere else in the

01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:26,719
world and we see it

01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:28,400
and we understand that but the one thing

01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:30,000
that is different and it makes it hard

01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:32,000
for some people to

01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,440
pinpoint these actions and see where

01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,760
they stem from

01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:37,199
is the fact that it manifests in

01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,639
different ways depending on the

01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:42,239
environment

01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:45,280
so how can we break this down in tech

01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:46,239
i recently have understood what site

01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:49,360
reliability

01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:50,639
engineering is uh but and i think it's

01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:54,080
funny because

01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:55,440
these theories and these structures are

01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:58,480
something that i've been using

01:53:55,440 --> 01:54:02,000
in my life just to understand and how

01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:03,840
understand how to fix day-to-day things

01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,400
but now that i understand and i have

01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:07,440
this vocabulary with site reliability

01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:11,199
engineering or

01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:11,760
sre i now understand how i can apply

01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:16,159
this to

01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:20,480
everyday life so i found this chart it

01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:23,440
mimics the milo's hierarchy of needs

01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:24,639
but in the sre realm so it starts off

01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:26,159
with monitoring

01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:28,480
these are the things that we put in

01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:30,719
place to see how an application is doing

01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:33,440
and if it ever goes down at any point

01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:34,239
and if it does go down we go and step up

01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:37,040
in the pyramid

01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:38,800
and we go into incident reporting

01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:42,080
depending on the issue that

01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:43,199
happens or arises it gets shoot it gets

01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:46,239
passed off to

01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:46,880
someone who can debug it and try to fix

01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:50,000
it

01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:51,280
and after that fix is in there we do a

01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:55,360
postmortem

01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:58,320
and from that post-mortem we are able to

01:54:55,360 --> 01:55:00,000
understand what the call root cause was

01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:02,000
and try to really

01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,920
take a moment to reflect on different

01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,199
things that we can do and tests that we

01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:07,360
can put in place

01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:08,480
to go ahead and make sure that going

01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:11,520
forward

01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:13,679
once we try to scale the application

01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,960
that we are planning to and making sure

01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:17,679
that we do not

01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,320
have those issues come back up and if

01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:21,199
they do

01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:23,199
we know how to handle them and so once

01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:25,760
you have that solid foundation

01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:26,239
you're able to build out and architect

01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:29,119
this

01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:31,599
amazing application with the front and

01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:33,119
back and databases and all that stuff

01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:35,119
and then you're able to take this to

01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:38,560
production and

01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:42,159
have it used by other people

01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:43,440
so i understand that in tech we have all

01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:45,679
these systems that

01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:47,599
we build out and we have all these

01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:49,840
policies and procedures

01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:51,599
that are built in to understand if it's

01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:55,040
working or and if it's not

01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:57,280
and we also know if and when we need to

01:55:55,040 --> 01:56:01,440
do things to make it better

01:55:57,280 --> 01:56:03,920
so why not use this same system to

01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:05,760
figure out what's not working in our

01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:08,080
cultures

01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,599
we need to use this system to debug the

01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:14,639
systems that are now

01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:18,080
being amplified in 2020.

01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:18,880
so using that thought process i decided

01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:21,199
to break down

01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:23,119
some of the things that i've noticed and

01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:23,840
witnessed in tech over the last few

01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:26,639
months

01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,239
and try to relate it back to the bigger

01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:30,000
systems at play

01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:32,000
and i started off with the lack of

01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,040
monitoring that is happening in the tech

01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,119
industry

01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:36,639
a lot of these companies we never know

01:56:35,119 --> 01:56:39,840
what's going wrong

01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:39,840
until it blows up

01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:45,440
some of the companies that i listed here

01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:48,480
like gatsby just a few days ago we had

01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:51,840
a contractor share their experience

01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:54,719
experience of working at gatsby and how

01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,480
negative it was and how um all of those

01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:59,199
systems at play

01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:02,000
came out in ways that create an

01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:04,639
environment that wasn't welcoming to

01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,000
a lot of people and it even came to

01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:06,960
light that some of the stuff that they

01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,920
were doing were

01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:10,960
was illegal and then we have companies

01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:14,480
like pinterest

01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:16,239
who recently over the years have been

01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:18,159
getting more and more recognition

01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:20,320
recognition for having

01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:21,520
features that highlight diversity and

01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:24,080
inclusion

01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:25,440
but we had three black women come out

01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:27,840
and say that they

01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:29,920
they felt like they were underpaid and

01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:32,880
they faced racist comments

01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:34,000
and when they spoke up about this and

01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:36,719
tried to

01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,080
get those things to change and to make

01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:40,000
sure that they weren't working in a

01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:43,199
hostile environment

01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,960
they were subject to retaliation

01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:47,679
because they were trying they raised

01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:50,000
those complaints

01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:51,040
and then you have lambda school it's a

01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,679
coding boot camp

01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:55,360
and in tech we know that boot camps are

01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:56,480
the center of a lot of controversial

01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:58,960
themes

01:57:56,480 --> 01:58:01,119
but there is one article that i recently

01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:04,639
came across about land the school

01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:06,800
that was news to me it was a former

01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:08,159
employee who was speaking out about the

01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,679
problems she saw

01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:11,599
with the way that they were handling

01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:13,679
diversity with their students

01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:15,599
and she also highlighted some of the

01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:18,800
ways that she experienced it

01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:21,440
experienced microaggressions and racism

01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:22,239
while working there and the company was

01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:24,080
actually coming

01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:27,599
after her and trying to sue her for

01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:27,599
speaking out about those things

01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:31,360
now if we look at the bigger system at

01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:33,360
play we see that

01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:35,040
the what's going on here is the control

01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:37,760
of power

01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:38,719
when you have these systems in play in

01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:40,960
order to

01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:42,960
keep your power and to stay on top you

01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:46,480
have to limit the access

01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:49,520
so that other people can't reach the top

01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:51,679
and take you down so there's no real way

01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:55,119
for us to do those reportings

01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:57,119
um and there's no real way for us to

01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:58,560
get a health check on these companies

01:58:57,119 --> 01:59:02,000
without it

01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:06,800
caught without some irreversible damage

01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,800
happening and we find out after the fact

01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:11,199
so one of the solutions i came up with

01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:12,560
is that we should start using

01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:15,280
self-reporting tools

01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:16,320
like good job good job helps keep the

01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:18,880
pulse on

01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:19,440
on organizational health through and

01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:22,000
it's

01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:24,639
and because it's a third party app it

01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,280
increases transparency and reduces bias

01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:28,239
because

01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:29,520
you're not questioning if the company

01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:31,840
changed the numbers

01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:32,639
to make them look good it's it's not

01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:35,199
their tool

01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:36,159
it's just the employees reporting how

01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:37,599
they feel

01:59:36,159 --> 01:59:39,840
and what the environment is actually

01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:39,840
like

01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:45,360
now we move on to ensigning reporting

01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:48,639
incidenting reporting

01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:50,239
is sometimes very unclear in these tech

01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:52,000
organizations

01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:54,000
it can be unclear because there is a

01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,520
lack of policies and you don't know who

01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,599
to talk to

01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:58,800
when something goes wrong or you don't

01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:01,840
even know what

01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:04,639
you can and can't or can and shouldn't

02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:06,560
report it's just no one really knows

02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:08,000
these things

02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:10,000
and then you have to deal with the fact

02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,920
that if you do report things

02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,599
you don't know if there's any checks and

02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:15,520
balances in place

02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:16,639
and so if you're reporting someone

02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:19,520
higher up

02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:21,440
you're not sure if anything bad will

02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:25,119
happen to you because you're reporting

02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:25,119
someone who has more power than you do

02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:32,159
so looking at the systems in place here

02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:35,040
again it's a power thing

02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:37,280
because the when you're doing the

02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:38,639
reporting and you're unsure of how the

02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:41,440
outcome will come

02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:42,560
there's an equality there so we want to

02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:45,840
be very careful

02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:48,400
when we report these things we sometimes

02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:50,239
don't report them because we know that

02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:54,239
we don't always have the power that

02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:57,119
we're looking for

02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:58,080
so some one solution that i came up with

02:00:57,119 --> 02:01:00,960
is that we need to

02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:03,840
create risk management systems that we

02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:07,679
can fall back on when things go wrong

02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:10,800
even in the realm of sre we know that

02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:13,040
we want to have uh i steps

02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:15,119
written out for incident reporting

02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:18,080
because when something goes down and

02:01:15,119 --> 02:01:20,239
and it's in production people's and

02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:22,159
anxiety is already high

02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:24,400
we don't want to just respond to things

02:01:22,159 --> 02:01:26,960
instantly in that state

02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:27,920
so instead we know that we need to

02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:30,960
manage these

02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:32,480
incidents effectively and to do that we

02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:35,520
need to have

02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:37,280
things listed out to reduce that anxiety

02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:40,080
and make sure that we are responding to

02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:40,080
things correctly

02:01:42,159 --> 02:01:46,159
and this moves us on to the post-mortem

02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:47,920
or

02:01:46,159 --> 02:01:50,639
this part was actually really difficult

02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:53,520
to break down and understand in the tech

02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:54,639
space because there's really no

02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:56,400
postmortem

02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:57,920
when something goes wrong and someone

02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:59,840
leaves the company

02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:01,840
the most i could really think about and

02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:05,280
can did some research about

02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:06,719
is they do an exit interview and during

02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:09,520
an accident interview

02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:10,400
at the hr department will ask you why

02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:13,280
you're leaving

02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:14,639
uh if anything bad happened and that was

02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:16,000
the cause of you wanting to leave the

02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:18,000
company

02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,639
now there's been countless studies that

02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:23,199
showed that most people leave companies

02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:25,280
because of their manager and not so much

02:02:23,199 --> 02:02:28,560
of the actual company

02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:31,119
but hr still asks you these questions

02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:32,480
but especially for marginalized

02:02:31,119 --> 02:02:35,119
individuals

02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:36,560
hr and employees don't have the best

02:02:35,119 --> 02:02:38,480
relationship

02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:40,480
i was told whenever i go through an

02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:43,119
ex-interview that i should

02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:45,119
not tell the truth because if there is a

02:02:43,119 --> 02:02:46,000
at any point i want to come back to the

02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:48,159
company

02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,360
it could be a liability for them to hire

02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:52,480
me again

02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:54,159
so it was never in my best interest to

02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:56,080
tell the truth

02:02:54,159 --> 02:03:01,599
so if this is the only postmortem we

02:02:56,080 --> 02:03:03,679
have is this really effective

02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:04,800
if we look at the systems the bigger

02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:07,280
systems at play

02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:09,040
it's power once again and i want to

02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:10,000
point out the fact that a lot of these

02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:12,560
systems

02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,599
are centered around power and the fact

02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:16,639
that

02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:19,840
one group of people are trying to

02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:20,719
hold all the power so at every at a

02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:23,280
number of different

02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:24,639
points you see them restricting access

02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:26,560
and opportunity

02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:27,760
and making sure that the policies that

02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:30,960
are putting out there

02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:30,960
are benefiting them

02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:37,119
so one solution that i came up with is

02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:40,320
that we can

02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:44,000
create clear policies uh

02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:46,560
i've said this already um in this slides

02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,000
and it's honestly one of the easiest

02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:51,119
ways to make change

02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,639
if we have clear policies and make sure

02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:56,079
that

02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:57,199
there we are reducing bias in racism and

02:03:56,079 --> 02:03:59,679
all of those things

02:03:57,199 --> 02:04:00,880
and all of the isms when we are making

02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:03,920
these policies

02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:06,159
we will increase retention rates

02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:07,280
just by making sure that we are doing

02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:10,560
these things

02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:11,840
and making sure that we are taking the

02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:15,360
time to really understand

02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:17,599
why people are leaving and taking that

02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:18,880
pause to reflect and find different ways

02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:21,920
that we can

02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:25,840
make things better and increase those

02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:25,840
retention rates

02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:29,920
the next part that we walk into is the

02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:32,400
testing

02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:35,840
this was another great area for me when

02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:38,480
understanding the tech industry at large

02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:40,159
and how it interacts with these systems

02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:44,480
the one thing that i did think of

02:04:40,159 --> 02:04:46,560
is the performance improvement plans

02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:48,159
these plans are given to employees who

02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:50,159
are falling behind

02:04:48,159 --> 02:04:51,520
they may not be hitting their mark and

02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:53,520
things like that

02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:55,440
and the employers are trying to work

02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:58,480
with them to get them back on track

02:04:55,440 --> 02:05:01,520
and to keep them as an employee

02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:04,480
but a lot of the times when i looked

02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:05,360
at the people who have been on a

02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:08,480
performance

02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:11,840
improvement plans or pips

02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:15,040
there was no real clear path as to what

02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:18,320
led them to get on these pip plans

02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:20,320
and when they got on the plans the goals

02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:22,639
and kpis that they had

02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:23,760
are key performance indicators that they

02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:26,079
had

02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,040
weren't that clear either so it seemed

02:05:26,079 --> 02:05:29,199
very vague

02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:30,079
and it didn't seem like it was anything

02:05:29,199 --> 02:05:33,280
that would be

02:05:30,079 --> 02:05:35,679
in the employee's favor instead it just

02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:38,719
seems like another way to prolong

02:05:35,679 --> 02:05:38,719
letting someone go

02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:45,040
so if we look at what systemic racism

02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,800
looks like

02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:49,520
it's just a reinforcement of all of

02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:53,760
these policies and practices

02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:55,440
that are based on stereotypes and biases

02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:57,599
and all of these different things but

02:05:55,440 --> 02:06:00,880
it's supported by policies

02:05:57,599 --> 02:06:03,920
and this would is this is what pip plans

02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:04,960
look like they look like because they're

02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:07,280
so vague

02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:09,280
they look like just another way to cover

02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:11,679
up all the isms

02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:14,400
and reasoning behind why someone is

02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:14,400
being let go

02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:21,920
so the solution here would be to create

02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,719
clear policies and when we create these

02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,159
policies

02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:27,440
and making sure that everyone

02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:29,599
understands what is expected of them

02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:31,840
while they are employees and even if

02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:35,119
they do go on a pip plan

02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:37,040
this will have an equitable impact

02:06:35,119 --> 02:06:39,360
on everyone it doesn't mean that

02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:40,159
everyone will keep their job or anything

02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:42,320
like that

02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:43,199
it just means that if you don't miss

02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:44,880
your mark

02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:46,800
or you don't hit your mark you'll

02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:50,480
understand what mark it is

02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:53,119
why you didn't didn't make it

02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:53,760
and it would be clear as to why you were

02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:58,320
let go

02:06:53,760 --> 02:07:01,520
if you are

02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:02,320
the next part is the compass uh capacity

02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:04,320
planning

02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:05,679
so this is where we start to scale and

02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:08,239
make things bigger

02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:09,360
um a lot of organizations scale really

02:07:08,239 --> 02:07:11,599
fast and

02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:13,119
things fall apart and they blame it on

02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:15,360
scaling

02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:17,040
if we look at lambda school we will see

02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:18,800
that example happening there

02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:20,079
they scaled really fast they were

02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:22,639
probably trying to

02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:24,400
hit their quotas and make sure their

02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:24,800
margins look good and things like that

02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:27,119
so

02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:28,480
they were trying to attract more and

02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:30,159
more students

02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:32,079
but they didn't really pay attention to

02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:34,320
the harm that they were causing by the

02:07:32,079 --> 02:07:36,560
different tactics that they used to

02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:37,920
get those students in a lot of the

02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:40,960
students that they attracted

02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:44,079
were mark from marginalized communities

02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:45,360
and lacked the funding that it took to

02:07:44,079 --> 02:07:47,920
go to lambda school

02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:49,119
so they took out these loans that were

02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:55,840
not set up to

02:07:49,119 --> 02:07:55,840
help anyone but the the banks

02:07:56,239 --> 02:08:00,880
so looking at this system it's important

02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:03,840
to understand that

02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:04,560
a lot of these scenes that are at play

02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:07,599
has

02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:08,000
to do with systemic racism and one of

02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:10,880
the key

02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,920
factors in systemic racism is ignoring

02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,239
the red flags

02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:15,440
and things that have happened in our

02:08:14,239 --> 02:08:18,000
history

02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:20,000
if you think about it when 2020 and

02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,480
everything started to happen

02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,400
they a lot of people kept saying i can't

02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:27,599
believe it it's 20 20.

02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:29,760
why is racism still a thing i can think

02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:31,599
back to when obama was president became

02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:34,719
president for the first time

02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:38,320
and he a lot of people are saying racism

02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:41,599
is going to end obama is president

02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:43,599
all the bad times in america are gone

02:08:41,599 --> 02:08:45,199
and or they would say like it was so

02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:47,119
long ago it doesn't matter and that's

02:08:45,199 --> 02:08:49,280
how he became president

02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:51,199
but if you look at any history book you

02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:52,320
don't have to flip back that many pages

02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:54,960
to see that

02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:56,800
racism and all of these other isms

02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:58,400
weren't that far back and the themes

02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:01,840
that we are referencing

02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:05,280
didn't happen that that long ago

02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:05,840
so what happens when when organizations

02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:08,320
scale

02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:10,400
and they don't take a time to pause and

02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:12,639
go back to the bottom of that

02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:13,599
pyramid and start over and make things

02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:16,320
better

02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:17,760
they're just repeating things and just

02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:21,520
doing it at scale

02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:21,520
and causing more and more harm

02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:26,000
so some of the solutions that we can

02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:27,920
have for this one is just

02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:30,400
stop trying to scale when your systems

02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:31,599
don't work if we just take a pause like

02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:34,000
i said and start

02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:34,639
back over at the bottom of that pyramid

02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,639
we can make

02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:38,480
improvements and it wouldn't take as

02:09:36,639 --> 02:09:41,119
long as most people would think

02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:42,239
and when you do scale you your margins

02:09:41,119 --> 02:09:43,679
will be higher

02:09:42,239 --> 02:09:45,280
because you've got it right and you

02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:48,639
don't have to go back

02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:48,639
and fix a lot of mistakes

02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:57,920
now the development part of this

02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:57,920
talk is very frustrating for me

02:09:58,239 --> 02:10:03,360
if we look at the hiring practices in

02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:06,560
tech we can all agree that they're awful

02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:09,280
just a few days ago i read this article

02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:11,280
that was titled people like you don't

02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:14,239
belong in big tech

02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:15,760
it came out from a blog written by aiden

02:10:14,239 --> 02:10:18,079
benjamin

02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:20,079
the title as i was reading the blog i

02:10:18,079 --> 02:10:21,760
realized the title was a response he

02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:23,920
received from an interviewer

02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:26,840
after he shared that he needed

02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:28,000
additional accommodations due to his

02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:30,800
disability

02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,920
the interviewer's response was people

02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:35,280
like you

02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:37,280
don't belong in tech

02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:39,440
the only solution that i would ever

02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:42,239
suggest for a situation like this

02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:44,639
is to fire that individual who said that

02:10:42,239 --> 02:10:46,880
because imagine if this person felt so

02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:49,599
confident to say that to someone

02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:50,800
what are they not saying out loud how

02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:54,239
many people

02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:57,119
did that person let go because of some

02:10:54,239 --> 02:10:58,639
ism that they believe in how many people

02:10:57,119 --> 02:11:00,719
did not get that raise that they

02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:02,719
deserted that promotion because

02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:04,159
that person wanted to hold on to their

02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:06,400
power

02:11:04,159 --> 02:11:09,119
it's themes in people like this who are

02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:11,840
in power and can create the policies

02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:14,639
that continue to build and support these

02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:17,599
systems that we are trying to work

02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:17,599
and get away from

02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:22,560
there is no doubt in my mind that the

02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:25,760
example that i'm showing

02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:30,239
here for the develop development section

02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:32,480
is intuition of intuitional racism

02:11:30,239 --> 02:11:33,440
because and i say this even though it's

02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:37,840
related to

02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:42,320
ableism what we're seeing in

02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:44,480
when people are playing out and

02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:45,599
having these tendencies and patterns

02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:48,639
that

02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:50,000
promote ableism is directly related to

02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:53,199
racism

02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:56,400
you can't have one without the other

02:11:53,199 --> 02:11:59,599
racism and ableism is just a tool to

02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:02,719
put barriers on people so by

02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:05,679
eradicating one by eradicating

02:12:02,719 --> 02:12:06,880
racism we're that much much closer to

02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:09,520
eradicating

02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:09,520
ableism

02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:15,760
so now we've gone through this pyramid

02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:18,079
and if we don't do it right

02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:19,520
we will get to the production stage and

02:12:18,079 --> 02:12:22,880
we'll build things

02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:25,679
like the facial recognition

02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:28,159
that doesn't pick up darker skin tones

02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:30,800
are different gender expressions

02:12:28,159 --> 02:12:31,199
um and all of the facial recognitions

02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:33,920
that

02:12:31,199 --> 02:12:34,800
doesn't work it's usually built off of

02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:37,119
data

02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:38,000
and um the machine learning is using

02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:41,280
data

02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,480
that isn't clean like it isn't good data

02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:46,719
it's full of bias

02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:49,360
it's full of racism ableism all the isms

02:12:46,719 --> 02:12:52,560
but it got to the production stage and

02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:55,920
it's out there and it's causing harm

02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:58,159
another example of um

02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,199
tech that gets to the production stage

02:12:58,159 --> 02:13:02,239
that

02:12:59,199 --> 02:13:05,679
has all the bad things baked into it

02:13:02,239 --> 02:13:08,239
is the face but facebook ad algorithm

02:13:05,679 --> 02:13:09,360
this is something i recently had to

02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:12,719
interact with

02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:14,639
i was doing a mental health event for uh

02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:16,159
tech by choice and it was focused on our

02:13:14,639 --> 02:13:18,400
black members

02:13:16,159 --> 02:13:20,360
and so i was trying to run an ad that

02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:23,199
had black community and

02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:25,280
self-preservation the ad was rejected

02:13:23,199 --> 02:13:26,800
multiple times because it was flagged as

02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:30,159
a social justice

02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:33,520
issue black mental health

02:13:30,159 --> 02:13:37,520
is a social justice issue

02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:37,520
when facebook looks at it

02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:44,719
we see that power again is at play with

02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:47,599
some of the issues that we see when

02:13:44,719 --> 02:13:50,400
bad code gets to production or bad

02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:54,000
algorithms are out there

02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:56,400
but i want to make a key

02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,760
point here that the power that i'm

02:13:56,400 --> 02:14:00,480
talking about here

02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:01,920
it's not so much someone's trying to

02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:04,480
hold things back

02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:06,000
but instead people are holding back

02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:08,560
individuals from being

02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:12,159
in positions of power to make a change

02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:14,320
and to make a difference

02:14:12,159 --> 02:14:15,840
so the solution that i came up for this

02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:18,000
issue is to go ahead

02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:19,920
and make sure that we're creating

02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,400
environments that will allow more people

02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:23,679
to

02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:24,159
enter the space and have positions of

02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:26,400
power

02:14:24,159 --> 02:14:27,280
where they can create policies and

02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,880
change

02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:30,400
and but we want to make sure that they

02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:34,079
feel empowered enough

02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:34,079
to challenge the status quo

02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:41,760
so through these stats we can see that

02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:45,760
tech is really just a microcosm of the

02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:45,760
world the larger world that we live in

02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:51,679
but the good thing about that is we can

02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:53,440
change it for the better

02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:56,239
and tech how many people do you know

02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:58,320
that takes takes home

02:14:56,239 --> 02:15:00,159
tech with them there are a number of

02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:03,599
people i know that use a

02:15:00,159 --> 02:15:05,280
agile methodology to plan out grocery

02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:08,159
shopping and events

02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:09,840
that they have for fun we can use this

02:15:08,159 --> 02:15:12,000
logical thinking to

02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:13,920
be able to identify the thoughtless

02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,400
tendencies and behaviors

02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:18,719
that tend to come up from these systems

02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:23,840
that were designed to make sure

02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:23,840
certain groups do not succeed

02:15:24,719 --> 02:15:28,000
and i know i said a lot of negative

02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:29,920
things about tech

02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:32,320
but i do want to point out the fact that

02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:36,239
tech is starting to change

02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:38,480
it's just slow af

02:15:36,239 --> 02:15:40,960
and when i think about this i think it's

02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:42,960
very odd that as a community and as an

02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:43,599
industry we can build these amazing

02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:46,639
products

02:15:43,599 --> 02:15:50,560
that can scale very quickly but

02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:52,719
we can't get human interaction right

02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:54,880
it's something to think about and it's

02:15:52,719 --> 02:15:58,159
something that we can change

02:15:54,880 --> 02:16:01,119
how fast and how effective the change is

02:15:58,159 --> 02:16:01,119
all depends on us

02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:05,040
so i've come to the end of my talk and i

02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:07,280
just want to say thank you

02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:08,480
for listening to me talk about these

02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:10,960
systems and

02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:12,719
finding different ways that we can

02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,800
pinpoint the different behaviors and

02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:16,159
tendencies so we can make the change we

02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:18,719
want to see

02:16:16,159 --> 02:16:20,480
just a quick shout out tech by choice is

02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:22,800
trying to change the system

02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:24,079
for minority-owned businesses by running

02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:26,800
a hackathon

02:16:24,079 --> 02:16:28,239
to help take these business owners into

02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:29,199
the digital space and make sure that

02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:32,479
they thrive

02:16:29,199 --> 02:16:34,639
if you want to be a part of this change

02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:38,479
uh go ahead and check out our events

02:16:34,639 --> 02:16:41,599
website and see how you can get involved

02:16:38,479 --> 02:16:41,599
and that's it

02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:46,000
all right thank you so much valerie that

02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:48,719
was great i loved all

02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:49,679
of the stuff you had and there's so many

02:16:48,719 --> 02:16:51,200
helpful slides

02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:53,200
uh one of the things i find almost

02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:55,760
ironic is tech

02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:57,679
is almost always this like move fast

02:16:55,760 --> 02:17:00,559
break things sort of mentality

02:16:57,679 --> 02:17:01,280
and yet uh you know you just mentioned

02:17:00,559 --> 02:17:02,800
tech

02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:04,960
in terms of at least these kinds of

02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:08,319
systems is just slow

02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:10,639
incredibly slow and it's incredibly

02:17:08,319 --> 02:17:13,599
ironic i think just in general

02:17:10,639 --> 02:17:16,000
um how somebody had wondered how do we

02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:18,000
keep feedback from becoming entangled

02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:21,359
with performance focused activities like

02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,359
reviews or okrs

02:17:21,599 --> 02:17:26,960
um can you repeat the question

02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:28,479
yeah i think i'm a little bittery even

02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:30,319
though it's like i'm talking to my

02:17:28,479 --> 02:17:32,960
computer

02:17:30,319 --> 02:17:33,920
that's fine um how do we keep feedback

02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:36,000
from becoming

02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:37,280
entangled in performance focused

02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,920
activities

02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:40,639
like uh you know reviews from managers

02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:44,080
or

02:17:40,639 --> 02:17:48,160
um okrs or other things like that

02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:50,559
um yeah i think if we i think

02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:51,760
organizations that only hold feedback

02:17:50,559 --> 02:17:54,160
for reviews

02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:54,880
are not good good organizations like you

02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:56,960
need to have

02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:58,800
constant feedback to get the better

02:17:56,960 --> 02:18:01,200
reviews and to improve

02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:03,359
like your skill set and things like that

02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:03,359
so

02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:08,240
i think if if the system was set up that

02:18:06,319 --> 02:18:09,840
way so it's just constant feedback

02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:11,439
constant communication about what's

02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:15,120
working what's not working

02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:18,719
there wouldn't be any room to tie it to

02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:19,280
uh kpis um and i think there are

02:18:18,719 --> 02:18:21,920
different

02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:24,160
ways that we can talk about improvements

02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:27,679
and not tie it to metrics

02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:29,120
um and i think that's one of the

02:18:27,679 --> 02:18:32,080
trickier parts

02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:34,319
um just in tech in general we don't do a

02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:37,599
good job at tracking

02:18:34,319 --> 02:18:41,120
non-like code related tasks

02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:42,800
i don't think we do a good job at that

02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:44,639
it's also interesting because we're so

02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:46,559
much into collecting all this data but

02:18:44,639 --> 02:18:50,800
yeah we almost don't have data on our

02:18:46,559 --> 02:18:50,800
own practices like this

02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:56,080
um somebody had wondered if you had

02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:57,840
any thoughts on how to scale down

02:18:56,080 --> 02:19:01,599
systems that don't work

02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:03,920
um and how to insist on perpetuating and

02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:06,399
lifting people up

02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:08,639
yeah i've noticed that in most

02:19:06,399 --> 02:19:12,080
organizations there's one little

02:19:08,639 --> 02:19:14,399
part of a org that gets it right um and

02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:16,319
something that i was recently told is

02:19:14,399 --> 02:19:17,519
that when you do have a part of your art

02:19:16,319 --> 02:19:21,120
that's getting it right

02:19:17,519 --> 02:19:23,599
what you want to do is slowly add

02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:24,960
individuals from other groups that are

02:19:23,599 --> 02:19:27,359
getting it wrong

02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:29,359
add them to the good team let them get

02:19:27,359 --> 02:19:31,840
used to those practices and the way

02:19:29,359 --> 02:19:32,880
things work there and then they will

02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:36,319
instinctively

02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:37,439
take that back to any group or any team

02:19:36,319 --> 02:19:41,040
that they work with

02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:42,719
so if we can do that um it takes time

02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:44,160
that i don't think you can speed that

02:19:42,719 --> 02:19:47,599
one up so it

02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:50,880
is going to be slow as af wait

02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:52,319
don't say bad words um so that's fine

02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:53,120
but that's something that we would want

02:19:52,319 --> 02:19:56,960
to do

02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:59,920
at a slower pace all right

02:19:56,960 --> 02:20:01,920
um i think we're about out of time so

02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:03,120
thank you valerie again for your great

02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:05,200
insightful talk

02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:06,160
this brings us to the end of artifacts

02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:07,600
day two

02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:09,280
again we're really glad you could join

02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:10,800
us for discussions on mental health

02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:12,160
community building and all other

02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:12,560
important things we should be talking

02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:15,200
about

02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:17,280
in this upper community we've had three

02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:19,600
more wonderful speakers tonight

02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:21,600
tori jamie and valerie they all did a

02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:21,840
great job but also shared with us a lot

02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:24,240
of

02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:26,000
good insights remember you can continue

02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:26,720
these conversations after the stream

02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,800
ends

02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:30,319
our slack stays open 24 7 so you can

02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:32,000
head over the conversations in our
