It's 2020. We know that burnout is real, self-care is important, and “rockstar” techies are at least cryptids, if not outright myths. Right?

I'm a recovering rockstar. It wasn't enough for me to make a career change and transition into tech, I had to /win/ at it. On top of my full-time job, I taught, spoke, networked, organized, tweeted, blogged, appeared on TV... “no” wasn't in my vocabulary.

Turns out there's only so long I can keep up that sort of behavior without developing problematic mental health issues and wrecking my relationships (oops!). In this session, I'll talk through learning how to accept my limitations, to recognize burnout and be kind to myself, and to responsibly re-engage after taking a self-care break. I've made the mistakes so you don't have to!

okay i'm very kind of high strung and

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,040
that issue of my personality is kind of

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
going to be brought to the forefront

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,319
in this story um the other thing you

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,360
need to realize about me

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,800
i am divorced um don't be sorry for me

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,480
it was a good thing

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
and as a consequence of the divorce i

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,879
ended up moving back in with my parents

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,720
um i was having a hard time finding

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
employment i was working at a minimum

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,120
wage

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,879
part-time jobs struggling to make ends

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,040
meet whole thing

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,040
and i had to switch careers and move

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,800
into the tech sphere very very quickly

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,159
in order to do that i went to a

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,040
programming boot camp

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,800
and i mean the good news is that it came

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,400
pretty naturally to me

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,080
but the bad news was i looked around and

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,239
i was like well

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,159
i'm competing with these 20 other people

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,560
who are in this bootcamp for jobs and

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,200
all of

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,040
us we're competing with people out there

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,239
who have computer science degrees we're

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,440
competing with people who have

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,720
experience

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,799
so i busted my butt

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,400
to get through boot camp i did extra

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,640
work i did side projects i started

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
networking i started going to meetups

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,680
i had interviews lined up before the

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,200
program ended i mean i

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,560
i worked and as an end result of that

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,400
work

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
i did almost immediately out of the boot

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,480
camp land a job at highland software

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
which is one of northeast ohio's biggest

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,560
and most well-known tech companies

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
so it worked out for me but i'm about to

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,000
share

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
the the costs involved in having that

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,599
work out so well for me

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,000
i've become kind of good friends with

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,840
the woman who ran the boot camp

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,519
and as i was in it was a brand new

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,120
program um

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,799
i was in kind of her first professional

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
cohort she called me up and she said you

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,000
know i have the news here

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
and if they want to interview someone

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
who went to the program would you come

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
in and

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,359
talk to them so i said yeah sure why not

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,359
and i ended up on the news

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,560
so i was on the tv and i was kind of in

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,080
this news article and

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,759
i had a really good response i started

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,800
going to some meetings um

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,120
with the boot camp i was kind of their

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,520
recruitment person they had me you know

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,160
tried it out as a success story a lot

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,360
and then they wanted to do a commercial

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,800
and

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,800
when they got me to do the commercial i

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,080
mean they can't even say tori you're a

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,919
rock star

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
and i was like no i hate the word

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,680
rockstar that is an omen that is a bad

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,360
omen like no no

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,199
and this commercial keeps me up at night

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
it haunts my dreams because i literally

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,240
say the word rockstar in the commercial

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,080
they asked me to and i still think about

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,680
it and i don't like it and you can find

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,400
this on youtube but please don't

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,880
because it is tremendously embarrassing

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
um

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
but since i was already i was getting

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,680
involved in tech community through the

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,400
boot camp and i was working at highland

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,840
highland is really um into tech outreach

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,759
and community outreach and so they

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,720
started asking me to do things

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,400
and this is the slide at which i mean i

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
need to skip over this because i was

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,639
losing

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,320
so much time to paying attention to the

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,000
slide and trying to tell you all how

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,120
busy i was

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,280
when i started my career um all you need

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
to know really is that 2018

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,880
was a terrible year because i was

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
overbooked i was double booked for

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,280
things i could not say no to things

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,880
i would go to work and just i would work

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,360
and do things outside of work and stay

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,360
at work and go back to work and it was

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,440
so much work and it wasn't even my day

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,199
job it was everything surrounding my day

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,360
job and i had to be

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
you know i had a romantic romantic

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,319
partner i had a kid

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,840
i had pets like i'm doing all this on

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,280
top of my life

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,880
and it was just it was it was a lot

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,039
it was so much but i didn't feel like

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,720
it was burning me out because i was just

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,960
stressed right

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,479
like just because i'm doing a whole lot

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,479
of things it doesn't mean that i'm

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,720
suffering from burnout i'm just really

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,759
busy

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,919
we saw yesterday in the first talk that

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,919
the world health organization says that

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,600
burnout is workplace stress that has not

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,199
been successfully managed

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,120
well i didn't i didn't have workplace

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,039
stress my day job was fine

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,919
i would go into the office sit down

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,639
program the computer and my day job was

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,800
great it was all things i was doing in

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,960
addition to my day job

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,160
that was causing me so much stress and

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,680
anxiety and

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,680
causing me to feel bad which is why

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,520
i really like this quote that i found

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,440
from elena marini

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,120
who define burnout as a combination of

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,319
the nature of your work environment

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,199
and what it demands of you but also your

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,080
relationship

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,759
to your work and what happened with me

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,479
is that my relationship to my work was

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,880
no longer healthy because i had made

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,880
so much more work for myself i convinced

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,720
myself that in order to be successful

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,560
i not only had to do my day job but i

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,319
had to do all these other things on top

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,199
of it and keep putting myself out there

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,440
and keep

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,680
just going and going and going and

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,639
always saying yes because that was how i

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,960
was going to be

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,000
a success and at that point you begin to

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,400
ask yourself

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,759
well am i really just stressing because

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,759
i have a lot going on

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,520
or am i burning out and at that point i

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,720
kept telling myself that i was just a

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
little stressed

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,960
but the truth was that i felt like

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,319
absolute garbage

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,319
all the time because being in

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,599
this constant state of stress and

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,199
anxiety and go

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,800
go go makes us physically ill

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,720
i would wake up in the morning to go to

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,080
work and it was

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,000
it was so hard to drink myself out of

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,599
bed and to go to the office because

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,199
i was so certain that it was going to be

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,280
another bad day

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,639
when you're burnt out it's it's every

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,479
day is a bad day you don't have the

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
motivation to try and make it a good day

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,039
anymore you just you don't have the

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
energy

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,800
you go to work and you procrastinate you

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
put things off because you don't want to

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,840
do them and then you have to do

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,440
everything all at once because you left

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,120
it into the very last minute

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,720
and then there's some small uptick in

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,319
success in getting it done

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
but it's not done right and it's not

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,880
done well because you don't

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,560
care anymore and after

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,080
it keeps going on and going on and going

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,000
on you're so busy

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,080
i suffer from migraines and my migraines

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,200
went to chronic migraine i

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,920
always had some sort of event just

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,880
threatening right around here to happen

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,160
um

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,519
i horn a fitbit since 2016.

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,680
so i have i have the data on this and

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
my cardiovascular health tanked i mean

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,920
we learned in yesterday's talk about its

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,160
effects on your blood pressure

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,160
and your heart rate and by the time that

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,279
i finally got help for all of this my

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,320
resting heart rate averaged at 90

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,000
which for my size and my age is

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
extremely high

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,200
any sort of physical activity i did

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
would just send my full skyrocketing

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
until i felt like i was going to pass

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,880
out

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,560
and you know i'm thinking about this and

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,200
i'm wondering

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,480
why was i doing this to myself like what

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,519
was the pursuit

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,839
of work and work and more work

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,240
you know what i kept saying yes even

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,240
though i knew that

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,240
it wasn't good for me anymore

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,600
these are some photos i want to share

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,000
with you guys um

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,680
it's fun little game called the selfie

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,160
that i send to my girlfriends in the

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,760
group chat when i'm feeling like trash

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,440
and the photo that i post on social

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,000
media

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,120
so this one is from 2018 it's from one

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
of the highland women in tech

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
conferences that i was organizing

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,839
um the bathroom selfie is obviously

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,040
right before i went out and started the

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,320
conference and you could be forgiven for

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,800
thinking that the other

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,880
selfie with the tremendous bags under my

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,640
eyes is after i got home and i was tired

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,120
from running a conference

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,000
and instead it's the other way around

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,120
that sophie

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,720
is me being like i'm gonna run late

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
because i need to put on 20 pounds of

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,959
makeup in order to hide what's going on

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,959
right here

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,079
here's another one the caption on this

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,320
one was i haven't slept for two days lol

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,160
meanwhile compare contrast with the

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,839
president of my high school giving me a

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,040
young alumni award

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,480
for you know all the things i do to

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,640
promote women in tech

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,800
because i'm so busy that i'm batting on

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,399
the inside which i feel like

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,200
comes across a little on my face there

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,560
but hopefully no one else can tell

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,839
the most telling one though this is me

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
on my way home from a speaking

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,760
engagement

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,279
versus the selfie i sent to my friend

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,200
asking her

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,680
to bring the box of kleenex from her

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,360
desk to the highland ladies room

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,279
because i had to stress cry in the

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,800
bathroom and i'd run out of toilet paper

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,680
but someone else was in there so i

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,160
didn't want to leave the stall

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,560
like if you are stressed crying at work

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,640
you probably have a problem

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,920
like it's you shouldn't be stressed

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,279
crying at work i mean

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,880
i think we've all cried at work at least

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,800
once but it shouldn't be an ongoing

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,040
occurrence

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,240
and this this kept going and i kept

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,880
putting work on myself

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,079
this is from codemash in 2019 so this is

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,200
this is january

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,800
of 2019. and so at this point i've been

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,160
running myself ragged for

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,640
over a year and

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,279
you can tell if you look at the bathroom

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,720
hotel

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,800
selfie the end of my ponytail looks kind

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,360
of gross my hair is a little scraggly

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,959
if you look up where my heart is it's a

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,079
little thin

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,639
and that's because the fatigue

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,000
and the health effects of the burnout

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,880
and everything were getting to the point

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,120
where my hair was falling out

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,959
if you look at my social media selfie i

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,800
have a lot of product in my hair

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,560
i'm making a weird face so you can't

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,399
tell how tired i am

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,079
and my hair is very carefully parted in

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,200
a way that hides

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:24,240
where my actual like natural part is

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,800
because my hair situation was getting

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,440
kind of

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,440
kind of iffy

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,279
finally in april i ended up at the

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,200
doctor

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,440
um this is actually for my birthday my

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,320
33rd birthday present to myself was a

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,240
trip to the doctor to explain that i

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,639
couldn't keep doing what i was doing and

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,399
i needed to know if there was something

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,920
actually physically wrong with me um

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,000
and i was expecting just you know a

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,519
brief examination and for her to tell me

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,519
that i needed

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,760
to maybe cut some things out of my

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,600
schedule and meditate a little and drink

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,320
water and i would be fine

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,440
and instead she ordered seven different

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,240
blood tests

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,760
did a physical and told me that we

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,079
needed to find what was causing my

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,920
health

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,079
issues because it couldn't keep going

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,200
this way which was

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,160
a wake-up call i mean we did find out

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,839
that i had a low-grade non-anemic iron

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,079
deficiency that would help

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,600
explain some of the symptoms it was

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,920
probably why i was so

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,360
so tired and inspired i looked so tired

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,320
and i probably had a lot to do with my

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,800
hair

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,000
but aside from those health effects it

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,079
wouldn't explain

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,920
the total package and i definitely did

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,240
need to stop running myself ragged all

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,240
the time

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,560
so i had to ask myself why am i doing

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,760
this because it's not just about money

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,880
anymore it's not about

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,959
furthering my career at this point it

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,680
may have started that way

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,519
but that's not what it was at all

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,120
because as soon as i stopped moving as

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,079
soon as i tried to relax

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
i would become so keyed up i get so much

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,560
anxiety

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,639
and feel like i wasn't being productive

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,800
and i wasn't working and i needed

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,920
to be doing more and i needed to be

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,760
starting things

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,120
and you know people would miss me if i

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
disappeared and what if i don't get

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,360
enough likes on twitter

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,279
and i learned that

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,839
your brain actually can become

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,600
addicted to productivity in the same way

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,199
that it can be addicted to alcohol it

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,920
can be addictive substances it can be

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,199
addicted to

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,959
other kind of destructive behaviors

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:32,720
the front part of our brain changes

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:35,920
physically we rewire ourselves to be

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,440
in pursuit of this of the high of this

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,839
this feeling

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,720
that we get and that's that front part

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,959
of our brain

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,399
right up here that's where our executive

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,040
functioning lives so in the same way

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,800
that

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,279
someone with adhd for example their

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,040
executive function is

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,360
influenced in a way that you know it

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,680
causes problems with attention and focus

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,320
and impulsive behavior

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,800
when you have a problem with addiction

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,839
your

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,399
executive function is so tuned in to

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,560
pursuing that reward

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,680
that you let the rest of your life just

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,199
fall apart

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,000
the only thing that matters is

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,600
satisfying the reward system your brain

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
which is so fine-tuned with this one

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,240
thing

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,399
so this is your content warning part

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,760
like if you need to drop off

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,760
i understand um

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,199
so for me that feeling of anxiety that i

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,519
would get when i felt like

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,360
i would try to relax but it would feel

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,759
bad and i would get

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,240
so nervous and i just i didn't know what

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,959
to do with myself

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,800
was very reminiscent of the feeling that

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,880
i would get

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,120
about 10 years ago when my pill bottle

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,600
was empty

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,440
so i have not touched a benzodiazepine

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,320
in over 10 years

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,079
like i'm good with that i am what the

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,320
cool kids now follow in remission

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,920
which is when you have been in active

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,040
recovery from your addiction

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,920
for over five years but for me the word

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,399
recovery

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,240
is an ongoing process it's something

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,920
that promises us that we're going to get

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,120
better it's something that i think about

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,480
often maybe not every day anymore but i

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,160
consider it to be

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,639
something that i'm always putting into

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,320
practice and so if we can recover from

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,720
other forms of addiction and if we can

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,240
recover from mental health issues

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,880
at least to a certain extent we can

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,720
recover from burning ourselves

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,320
out and becoming addicted to work in

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,240
this idea that we need to be productive

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,279
and we need to be successful

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,399
the question is how do we do that or at

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,240
least

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,560
how did i do that and if you're

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,920
suffering from the same kind of things

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,920
maybe some of these can help you

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,680
it's a pop culture reference by now that

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,360
step one is admitting you have a problem

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,000
which obviously with my trip to the

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,120
doctor i realized that something hadn't

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,720
changed

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,320
even if you've never been in a 12-step

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,920
program you've never read a big book in

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,279
your life you're probably familiar with

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,800
that saying

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,639
and now that i've identified the root

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,680
cause of my problem

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,439
that i had to keep working because i'd

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,439
rewired my brain that way

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,280
it was time to take some steps to undo

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,120
the damage

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,039
the first thing was i had to tackle all

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,199
the things i'd let go in my lifestyle

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,880
that enabled me to just keep saying

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,120
yes to things and over booking my

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,160
calendar i mean after all

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,640
it's you know in order to recover from

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,400
my benson addiction i had to stop taking

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,240
benzos it's like

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080
you know you can't keep doing the same

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,559
lifestyle things you can follow

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,799
all the slides that come after this but

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,520
if you don't change your lifestyle

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,360
nothing else changes what i had to learn

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,280
is how to manage expectations around my

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,000
time with my expectations and other

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,000
people's

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,880
expectations and i learned

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,840
five magic words to doing that and they

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,679
are let me

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,640
check my schedule it's not a yes

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,160
it's not a no it's when someone asks you

00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,520
to do something let me check my schedule

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,919
and it gives you that little break to be

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,640
like do i really want to do this

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,120
can i can i book this i can i can look

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,120
this up

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,200
and actually see if i'm overbooked and

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,400
then i can make a decision

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
and i thought that people don't really

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,080
push back once you say no he's like oh

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,600
no i'm sorry i'm so busy i'd love to

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,000
help you but i can't

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,280
i haven't had someone push back on that

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,559
so it's a good way to say

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,360
no without being like hard no and along

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,960
with that

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,960
it's let me cut down my schedule of

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,000
things that i actually really want to do

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,400
and things i'm actually

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,520
really passionate about the other thing

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,000
that i learned is that i need to

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,720
delegate my responsibilities better

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,480
if i'm in an event like i'll fill a

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,480
leadership vacuum all day long but i

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,840
can't micromanage i can't be responsible

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,840
for

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,440
everything i need to trust other people

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,640
to do things for me

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,760
even though it was like writing this

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,480
talk i sent my partner out to get dinner

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,880
because i can't sit down write a talk

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,000
and

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,160
cook dinner and it's just those small

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
small steps small things that you can do

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,120
to just free up your schedule and learn

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
to let go a little bit

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,039
the other thing that i had to take care

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,679
of was my physical health which

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,559
as evidenced by my trip to the doctor

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,760
suffered

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:17,280
a lot the first thing

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,240
was i bought this water bottle i was

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,679
drinking literally pots of coffee a day

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,480
in an effort to both

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,160
stay awake and be interesting and

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,240
because i just really like coffee and i

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,799
let it get totally out of hand

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,320
um i hate drinking water but i make sure

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,520
that i fill this up at least once a day

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,880
and drink the entire thing

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,559
i realize that you're supposed to drink

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,080
like two of these but i really really

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,840
hate water

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,880
and honestly even though the half amount

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,640
of water

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,200
big difference in health the other thing

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,240
for me was my sleep hygiene again with

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,760
the fitbit

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,520
if you have a fitbit with a heart rate

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,039
monitor in it it will actually

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,480
track how you sleep and give you the

00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:01,600
sleep score my sleep score was abysmal

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,159
um i've raised it about 30 points

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,280
since beginning my my whole wellness

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,280
makeover

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,559
and even just taking my electronics and

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,600
taking my work things

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,520
out of the bedroom not working until i

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,000
absolutely had to fall asleep

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,440
not you know just pushing myself and

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,720
pushing myself and then expecting myself

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,120
to fall asleep

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,799
immediately getting some nice pajamas

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,640
getting some nice pillows taking a

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,000
little work break before i try going to

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,760
bed these are

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,240
tiny things that make a really big

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,960
difference because giving your body that

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,679
chance to

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,120
rest and reset is so vitally important

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,039
and this is from someone

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,960
who i mean years and years ago also had

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,440
insomnia problems

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,280
like i love sleep i just i don't know

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,080
what i'm gonna do if i have insomnia

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,159
again because it's

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,679
it's i love sleep sleep is my new

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,039
favorite thing it's like i've just

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,559
discovered it it's i'm

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,720
completely in love um

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,320
i have the obligatory endorphins make

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,559
you happy on here

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
um getting a workout is always good for

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,679
you getting your heart rate up a little

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,039
even your fingers taking a short walk

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,960
but i'm trying to stay away from things

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,880
that like you can google and google can

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,880
tell them to do better than i can

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,440
i do want to talk about releasing

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,440
pressure and releasing anxiety and

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,679
dealing with it in a healthy way

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,280
um that frustration and that that

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,720
feeling that i had when i'm so keyed up

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,200
and i didn't feel like i was being

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,520
productive that i needed to do something

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,520
um those feelings when we're when we're

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,480
trying to change our lives and when

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,640
we're trying to come

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,880
back from something that's very

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,559
negatively affected our health

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,640
we can have a lot of anger we can have a

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,600
lot of frustration in dealing with that

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,760
we need to

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,200
release those feelings in ways that are

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,679
not harmful to others and they're not

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,120
humble to ourselves

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,200
when you're suffering from something

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,840
like burnout it's really easy to start

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,720
self-medicating it's really easy to go

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,240
and start

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,840
you know having a glass of wine every

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
night that turns into two that turns

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,640
into

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,480
three that turns into a bottle it's

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,720
really easy to have

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,880
it's easy to have another problem in

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,720
addition to your burnout

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,480
so it's very important to find a way to

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,280
release those feelings in ways that

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,760
aren't harmful

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,280
especially things like anger because i

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,440
know i had a lot of

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,000
anger towards myself and it's this

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,080
feeling of i mean almost shame

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,600
that you let things get so bad and you

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,520
should have known better and you kind of

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,360
turned that inward

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,880
the best advice and this is going to

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,280
sound so stupid but i love showing

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,440
people i once had a therapist tell me go

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,200
out and buy a newspaper

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,120
and the whole point of the newspaper was

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,280
that next time i was just absolutely

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,799
furious at myself and i just wanted to

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,039
punch something or just

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,600
you know to take it out somehow i would

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,200
get the newspaper and just rip it shreds

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,520
and let me tell you when you are

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,720
absolutely just so angry at the world

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,799
taking it out on

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,760
this shreddable paper is really

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,080
satisfying

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,600
it sounds silly but it's absolutely true

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,679
um the other things i wanted to talk

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,039
about i want to talk about journaling

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,280
because everyone tells you to hit the

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,840
gym i'm bad at

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,720
journaling i know that it's good for me

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,320
and it's a mindfulness practice but i

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,159
am so bad at keeping up a journal

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,240
i will write about my feelings for like

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,480
three days max and then forget the thing

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,559
exists

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,320
i tricked myself into journaling by

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,400
writing down what i have for dinner

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,240
every night because i am very

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,600
highly food motivated i love food

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,280
so if i write down what i have for

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,120
dinner every night because i won't skip

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,240
dinner so i won't skip writing down what

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,760
i had for dinner

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,120
i find that i'm already journaling i'm

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,400
already writing i've already writing

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,080
down my dinner

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,679
so i might as well write down how i'm

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,919
feeling and then i start thinking about

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,760
it

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,440
and then congratulations now i'm

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,559
journaling for real instead of just

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,559
writing venue plans

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,840
two more slides

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,919
this this was also one of my big ones

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,600
and it was doing things that are

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,679
the opposite of work

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,520
um dedicated time in my schedule

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,000
scheduling blocks of non-productive

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
activity

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,400
and i have to define non-productive

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,840
activity these are things that do not

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,000
produce a product

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,200
like there's no end the thing that you

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,120
end up with

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,480
and they do not help you accomplish any

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,559
sort of goal

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,720
this is just mindless this is sitting on

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,720
the couch binging netflix

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,279
and not binging a documentary you're not

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,039
learning this is brain candy time

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,559
this is on your phone playing candy

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,919
crush until you use

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,320
until your phone just dies because

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,520
you've lost track of time time

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,279
um things like going and taking a walk

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,039
but a slow aimless walk

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,880
i define this as the difference between

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,679
me i'm a hiker

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,200
so i i'm walking is my hobby it's the

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,720
difference between me

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,640
taking an ambling walk through my

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,480
neighborhood and me

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,919
strapping on a pack driving to the park

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,640
and hiking for 10 miles

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,320
one of those has a goal the other one is

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,799
non-productive time

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,360
and at first this was tremendously hard

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,000
this was i had to force myself

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,880
to turn off and do something that didn't

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,320
matter but i

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,320
it gets easier the more you do it

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,840
last slide oh there's three more signs

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,720
but this is really the last important

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,279
slide

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,720
um i don't have a social support again

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,320
these are things that you can google and

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,960
google can tell you them better than i

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
can

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,559
but i do want to talk about employee

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,960
assistance programs um

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,880
they are usually offered they're offered

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,840
by a lot of employers and they can not

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,840
only provide

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,279
mental health and counseling services

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,360
often for free

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,120
um a lot of them i've seen employees get

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,720
you know x number of therapy visits on

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,240
the employee assistance programs that

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,840
they don't have to pay for

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,679
but if you're having any sort of other

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,400
structure in your life they can provide

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,080
often legal assistance um financial

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,760
advice things like that so just

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,600
your employer is already paying for it

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,480
if it's an offering to you please take

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,360
advantage of it in general

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,880
also therapy i love therapy i am

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,960
currently a therapy graduate but would

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,640
go back in a heartbeat i think everyone

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,720
should have a therapist before they need

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,880
one just in case

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,400
having a professional to talk things out

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,120
with and how to process your feelings

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,640
with and

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,600
check in with i think it's vitally

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,440
important in any sort of recovery

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,559
process and then just getting out of

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,559
the office one of my problems working at

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,000
highland was that you know i

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,760
come fresh out of the course all my

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,760
friends are my ex's friends so i made

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,039
new friends and i made them at work

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,480
and these people are still my friends

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,159
even though i don't work at highland

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,600
they're amazing

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,240
but we'd be like oh yeah we should hang

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,000
out after work and hanging out after

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,400
work was booking a conference room at

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,640
work

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,640
after work which didn't help with my

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,200
work-life balance that didn't exist

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,559
because

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,000
also all of my friends were work so

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,159
even if you can get out on your lunch

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,720
break take a walk you can just go out to

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,679
the parking lot of your job and if you

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,200
work from home

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,799
leave your house go out in your driveway

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,400
go in your backyard do something that

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,919
gets you away from your work environment

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,520
for at least a little bit

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,320
every single day so helpful

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,000
but i am out of time and because i'm out

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,000

facts as well as you spoke at our last

so thank you for both of those um

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,960
somebody had asked us in our artifacts

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,799
live channel

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,960
do you have any advice for figuring out

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,279
which responsibilities can or should be

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,720
delegated when you're a team of one

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:47,279
oh when you're attainable that's

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,640
is there if there's any hope of becoming

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,559
a team of two

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,640
i would do that but i understand that's

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,840
not always possible

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,120
um for me i've been lucky to have other

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,320
support

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,039
um i don't know for a team of one i

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,120
would just say

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,399
is there something in your personal life

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,799
that you can delegate out

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,440
even you know i had the ability to send

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,840
my partner

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,200
out for meals can you do something like

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,200
a meal planning

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,720
service or subscription service or

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,399
something that will deliver that to your

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,440
door instead of having to go grocery

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,600
shopping

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,360
um can you find any way to kind of

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,559
automate and make your life

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,399
easier with really anything and delegate

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,440
that out to a service

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,440
drive cleaning pickup

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,039
yeah those are some good thoughts

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,320
uh i i was also thinking about how with

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,159
a lot of remote jobs

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,240
you know people especially if they've

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,600
been working in person

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,440
for their job there's probably this

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,760
higher stress level that people

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,679
have this need to feel productive or

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,200
work a lot or at odder hours

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,120
you have suggestions on how they could

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,039
try and reduce their stress when maybe

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,880
the tamer management kind of expects him

00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,399
to be this rock star at home

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,760
so fun story with uh harley davidson

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,120
dealer systems right now

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,880
we are all working overtime uh because

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,720
we are beholden to the motor company and

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,480
the motor company's deadlines

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,840
did not get moved when we lost some

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,000
staff and

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,880
long story short everyone is working a

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,559
lot

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,320
from home because we don't have an

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,600
office anymore

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,279
and ever again so everyone at my job has

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,120
been adjusting to that

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,960
exact situation um for me

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,799
my work-life balance is obviously it's

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,679
really important to me now i've changed

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,559
jobs twice

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,440
in pursuit of a better balance and i'm

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,399
really protective of my time at home

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,360
so this in this entire area that you

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,000
have seen

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,679
around me is brand new it's been built

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,720
once i found out that i wouldn't have an

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,240
office ever again

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,120
at harley-davidson um

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,679
at lunchtime i may next i may not get to

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,919
take my full lunch time

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,880
but there's gonna be at least 20 minutes

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,360
where i am

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,960
i am off do not send me teams messages

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,760
because i will not get them i am not in

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,159
this room

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,600
i am elsewhere in my house i'm taking a

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,919
walk outside i am

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,679
gone if it is really important i have

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,120
teams on my phone and you can tag me but

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,360
if you tell me when it's not important

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,640
i'll be mad

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,880
it's okay to be mad at your teammates um

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,320
other than that scheduling is a big one

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,279
making sure that we have

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,360
enough devs on at one time to pair and

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,960
do work and knock things out

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,640
and then if all else fails

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,159
push back to your management your

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,360
manager probably cares about you more

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,600
than you think

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,880
um the dev team that harley davidson has

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,960
been really

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,559
really fortunate to have a manager that

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,120
will push back to the product team

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,559
when they enact a kind of unreasonable

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,039
deadline on us

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,679
and also just call me because i'll yell

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,600
for you

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,799
like my team has learned that i don't

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,519
have a filter on

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,080
us and so some of the product teams have

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,919
gotten

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,600
have gotten like full touring why is

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,399
this our problem because we didn't set

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,399
these deadlines

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,559
it's about boundaries and sometimes you

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,919
have to enforce them using your voice

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:12,640
very loudly and forcefully over teens

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,480
yeah you'd also mention taking your

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,640
vacation days which i

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,399
i guess hypocritically agree with you

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
because i know right now i've started a

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,360
new job

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,120
and i'm probably probably could use a

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,480
little vacation but feeling guilty about

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,559
trying to take it

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,240
any ideas on how to ensure people do

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,679
things like this or cutting your clutter

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,799
or some of the other things you

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,279
suggested

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,360
i am i'm also a vacation day hypocrite i

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,120
will afford my vacation days

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,399
um i have to force myself to actually

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,080
use them

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,279
um part of my problem is that i always

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,200
want to take off like the end of the

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,320
year like that weird christmas new

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,600
year's time

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,200
like i always want to take that off and

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,120
then i'm like i can't use them anywhere

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,039
else because i want that i'm like i get

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,799
i get three weeks and that's like a week

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,080
max so tori what are you doing you need

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,640
to like

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,159
go somewhere and at the height of my

00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,679
burnout i actually had a friend who was

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,320
like uh you need a vacation and i was

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,919
like

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,960
patrick i don't take vacations i don't

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,399
like i just i gave him school i don't

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,760
take vacations because i can't because

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,840
everyone needs me

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,240
and he told me that wasn't good for me

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,200
and i told him to f off

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,159
um but it's find something that you want

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,640
to do

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,200
so when you think about what kind of

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,480
downtime

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,960
is important to you like for me it's

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,320
getting outside and i know

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,159
that i can get outside in the winter

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,840
i don't mind winter camping but other

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,039
people do and so if i want to go out

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
with my friends and we want to go

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,880
camping

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,080
i need to take a vacation

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,919
during the summer and i will

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,840
contact people we will schedule that in

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,679
advance and it will get on the schedule

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,120
as soon as possible and i will tell my

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,360
manager and that i can't change it

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,200
so it's getting it on the schedule it's

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,600
kind of identifying what is important to

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,039
you to do outside of work

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,840
and scheduling that it's not don't take

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,679
a vacation

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,200
and just like stay at home and watch tv

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,960
i know i talked about non-productive

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,039
activity

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,320
but use a vacation to motivate you to do

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,520
something else that you care about to

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,399
get away to travel

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,560
to do something fun and don't think

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,679
about work for a while

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,839
yeah you had also suggested hobbies or

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,000
non-productive time as important things

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,280
to make sure you schedule for

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,480
do you have suggestions on one either

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,679
how to pick up

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,280
a hobby or more reliably pick one up if

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,720
you maybe already have it you're just

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,359
not doing it lately

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,040
or other suggestions on like if you

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,879
cleared space out of your calendar

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,040
not filling it back up again with things

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,679
that don't matter so much

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,399
so when i say like a non-productive

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,919
hobby

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,320
i have a whole i have a whole lot of

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,679
hobbies that result in an end product

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,520
and i enjoy doing them um and at first

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,280
when i first started i i didn't allow

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,280
myself to do any of them

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,480
because i was like this is sit on the

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,640
couch and watch

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,079
netflix time this is not where it goes

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,280
and makes a really elaborate cake

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:08,079
time this is not doing things

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,440
time and i've since been able to work

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,680
elaborate cakes

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,520
and hiking and reading books and things

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,200
back into my schedule because those are

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,720
things that i care about

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,160
i mean those are those are hobbies those

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,800
are things that you give me if you film

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,079
it

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,760
but at first i i focused on doing

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,119
nothing because i had to relearn how to

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,000
do nothing

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,960
and then as far as picking up a hobby is

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,480
finding something

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,800
that's important to you to fill your

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,040
non-work time

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,160
i mean what go back to maybe what you

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,240
wanted to do

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,920
as a kid like when you were little what

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,359
were you interested in it was probably i

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,119
don't know space or dinosaurs would seem

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,119
really universal

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,400
um my kid could tell you about space and

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,800
dinosaurs all day long

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,880
i got over my my space phase but i'll

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,320
still go outside and look at stars

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,760
that's fine i got back into baking after

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,359
years um actually i picked up baking as

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,520
a way to deal with anxiety

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,880
years ago and picked it back up and

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,320
moved into cakes although i'm really

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,880
more into the

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,400
decorating than the making now but

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,920
really just

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,480
and if you can't pick anything if you

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,359
were paralyzed for choice

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,560
there are dozens of if you can force

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,520
yourself to go out and interact with

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,359
people if you're not like me

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,040
i'm a massive introvert there are tons

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,640
of meetup groups that you can go and

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,560
like you only need to meet those people

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,160
once and if you're not into them

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,000
like if you're not into whatever they're

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,200
they're doing you never have to see

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,800
those people again

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,240
you can try it out once and move on with

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,320
your life it's

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,359
it's okay to quit something if you don't

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,640
like it

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:41,839
you don't have to choose a hobby if you

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,839
stuck with it forever

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,400
