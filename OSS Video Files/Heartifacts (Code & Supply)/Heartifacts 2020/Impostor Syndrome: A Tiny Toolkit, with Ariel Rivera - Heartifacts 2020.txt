Feeling like a fraud, or that you don’t deserve to be in the room, is sadly easy enough in any industry. In the tech landscape it’s that much simpler, with languages to learn, systems to understand, and roles to have experience in - and to my dismay, there’s no mockumentary or fine-tuned HBO show to allay the sentiment. Ideally, there’d be a series where there’s a “diverse and fun-loving group of friends who deal with imposter syndrome in moving up in their jobs and life in the big city”. Nothing brilliant by any means, but utterly relatable.

We don’t have that, at least not yet, but I’ve learned that imposter syndrome can be as big a beast as any, and I’ve read and experimented with small steps in how to try and get past those moments in which it causes anxiety.

In this talk, I’ll discuss experiences like job applications and networking events, and present my tiny toolkit of steps for handling imposter syndrome in a way that is honest and accepting for what works for you.
