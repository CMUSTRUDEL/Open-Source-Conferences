Title: Hacking Your Emotional API
Publication date: 2018-05-01
Playlist: Heartifacts
Description: 
	Being a good developer isn't just about slinging code; we're part of a community. Interacting with others in a community means feelings are involved.

In this talk you'll learn how emotions are affecting you by modeling them as an API and looking at the code.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
good morning everybody I'm so excited to

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,750
be here opening a conference dedicated

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,099
to the human side of software I think

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,500
because computers are built with

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,109
advanced physics and chemistry people

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,660
like to clothe the work of software in a

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,250
suit of science to think that it can be

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,470
reduced solely to bits and registers and

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,689
this leads to myriad problems from

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,599
dubious ethics to the failings of

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,450
meritocracy and I think the way to

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,880
counter this reductionism is to do what

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,399
we're doing here today talking about our

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,579
humanity re-centering that experience in

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,559
the industry

00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,660
and it seems to me that most of the

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,670
speakers here are talking about really

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,680
one thing and that's kindness and ways

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:59,550
that we can make ourselves and each

00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:01,800
other better I can't wait I'm gonna talk

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,559
about the complexities of our emotional

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,930
system and I'm gonna use some software

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,479
metaphors to do that and it's gonna

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,729
focus a little bit on the way they

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,890
affect my life and the lives of other

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,580
developers but the principles apply

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,960
outside of technology just as easily and

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,479
I'm reusing a couple of software

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,950
metaphors in this talk but there's only

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,740
really two that you need to understand

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,500
for it to make sense the first is an epi

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,420
which is just a contract between two

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,000
software systems about how they're going

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,560
to communicate with each other so it

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,060
could be two servers at different

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,920
companies on the internet or two

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,250
different systems within your computer

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,470
and exchanging information the second

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,600
bit of second concept is of what's

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,430
called a middleware which is a layer of

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,450
software that translates but from one

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,700
system to another

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,680
so commands will come in one side

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,210
they'll be transformed and then sent out

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,000
the other side sort of like a software

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,759
adapter and that's really it that's all

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,680
you're gonna need to know also a quick

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,420
content warning I'm gonna talk about

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,219
divorce and the death of a loved one and

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,619
if you need to step out for any reason

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:12,239
please do so my name is John Sawers I've

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,530
been coding professionally for more than

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,010
20 years

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,710
and in addition to being a CTO founder

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,070
and developer I've also spent many years

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,290
working with people as they delved into

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:29,850
their deepest and most intense emotions

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,670
and from that work I developed this API

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,040
this metaphor to explain how emotions

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,400
work because people don't really

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,350
understand that very well and so I'll

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,390
walk you through the metaphor I'll talk

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,880
about why that work is important and

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,680
then I'll also dive into a number of

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,770
techniques that you can use to level up

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:57,330
your skills in this area but first I

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:59,070
will start with a quote it's pretty

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,470
funny and I think we can all relate to

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,780
it and I start wondering well how come

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,790
we all feel this way that we don't

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,770
really understand what's going on here

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,890
and I think a lot of it comes down to

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,750
how we're raised I think even as

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,810
children were given a lot of instruction

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,209
about what not to do don't run don't

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,870
yell don't make a scene lots of

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,680
not-not-not

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,750
oh we're never given is a list of things

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,310
that we should do to stay emotionally

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,160
healthy to process our feelings in

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,080
appropriate ways our parents probably

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,900
didn't give us this info probably

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,700
because they themselves didn't know

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,200
schools don't do this they'll punish you

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,739
for doing it improperly but they don't

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,890
have any classes on how to get good so

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,750
each of us is on our own to figure out

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:51,540
how this thing works on our own and

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,950
because of that success is uneven so

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,420
I've put this talk together because I

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,180
want to help everyone improve in this

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,600
area to help everyone populate the list

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,670
on that previous slide it's a big number

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,610
of things that they can do whenever they

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,670
need and this talk is built from my own

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,170
experiences it's one way to think about

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,150
how feelings work but it's not the only

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,709
one so if this doesn't work for you

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,459
that's completely fine I hope that you

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:20,430
can find a model that does work so let's

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:24,240
talk about our emotional API these are

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,680
our core emotional endpoints they handle

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,050
all the basic emotions and they're

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,460
hardwired in

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,730
but these endpoints don't get called

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,120
directly we have this layer of emotional

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:38,700
middleware that takes events happening

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,270
to us and translates into feeling

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,890
reactions and these mappings are created

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,450
over the course of our lives we start

00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,060
out with none but we end up with a lot

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:51,780
and they're very flexible and they vary

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,060
between people we see in this diagram

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,340
you know one event triggering one

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,860
feeling and that can sometimes be the

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,480
case but often this there can be a lot

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,420
of complexity in this middleware there

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,460
can be large chunks of code that

00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:08,520
actually send a lot of traffic into that

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,450
core API so let's look at an example of

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,100
what that might be

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,590
we'll start at the top that's sort of

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,460
losing your job example the code for

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:20,220
that mate look like this that's 100

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,590
calls to your fear API 20 calls to your

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,530
sadness API that's going to be a very

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:30,200
intense experience for someone there's

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:33,690
also some bad news it's a public API

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,110
anybody anywhere any event can call any

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:40,290
of those endpoints at any time but it's

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,669
okay because by practicing some of the

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,900
tools I'm going to tell you about today

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:48,060
you can rewrite that middle where you

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,690
can refactor the code so that you get to

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,290
choose what responses you send it when

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,390
those events happen to you and that's my

00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,620
metaphor it's a framework for

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,290
understanding and processing your

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,910
feelings what I like about this model is

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,940
that it takes as big sort of ill-defined

00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,280
messy they know called feelings breaks

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,220
it down into some smaller ideas that are

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,669
easier to talk about easier to explain

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:22,260
and understand and I'll segue into the

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:24,510
next section with another quote I don't

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,570
like working with emotions you probably

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:30,030
don't either and unfortunately there's

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,160
nothing I can do about that so what I'm

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:36,289
going to do now is try and explain why

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:40,820
it's worth going through that work to

00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:43,770
get through that discomfort and

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,360
make things better and I'll talk about

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,190
some of the surprising and not so

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,810
surprising ways that emotions are

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:54,450
impacting our life so I'll start with

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,370
one unpleasant truth and that is that

00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:00,060
you can't actually avoid your feelings

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,150
in studies where they asked people to

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,400
suppress my negative emotional response

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,990
we see them fail all the participants

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,490
thought that they were doing fine they

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,890
like yeah I got this nobody can tell

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,350
when we peer into their nervous system

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:16,170
we can see the effect is still there or

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,630
it's intensified so pretending that

00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:24,120
you're not feeling something can make it

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:26,370
worse so emotions are unavoidable let's

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,200
look at how they affect us when we're

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:33,180
sitting alone just writing some code so

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,240
unprocessed feelings make us feel

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,670
powerless and the powerlessness I'm

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,010
talking about is that feeling of not

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,990
being in control of your life or your

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,530
career or not being able to handle

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,720
whatever comes at you and so think about

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,060
the last time some big emotional event

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,160
happened to you like losing your job for

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,440
example in that situation you probably

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,260
didn't feel powerful but even in less

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,770
intense situations that same effect can

00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,240
be what happened to us and in studies

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,700
that looked at this effect of

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,520
powerlessness on people they saw a

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,320
specific deficit in what's called a

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,450
executive function now executive

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,790
function is our ability to control our

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:18,470
attention to focus and deeply on things

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:21,450
organized and keep details and track and

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:25,590
I think that sounds like what most of us

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:27,450
do all day so when that's impacted we

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,180
lose our ability to focus deeply and on

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:34,650
code to find bugs and to sign new

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,380
complicated systems it also affects our

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,849
short-term memory so think about how

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,830
much of a system you can hold in your

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:44,099
head but you're tracing through trying

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:47,130
to find the source of the bug what also

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,690
affects our ability to handle stress so

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,880
think about the last production outage

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,740
you are a part of or a demo before

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,010
executives or even just crunch time

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,899
before a release

00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:02,199
do you want that stress to affect you

00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:03,579
this much or this much conversely when

00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:05,769
you have a good framework for handling

00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:08,889
your feelings you get back that sense of

00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:11,800
control of power you reverse all the

00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:13,329
problems I just mentioned when children

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,820
were trained in these techniques of what

00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:17,560
they call emotional hygiene their

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,990
behavior improved as you would expect

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,160
but their grades also improved it was a

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,310
measurable increase in academic

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,800
achievement and when adults were trained

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,320
in these same skills we also saw a

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,339
measurable increase in long-term health

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,579
outcomes

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:38,230
think about that yes your body works

00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:39,970
better when your feelings work better so

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,279
being a developer isn't just about

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,570
slinging code though we're part of a

00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,730
community and in many ways the

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,709
non-coding aspects of software are

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,620
becoming more important than the coding

00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:52,779
ones and they're more of them so whether

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,050
it's an open source project a large

00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:57,399
corporate team or a two-person start-up

00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,000
thriving in a diverse community requires

00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:04,000
us develop skills in communication

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,740
empathy and understanding so let's look

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,810
at how feelings impact how we work with

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,760
others interestingly when you develop an

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,470
understanding of your own emotions that

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,180
work automatically translates and

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:20,230
willing to understand and empathize with

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,269
other people and in his book emotional

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,130
intelligence Daniel Goleman talks about

00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:27,149
the correlation he's found between

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,560
career progress and emotional skills

00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,630
basically you get better jobs and you

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:38,910
get promoted faster you have these

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:43,630
skills and when we regain that power

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:44,889
we're less self-centered and we increase

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,230
our ability to empathize

00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:50,290
we rarely intend to cause harm with our

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,269
words but empathy helps us keep an eye

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,160
out for how they're gonna come across to

00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,470
other people so that we can avoid

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,990
accidentally doing things that are gonna

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,480
hurt people I got a chance to see

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,130
Laura's talk earlier this week that's

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,750
the Harry the Hedgehog talk it's at 1:00

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,029
p.m. today and it really delves into a

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,610
lot of practical ways of keeping track

00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:12,080
of this and

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,460
communication is really great so let's

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,500
go into some detailed scenarios that

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,350
illustrate how this can play out in

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,720
day-to-day life for my perspective

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,580
you're a better developer if your

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,130
emotional state isn't impacting your

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,020
ability to think clearly if you have the

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,760
confidence to express your ideas and

00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,650
advocate for them without thinking

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,980
incorrectly that nobody wants to hear

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:36,410
from you if your comets are full of

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,620
empathy and understanding and don't make

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,000
your team dread getting your input if

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,180
you're not distracted by difficult

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,680
emotional situations outside of work if

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,690
you can deal with co-workers that push

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,610
your buttons so that your work

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,840
performance isn't impacted by someone

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:55,010
else who doesn't have their act together

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,890
if you can fight an imposter syndrome

00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,600
and more importantly if you can realize

00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,880
when you're being gaslighted when you

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,540
can see a situation clearly enough to

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,120
realize that actually is unfair if you

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,010
can keep your cool during job interviews

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,730
or if you can be fired without saying or

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:17,030
doing something you'll regret and let's

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,340
talk about leadership for a moment these

00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,560
skills are critical for managing and

00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,060
mentoring a team of developers you know

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,740
they're actually people and they have

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,540
emotional needs and understanding those

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,530
are gonna make you far far more

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:32,600
effective a while back frontside IO ran

00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,520
an article about what they look for in a

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,640
senior developer and talks a lot about

00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,190
these issues if you notice pretty much

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,350
everything in all of those circles has a

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,320
huge emotional intelligence component to

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,720
it even the technical capability circle

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,170
talks about behavior not whether you've

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,570
got 10 years of Java or not

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:59,390
curiosity disciplined fearlessness these

00:12:53,570 --> 00:13:00,410
are emotional skills so those are some

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,060
of the reasons why I think it's

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:05,060
important to do this work I think it has

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,550
a huge benefit on us now I'm going to

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:11,240
talk about my toolkit for dealing with

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:13,580
emotions so that you can get better at

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,170
handling them I've broken it down into

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,170
four levels of difficulty

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:29,350
level one are new ways to think about

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:32,410
emotions level two are techniques that

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,150
you can use by yourself to practice and

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,720
get some more fluency with how your own

00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,400
emotions work level 3 skills are

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,830
applying those level 2 techniques but

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,930
with somebody else this is a little bit

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,310
harder because it involves being open

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,700
and vulnerable with some with another

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,160
person and level 4 skills are the most

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,330
powerful and also the most difficult

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,410
because they involve being open and

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:59,650
vulnerable in a group of people let's

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,670
start with the easy stuff in level 1 so

00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,529
changing the way you think about

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,839
emotions can actually have a huge impact

00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:06,820
because we get no formal training in

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,130
this a lot of us have misconceptions

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:13,779
about how feelings work so I'm gonna

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:16,150
clear those up and explain it all the

00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:18,070
first thing to realize is that our

00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,740
emotional reactions are not set in stone

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:24,839
they're legacy code that's built up over

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:27,850
our lifetime and it can be rewritten and

00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,160
we get to decide when and where we

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,650
process our emotions we have this great

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,600
background job queue available well

00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,520
let's just find the best time to in

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,709
place to process our feelings so if now

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,870
isn't a good time we can place that

00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:45,010
feeling on a queue and come back to it

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,810
later and this queue is actually the

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,310
same thing we've been using since we

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,650
were children when we're told not to do

00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:53,950
things and we learned how to not have an

00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,930
outburst in the middle of Denny's but

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,089
the problem is we have never been given

00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,040
those skills for bringing jobs back off

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,600
that queue and running them

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:06,910
so this queue has probably been just

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,770
building up our entire lives and people

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:13,120
get really caught up in what it means

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:15,730
about them when they have feelings but I

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,900
want to tell you having a feeling does

00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,250
not mean anything about you

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,020
now feelings are very personal they can

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:26,829
mean a lot to you but they don't define

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:29,350
you in any way if you're feeling angry

00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:30,370
it doesn't mean that you're an angry

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,140
person

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,900
it doesn't mean you can't control

00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:39,550
yourself or that you're a monster it's

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:41,620
just a feeling but strong emotions can

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,050
be kind of scary because they feels like

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,400
you might lose control anger in

00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:49,240
particular does this because it's a very

00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,820
energetic emotion and notice what I just

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,900
described there you're no feeling afraid

00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:58,150
of feeling angry and that's pretty

00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,990
complicated but it can go deeper than

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:03,490
that imagine for example you're angry at

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,230
your mother but the way you were raised

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,510
that wasn't something you are really

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,140
allowed to do so you know feel ashamed

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:13,330
about feeling angry about your mother

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,610
further imagine that you're now aware of

00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,640
this cycle this reaction that you have

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,200
but you haven't quite broken out of it

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,930
so maybe you feel disgust about the

00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:27,339
shame that you feel about the anger and

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:28,960
maybe that makes you angry so you can

00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:31,240
have these multiple conflicting feelings

00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,400
about a situation and people always want

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,670
to know which is the real one the answer

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,900
is all of them they're all real feelings

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:42,100
there's no such thing as how you really

00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:45,339
feel and the feelings that arrive in a

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,870
situation don't have to make sense think

00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,760
of that losing your job example from

00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,430
earlier you can react to that with

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,990
relief with anger with guilt with

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,510
sadness or all four of those mixed

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:59,290
together there's no one thing you should

00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:00,640
feel in that situation and even if the

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,880
feeling doesn't make sense in the

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,300
situation it still has to be treated

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,699
that's valid for example you can feel

00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,199
like a situation is unfair then think

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,439
about it some more and realize now it's

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,510
probably fine but and sometimes that

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,520
will remove the feeling oh yeah that's

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,170
right it's fine but sometimes it doesn't

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,280
sometimes that feeling is still there

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,520
and even though it doesn't mesh with

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,199
reality it's still a feeling that needs

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,510
to be handled on its own you still have

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,140
to feel it and process it when you do

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,710
it'll go away

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,960
and then you'll be right also one last

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:38,080
piece many of us have had the experience

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,610
of feeling like a feeling is so big but

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,330
if we let even a little bit of it out

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,020
that it's never good stuff if I express

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,900
this anger

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:50,980
we'll never stop yelling express the

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,380
sadness I will never stop crying but

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,570
that will not happen

00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,840
experts tell me that feelings really

00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,430
only lasts about 20 minutes and this

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,410
matches my experience over and over

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:05,140
again that they just will not go on

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:10,540
forever it feels like they will but they

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:12,100
won't so that's level one level two

00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,080
actions are things you can do on your

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,680
own to start building an understanding

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,330
of yourself and your emotional reactions

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:23,970
and to start having some experience of

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:27,150
understanding the concept level one now

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,620
feelings begin in your physical body

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,570
they're physical they're not just mental

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,720
processes and all they want to do is

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,950
move through you and out it's like when

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,210
you've had too much coffee your body

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:42,190
really wants to move and so actually

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,980
doing the movement can help those

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,860
feelings come out and be expressed so

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,500
you can dance run sing exercise any of

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,810
these things will help in fact sometimes

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,550
the first thing you notice about a

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,230
feeling is actually just a physical

00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,810
sensation you don't actually know what

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,270
the feeling itself is and doing these

00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,800
you know moving your body can help that

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,160
come out and then you can realize what

00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,960
actually going on but to make real

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,630
progress you have to feel the feeling

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:15,070
you can't just go for a run and hope it

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:18,160
goes away so I'll do a quick aside here

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,960
about rubber duck debugging and if you

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,860
haven't heard about that I'll do a quick

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,230
summary for you

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,340
so you ever have this experience where

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,930
you're banging your head against the

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,130
problem for a long time and eventually

00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,320
get frustrated enough that you're going

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,480
to go ask a co-worker to help you figure

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,830
out what's going on so you get it from

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,590
you desk you walk over there you start

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:38,230
explaining the problem and as you say

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:41,860
the words boom a flash of insight

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:43,330
happens and this is such a common

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,730
experience that a hack has been

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,160
developed to short-circuit this process

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:51,190
keep a rubber duck on your desk works

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,510
with a cat or a dog too and before you

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,250
get frustrated enough to go talk to

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,440
someone else you explain the problem to

00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,500
them as if they were a person and you

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,470
know sometimes they are

00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:05,690
and that's often enough to trigger that

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:06,320
same burst of insight so being aware of

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,649
your emotions

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,929
talking about them naming them is really

00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:15,259
helpful so I'm gonna give you some tips

00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:16,820
about talking for about feelings now you

00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:17,960
may have noticed that we're currently in

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,379
the section about things that you do

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,110
alone let me explain this is where the

00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:25,759
duck comes in the same trick works when

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,789
talking about feelings you can talk to

00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,159
nobody and it still has a lot of the

00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:33,590
same impact

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,940
so sometimes talking through a feeling

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,210
is all that's really required to process

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,879
it just by exploring it verbally you can

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:44,149
feel it enough then it will be fully

00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:45,860
handled so think of it as a process of

00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:46,970
like verbally exploring a feeling space

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,379
like you're trying to find the right

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,230
word for it so you trying a bunch of

00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:52,490
different ones and sometimes you'll even

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,799
discovery you don't know what the

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,600
feeling was until you hit upon that one

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,889
word for it that describes it and then

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,340
you actually know what it is you're

00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:03,590
feeling and it can be fine to hard hard

00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,779
to find the right word because we don't

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,450
have a lot of practice in this so this

00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:11,269
field will will help you pick a good

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:14,389
word it was developed by dr. Gloria

00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:16,669
Wilcox back in the 80s and it's not

00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:18,080
exhaustive and you might not even agree

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:20,509
with some of the ways that things are

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,039
set up in the hierarchy there but it's a

00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:23,960
great way to start talking about

00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,960
feelings and trying to find precise

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,610
words to describe what you're feeling

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,960
come up to me after the talk I can give

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:34,250
you a copy of this if you'd like so the

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,250
language we use when we talk about

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:42,379
feelings is really important typically

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:45,860
you say I'm angry but I would suggest

00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:47,600
that instead you say I feel angry it's a

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,639
small change in words but the meaning is

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,740
actually drastically different when you

00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:54,470
say I feel angry you're saying I'm

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,029
currently feeling angry and because

00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,830
we're better ly or slightly we know it's

00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:01,309
gonna it's not gonna last very long when

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:04,940
you say I am angry you're saying anger

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:07,039
defines me and that's a little bit

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,649
hyperbolic but the truth is really in

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,700
there and so I suggest making that

00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:15,529
switch and

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:17,119
even in casual conversation so talking

00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:18,889
for a feeling is basically just calling

00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,659
your own emotional API endpoints over

00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:22,369
and over again and like anything you

00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:24,559
practice you get better at it you start

00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:29,690
getting a sense of what it feels like to

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:33,019
feel that feeling and so I suggest doing

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,299
this at a regular cadence like a weekly

00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,309
emotional retrospective like a sprint

00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:39,739
retro where you can just look back on

00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:42,590
your week and like catalog the feelings

00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:44,210
that you felt and you can do it as

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,249
simply as just naming them and just

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,200
having a list there or you can spend

00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:49,909
more time Adele really into them what

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,100
was the underlying feeling what was the

00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:54,769
cause maybe where that came from deeper

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,929
into your past but even just writing

00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:59,659
down a list of names is really helpful

00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:01,279
and taking time to practice this on the

00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,710
day-to-day feelings of things that are

00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,600
just here and there and little things

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,279
can make it a lot more helpful when you

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,840
have some big intense emotional

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,820
experience in the process because you

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:17,749
already started knowing what it feels

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:21,109
like to do this so you can develop a lot

00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:22,580
of skills on your own doing this things

00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:27,529
get a lot more powerful and you've got

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:29,059
another person there in addition to

00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:30,859
helping you process your feelings to

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,059
help you give you back input and

00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:34,429
feedback and what you're talking about

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:36,859
it strengthens relationships to talk

00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:38,989
about feelings with people it makes them

00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:42,440
feel trusted and included increases

00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:44,299
their trust in you and it can be as

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,489
simple as sharing your emotional Retro

00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:49,940
with someone just a quick catch-up or

00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:51,859
just a simple share here and there maybe

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,789
answer honestly when they ask you how

00:23:51,859 --> 00:24:00,049
you're doing but emotional sharing isn't

00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:00,529
helpful in all situations imagine at

00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:03,440
work

00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:06,580
a co-worker gets credit for an idea that

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,320
you proposed that makes it really angry

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,149
what you want to do is figure out what

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,499
you're angry about are you angry at your

00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,600
boss or at the co-worker at the

00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:17,419
situation and then you want to feel that

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,239
anger you want to express it alone or

00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:22,039
with someone unrelated to the situation

00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:24,080
once you've done that once that feeling

00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:25,159
is mostly gone

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,679
then you can start thinking about

00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:28,850
resolution about what would make that

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,220
situation better

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,440
you can decide well I don't feel angry

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,850
anymore maybe there's nothing I want to

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,130
do now about this right now

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,799
or you can decide I want to go talk to

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,799
this person and you can say to them this

00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:45,320
thing made me angry but you don't want

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,120
to be angry when you're doing it that's

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,130
often very counterproductive it puts the

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,080
other person on the defensive makes the

00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,820
discussion about everybody's feelings

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,919
right then and there and not about the

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:58,970
resolution that will make everybody feel

00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:01,880
better in the end and sometimes you need

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:04,429
to bring in a consultant there continues

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,260
to be this judgment that therapy is only

00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:08,269
for people that have big emotional

00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,750
psychological problems or that they

00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:13,309
can't handle their life but working with

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,960
a therapist should have no more stigma

00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:18,320
than bringing in a consultant to

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,570
architect your next integration having a

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,370
subject matter expert on call to help

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,429
you spot the pitfalls that are coming up

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,710
to be a resource for ask questions for

00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:33,110
or to see here blind spots

00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:35,809
you're really really helpful for most

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,580
people the thought of baring their

00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:41,210
deepest and most intense emotions in a

00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:44,120
group is completely terrifying and it

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,019
was for me and until I did it I had no

00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,450
idea how powerful it could be at the

00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:53,419
urging of someone I trusted I went to a

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:56,450
workshop called purpose passion peace p3

00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:57,799
for short I had literally no idea what

00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,389
was gonna happen to be but for the next

00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:02,380
two days but I just trusted that it was

00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:05,210
gonna be good and there I found an

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,980
amazingly safe space a space that was

00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,779
safe enough for me to face all the big

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,980
intense feelings that I've been avoiding

00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:14,929
my entire life and I don't have any and

00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,639
I had such an amazing experience that I

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:18,139
went back every time they did the

00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:20,690
workshop to help other people go through

00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:22,519
it too and I eventually we started

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,889
supervising and organizing the weekends

00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,630
because it was so valuable to me and so

00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:29,620
gratifying to help other people go

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,940
through that same intense process I

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,350
don't have any psychology training but I

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,990
learned so much from that direct

00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,430
experience both in digging through my

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,780
deepest feelings

00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,160
and seeing other people go through that

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,790
same process and seeing the

00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:46,520
commonalities so I'm going to tell you

00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:48,620
about my experience with anger I do this

00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,300
for several reasons first it's a vivid

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,370
example and it illustrates some of the

00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,040
level three and four tools that I'm

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:57,350
talking about but secondly and more

00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,420
importantly I want to model the behavior

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,980
I want to show you what it looks like

00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:07,400
for someone to talk about these things

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:10,490
in a room full of people as a child I

00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,530
was not allowed to get angry other

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,410
people used up all the anger points and

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:17,090
there were none left for me so my only

00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,830
option was to just be pleasant all the

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,950
time and I did that for thirty years

00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,630
once

00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,790
I was into my late twenties I started

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:29,630
realizing how much anger had been

00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:33,110
building up over my lifetime and I was

00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:35,000
deathly afraid of it at the time this is

00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:38,360
my instruction list for dealing with

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,950
anger there's nothing there I was

00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,660
working with a therapist at the time and

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,430
she was trying to get me to get in touch

00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:46,100
with it when she had this tiny little

00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:48,020
office and I was convinced the moment I

00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,520
really started to let it out the

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,170
furniture will be broken the books

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:56,540
scattered around like it would just be a

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:59,450
disaster so I was stuck I had no way to

00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,890
deal with that anger and it wasn't until

00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,580
I was in that room with p3 that I

00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:08,840
finally felt safe enough to express it

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:14,030
and so I did I I screamed and I threw

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:18,380
the biggest fit of my entire life and it

00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:21,590
was amazing and nobody died and nothing

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:24,230
broke and nobody was upset with me it

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:27,080
was so cool and I did it again and again

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,490
like multiple times not every time I

00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,300
went back but every time I felt like I

00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:34,870
needed to and every time I did it I felt

00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:38,030
like I'd lost 50 pounds it was so great

00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:40,520
so throwing a fit is actually a really

00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,870
great way to express your anger and I'm

00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,780
pretty sure most of you have already

00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:46,700
done it a few times in your life but the

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,630
trick is getting back to doing it

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,760
because we've spent so long repressing

00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,620
urghhh so there are a couple of tricks

00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,150
that you can do to get there first of

00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,890
all you need to set aside time and space

00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:58,500
make something really comfortable like a

00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:01,800
big mattress or an air mattress and then

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,400
just lay down and start kicking punching

00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:07,230
and yelling as loud as you can but the

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,500
trick is that it's hard to do that

00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:12,630
because because we don't really aren't

00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:16,860
in touch with that feeling from deep

00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:19,800
long ago so once you start moving your

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,990
body in that sort of anger motion it'll

00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,390
start letting the feeling come out you

00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:27,420
will start feeling the anger even if you

00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:30,450
didn't when you start it and but the

00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:32,820
trick is that until you start feeling it

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,200
you feel like a complete idiot because

00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:37,710
you're sitting there doing this thing

00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,990
that's like a toddler thing and it's

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,970
really uncomfortable but that feeling

00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,610
will come and when it comes it will

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,980
bring so much energy with it and you'll

00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:50,040
just be able to put all your effort in

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,200
and you're only gonna go for five ten

00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,740
maybe fifteen minutes before you're

00:29:52,200 --> 00:30:00,360
completely exhausted and then don't make

00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:03,000
any plans for the rest of the day so you

00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,070
can do this alone you can do it with a

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,710
trusted friend or you can find a group

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,780
like p3 and do it with twenty people

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:13,170
you've just met supporting you in the

00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:17,460
most amazing way and I've done this a

00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:19,170
lot and things still make me angry today

00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,470
it's not like I've stopped being angry

00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:24,750
about things that's never gonna happen

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:27,200
but the anger I expressed today is not

00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:31,440
the anger from when I was 12 or five

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,930
that's all gone so when I do have a big

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,210
angry anger thing that I need to work on

00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,980
and I don't always have my act together

00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,140
enough to do this it's it's hard work

00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,480
takes a lot of effort to get myself

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,390
there even what I know it's so good for

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,100
me but when I do when I when I can

00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:51,120
really put it together I set aside some

00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:53,660
time and throw a fit so let's move on

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,660
the sadness

00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:05,860
this simple series of API calls

00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:08,830
describes a huge part of my life each

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:13,230
one of these API heads was devastating

00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:15,910
and each one multiplied upon the others

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,680
you see in different versions here these

00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:21,090
are the different ages I was at no show

00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,090
how that plays out in just a minute so

00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,620
no I was 5 my parents got divorced I

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,090
felt so many different feelings fear and

00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,360
sadness and blame and grief and all

00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:33,130
these things and the five year old mind

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,890
is very self-centered so even though

00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:41,080
everyone told me it wasn't my fault

00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:43,630
I knew that it was when I was 8 I found

00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,610
out my father had cancer and it

00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,680
triggered those same there's a bunch of

00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,330
new feelings about loss and grief and

00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,360
those triggered those same older

00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,980
feelings from before and they all got

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,510
sort of mixed in together those older

00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,490
feelings are more primal they're harder

00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,930
to process and of course I was only

00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,930
eight so I didn't really have any tools

00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:05,080
for this and then when I was 17 my

00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:06,790
father died and again those same

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,260
feelings come back again and again and

00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,810
they start multiplying together into

00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:14,290
those huge mass I was faced with all of

00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:17,200
it and I had enough no idea what to do I

00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:20,470
just held on for dear life and hope that

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:25,240
it will blow over but it didn't blow

00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:27,040
over 15 years after this it's a regular

00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,670
Thursday afternoon I'm releasing some

00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:34,300
code to production and a couple of bugs

00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:36,550
slipped through now we don't like

00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,110
releasing bugs to production but maybe

00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,970
it's not the end of the world if there's

00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:46,420
CSS is a little wonky at the bottom the

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:49,510
FAQ but to me it felt like panic I was

00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:52,210
thinking my boss daddy is gonna leave me

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:54,820
this is all these feelings all over

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,710
again this is a stack trace of what that

00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,930
feeling might look like we see these

00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:02,920
highlighted lines those are code I wrote

00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:06,370
when I was five have any of you written

00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:08,820
code when you were five was a really

00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,820
good code

00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,520
so I was reacting to something happening

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:17,040
to my an old self with the script

00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,990
written by a child and that's what these

00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,330
old unprocessed feelings do to us they

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:24,150
trap a part of us at the developmental

00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,830
age were at when the trauma happens so

00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,020
that those feelings are processed by the

00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:32,550
most primitive and damaged parts of

00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:36,300
ourselves so I did what you do a sadness

00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:39,600
in the safe space of p3 I cried and I

00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:41,880
cried into my muscles hurt and I did it

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,270
again and again over the years and

00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,340
eventually I got it all out do you

00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,750
remember this line there's so many

00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,900
feelings stacked on top of one another

00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:54,480
so I worked through each one in turn

00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:57,240
first with sadness then the grief and

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,980
the anger of the machine we look at a

00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,950
diff of what that code might look like

00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,810
now it's been refactored now of course

00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,910
if my father died today I would still

00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,500
feel a great amount of grief but it

00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,390
wouldn't ripple out with massive

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,280
problematic effects for the next 20

00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,570
years

00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,690
I'm not running that outdated code

00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,580
anymore and you like this sometimes you

00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,320
can completely rewrite the method if you

00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,760
look at that release from earlier this

00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:27,060
is what it looks like now it's basically

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:29,010
a no op so that's some of my baggage and

00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,920
you can see some of the effects it had

00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:33,300
on my life so I'd like you to think a

00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,310
little bit about what baggage you might

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,560
have that you could be bringing to your

00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:39,240
relationships at work or at home are

00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,640
there parts of you that are reacting to

00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:46,770
things like a five year old or a 10 year

00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:49,590
old or a 15 year old and that's my tool

00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:52,160
box the ultimate goal of all of these

00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:56,580
tools is to get you to a single place

00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:59,070
feeling a feeling not denying it not

00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:03,810
analyzing that stopping it not indulging

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:05,970
it just feeling it now since forever

00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,680
these skills have been called soft

00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:11,820
skills and I really hate that it's so

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,200
incorrect it takes a lot of time and

00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,300
effort to build up your skills in this

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,690
area far along and it takes to learn C

00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:21,390
or Ruby or docker or whatever and that's

00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,220
why I'm here speaking because I'm hoping

00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:27,450
this framework will help you get there

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:31,010
faster so as we start wrapping up let's

00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:33,900
talk about best practices and next steps

00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,670
so you know how you read that one blog

00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,470
post about best practices for whatever

00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,059
your framework or language is you get

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,460
really excited because office is gonna

00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:42,779
make Mike home so much better so you run

00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,079
down your editor and you pull it up you

00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:47,789
think yes I will do the thing at about 5

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,950
or 10 minutes later you completely give

00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:52,019
up because you realize that the inertia

00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,539
of your code base is gonna resist any

00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:57,329
sort of big architectural changes on any

00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,609
short time frame that's how it's gonna

00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:01,440
go with your feelings

00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:04,049
so then we'll try doing everything in

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,089
all the levels all at once pick just one

00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:08,039
thing that resonates you from this talk

00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:10,559
and try and incorporate it into your

00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,180
daily life just keep in the back of your

00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,039
mind think about how it's applying to

00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,599
your interactions once you feel like

00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:17,760
that's well integrated into your

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,579
thinking watch your video you can find

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,140
it at my website and pick the next thing

00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,240
and then integrate that one and then the

00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:29,759
next and that's how we build up these

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:32,190
skills also a note of warning as you

00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:33,900
start leveling up in this area it's

00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:38,609
tempting to judge other people that

00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:40,170
don't have the same skills to think that

00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:42,089
you're better than they are that you're

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,940
more advanced and I want you to fight

00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:46,440
that feeling fight the partner in your

00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,650
ego that says you're better than they

00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:53,190
are because you're not you just have a

00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:55,740
few more tools and if you can use those

00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,029
tools to help that other person help

00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,359
them go through what they're going

00:36:57,029 --> 00:37:01,650
through and then teach them the tool so

00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:03,960
that they can get better at going

00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,730
through things in the future and that's

00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,440
how we make ourselves in our lives that

00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:20,069
our world better ok everyone let's take

00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:21,839
