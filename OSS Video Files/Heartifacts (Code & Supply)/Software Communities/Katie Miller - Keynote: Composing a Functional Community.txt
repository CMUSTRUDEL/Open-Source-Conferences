Title: Katie Miller - Keynote: Composing a Functional Community
Publication date: 2017-07-21
Playlist: Software Communities
Description: 
	We know the wonderful benefits of functional programming, but when it comes to sharing the lambda love we often do a poor job. In this presentation, Katie will draw on her experiences as a journalist, workshop instructor, functional programming student and women's group founder to take you back to that time before you knew what jargon such as monad meant, and offer ideas and inspiration for helping people of all kinds and categories along the path to FP enlightenment. Be warned, content may challenge the status quo and your mind: be prepared for code in an unfamiliar syntax.

	00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:08,630
so today I'm going to talk about the

00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,950
functional programming community and how

00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,920
we might be able to improve the way that

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,599
we share the lamda love or in more

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,480
technical terms how we might be able to

00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,550
do some refactoring and rework to help

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,210
make the community a bit more extensible

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,369
I know that refactoring or change of any

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,680
kind really can be a bit of a slippery

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:30,109
subject but I think this is a really

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,430
important topic so please bear with me I

00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:33,280
promise there will be cute animal

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,300
pictures along the way

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,160
although this might be a bit

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,079
unconventional for a keynote I'd

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,210
actually like to start by showing you

00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,610
some code and I'm not actually going to

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:47,410
do it using one of these the left up or

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,410
the puppy I'm going to write it by hand

00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,469
so I'm going to pen the code in T line

00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:02,090
it's pretty clear how it was derived so

00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:05,899
I won't waste time explaining the syntax

00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,819
we'll put that as a slug at the top for

00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,359
miss compiler and the name of the

00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:13,249
conference

00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:15,289
- so Erlang user conference there you go

00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:18,590
you're all excited to be at the Erlang

00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:20,599
user conference yes you look like a

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,700
pretty smoking-hot audience if you don't

00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:24,079
mind me saying so fact I'm actually a

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,189
little bit worried this might be a bit

00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,170
too difficult for you

00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:29,899
it has its roots in secretarial science

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,340
and it is pretty hardcore I know you'd

00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:33,079
usually use Erlang for this sort of

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,479
thing but let's face it hardly anyone

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,509
likes the syntax so let's open our minds

00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:39,679
to a superior solution so let's start

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,880
with something you might be able to

00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:46,909
grasp we want to figure out SRV ours so

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,619
we'll declare that and to calculate them

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:52,729
we're going to call on the underscore

00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:54,349
Athenian and use that to percolate or as

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:58,130
I like to say do a bit of a pen or

00:01:54,349 --> 00:02:02,659
morphism we're passing and assembly of

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:04,009
points and a transformer even though you

00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,869
code in Erlang I'm sure you're familiar

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:12,379
with those at least that takes a point

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:14,840
and inside the transformer we're going

00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:15,900
to figure out a live rating by calling

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,480
on the next door

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:23,849
transformer with a point and the

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,310
assembly of points and then just simply

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,019
figuring out how long the result is the

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,430
Next Door transform I've penned

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:32,489
elsewhere but I'm sure you can imagine

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,890
it I bet by now you're a little bit

00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,170
surprised by how elegant this is shaping

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,000
up to be it really is the only correct

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,890
way to write code especially when you're

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,930
talking about speeds of 120 words a

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,299
minute if you're really good at English

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,069
and maths and you work really hard maybe

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,129
you two one day will be able to do this

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:53,760
but you know or not just don't nag me

00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:58,620
with any questions so next we're going

00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:04,470
to simply perform the obvious exam to

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:07,200
see if the rating is true or 3 and if so

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:11,010
simply return it and hail it as a

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,269
bastion of truth and that's it IIF so

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,739
when you're trying this at home you'll

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,319
just need to set up one of these cameras

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,319
and run the standard command oh and hire

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,030
a compiler of course so did anyone not

00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:25,199
get any of that put up your hand so we

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:29,459
can all see look at you awkwardly so

00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,049
that was my coding demo how many people

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,040
feel confident they know what this code

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:37,079
does does anyone want to hazard a guess

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,790
no not even that even if you figured it

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,590
out I think you'll agree that was a

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,079
pretty terrible way of explaining it and

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,030
the purpose of that exercise was to try

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,530
to help you cast your mind back to the

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,299
time when you're an outsider to

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,000
functional programming the time before

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,949
you knew what all the jargon meant that

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,650
time wasn't actually all that long ago

00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:58,049
for me but even I still know that it's

00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,069
it's quite easy to forget sometimes what

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,979
it was like when you're on the other

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:04,440
side of that experience so let's do a

00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,459
bit of a retrospective sorry post-agile

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,019
people what worked well with that demo

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,780
well the code I showed actually does

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,359
work but everything else was pretty

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,729
terrible I think there was unexplained

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,979
jargon there was an assumption about

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:21,780
your ability based on your appearance

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:24,539
they were insults based on the

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,190
programming language that you like you

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,320
were primed to believe that what you

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,729
were seeing was going to be hard and you

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,650
won't even the opportunity to ask

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,990
at least not without being made to feel

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,939
a bit silly you weren't given any

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,770
resources for doing this in your own

00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:39,979
environment or anywhere to go for help

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,089
and you weren't given any context or

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,909
motivation to want to understand what

00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:47,460
was being communicated I could have told

00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:49,439
you I was writing a function to help

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,379
implement Conway's Game of Life which is

00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,360
a cellular automaton and explain that

00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,009
it's about cells or points that either

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,349
live or die over a number of iterations

00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:00,539
based on the a few rules around the

00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:02,279
state of neighboring cells could have

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:04,110
shown you this Wikipedia page to

00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,990
motivate the example and show you how

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,969
interesting the results could be could

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,069
have also told you that the syntax T

00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:12,930
line is a type of shorthand used by

00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:15,389
journalists but that was actually using

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,210
it to write JavaScript got some cruel an

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,499
unusual person I guess I could have

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,710
broken this down for you to give you

00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:27,599
some idea of how it works for example I

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:30,360
could have told you that this symbol

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:32,699
stands for cue or the word equal and the

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,379
little circle means s so together this

00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,499
means equals and this is in the code

00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:40,229
here here here double equals there and

00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:41,729
there she might have given you a little

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:44,580
bit more of a handle of what's going on

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:46,409
I could have built on some knowledge

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,810
that you already have by telling you

00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:50,909
that T line is based on handwritten

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,259
letters by showing you the alphabet here

00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:55,949
where you can kind of start to see that

00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:58,020
and most significantly I could have

00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,789
explained what I was saying in terms

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,819
that would be familiar to you rather

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:05,159
than unfamiliar ones I did none of this

00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,050
and although this example was quite

00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:08,759
extreme in that almost nothing I did

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,279
really helped serve the goal of helping

00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,809
you understand I hope that it reminds

00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,120
you of some more subtle but nonetheless

00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:17,039
off-putting examples of things you've

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,159
seen like this out in the real world the

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,120
world real F P world if so please keep

00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,889
those at the back of your mind

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,039
so I've titled this talk composing a

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:31,020
functional community for a few reasons

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:34,020
notice I'm talking about a e community

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,279
one I hate to disappoint you but I'm not

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,839
actually talking about the Erlang

00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,430
community I'm talking about the

00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,339
functional programming community more

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,080
broadly some of us may embrace different

00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,000
languages different syntaxes

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,830
different ways of working but I think

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,240
there is more to Unitas than there is to

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,960
divide us and we should be working

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,300
together

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,449
Erlang community elixir community

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,669
closure Pascal Scala regardless of the

00:06:54,449 --> 00:07:00,330
differences we want to refactor the FP

00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:02,219
community as a whole this community I'm

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,319
talking about building is a functional

00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:06,479
one functional of course in that it

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,729
embraces functional programming but also

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,250
one that works one that operates well

00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:14,690
and this functional community is

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,280
something we want to compose composing

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:20,039
functional composition and building up

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,020
results from smaller puzzle pieces you

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,129
need all those different pieces to get

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,110
the desired result

00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:27,210
I also want to point out that

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:30,139
composition is a deliberate act it

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:33,060
doesn't just happen without any thought

00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,610
so the key idea of this talk spoiler

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,469
alert sorry is that all of us are

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,169
responsible for sharing the land of love

00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:42,629
in an effective way to help compose a

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,789
bigger more diverse functional

00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,650
programming community and a few

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:50,099
questions naturally flow from that most

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:52,139
notably why and how given most of us

00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,969
here are likely programmers I've decided

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,740
to delve into that by looking at the

00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,960
core topic a bit like it were a coding

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,270
exercise so I'm going to give you a

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,370
little bit of background and then define

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,080
the problem we're facing discuss the

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,029
structure of a possible solution looking

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,940
at the inputs outputs and method and

00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:10,710
then finally finish up with an brief

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:16,889
chat about the often forgotten postlude

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:19,050
testing I'm truly honored to have been

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:21,509
given the opportunity to speak to you

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,009
here today given I've met very few of

00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:24,569
you in person before I thought I might

00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:27,089
start by giving you a little bit of

00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,560
background about who I am in the

00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,449
unlikely case that you can't pick my

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,940
accent I can confirm I'm from Australia

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:35,190
the land down under which seems to

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,919
inspire a lot of interesting animal and

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,599
insect memes like these ones I promise I

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,760
didn't bring any spiders or sharks or

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,229
drop bears with me and in defense of my

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,029
nation don't forget we have cute

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,890
creatures in Australia too although

00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,800
those koalas actually do have some

00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,750
pretty nasty claws on them so I'm an

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,370
Aussie and the reason I was able to

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,410
write the T line shorthand you just saw

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,320
a little bit of earlier is I am a former

00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,660
journalist

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,430
I worked in newspapers for a bit over

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,410
seven years before switching over to the

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,440
tea industry about three and a half

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:08,080
years ago I should probably admit up

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,660
front that Erlang isn't my functional

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,130
mother tongue so to speak I am actually

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,570
literally wearing my programming

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,000
language preference on my sleeve right

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,350
at this moment so you don't have to come

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,950
up and stare at me awkwardly later

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:23,020
here's a close-up so when high school

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,820
designer Philip Wadler saw me wearing

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,530
this he actually chastised me for not

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,170
including a QR code linking to the

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,700
source code so I apologize I did neglect

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,260
to do that but I can tell you that these

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,350
are sorting algorithms written in

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,120
Haskell so if I am a fan of high school

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,830
however I have made a habit of

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,440
participating in a variety of

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,870
programming communities FP focused and

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,910
otherwise so I'm a pretty familiar face

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,710
a variety of meetups and other events

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,470
for people who write high school Scala

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:54,250
Clojure Erlang JavaScript Ruby Python

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,170
and PHP among others my day job is

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,300
working for Red Hat as a developer

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,430
advocate for the open source open shift

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,840
platform as a service which requires me

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,760
to deal with all kinds of different

00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,230
developers who are interested in using

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,180
the platform and if you're interested in

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,210
that feel free to talk to me during the

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,980
rest of the conference i co-founded a

00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,510
group for women in FP called lambda

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,060
ladies which I'll talk a little bit more

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,740
about later and I'm a co-organizer of

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,150
the brisbane functional program group

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,580
which is a meetup group based in

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,320
Brisbane Australia with more than 500

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,640
members now we've really seen it start

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,690
to take off in the past couple of years

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:32,680
and finally as you may have gathered I'm

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:34,360
a woman this means I'm a member of an

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,250
underrepresented group in the FP

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,560
community and in the wider programming

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,420
community I heard a said once that every

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,430
woman in tech will eventually do a talk

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,990
of being a woman in tech and I'm not a

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,130
candidate to be a counterexample for

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,310
that I'm going to share some of my

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,900
personal experiences today to be honest

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,150
I'd rather be talking about something

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,190
more technical both because this is a

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,960
somewhat contentious area to address and

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,670
because I wish there weren't any need to

00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,550
talk about it I wish that there wasn't

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,950
an issue but there is and I think it's

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,410
an important important enough topic that

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:08,560
we spend some time and effort focusing

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,060
on it so that's a bit about who I am and

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,100
where I'm coming from but I

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,770
so I want to make it clear who and what

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,020
I am not so I'm not someone who can

00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,690
speak for all lambda ladies or all

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,850
female programmers or all women just one

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,710
person whether you like what I have to

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,810
say or you don't please don't assume

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,210
that any of my ideas presented today are

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,680
necessarily shared by anyone in any

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,500
group that with which I happen to

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,150
identify this is something that those

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,440
and underrepresented groups always have

00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,030
in the back of their minds that if we

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,160
make a mistake it's going to underscore

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,840
some negative stereotype and affect

00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,690
others from our group please don't fall

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,460
into that trap finally I want to make it

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,570
clear just because I happen to be

00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,160
someone who is part of an

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,380
underrepresented group in the FP

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,440
community this doesn't make me an expert

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,270
on diversity or community issues I don't

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,040
necessarily know all the relevant theory

00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,740
and I certainly don't have all the

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,420
answers I'm not here today to offer the

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,670
silver bullet for addressing community

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,370
issues I'm really just here to start a

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,050
conversation I have made an effort to

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,730
crowdsource some of the content I'm

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,800
presenting by talking to other people

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,840
and by doing some research into relevant

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,550
areas so that I can do my best to

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,740
reflect more than just my own thoughts

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,660
but dealing with these issues that we

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,490
have as a community is something that

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,040
needs to be done with healthy dialogue

00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:27,310
between many parties rather than anyone

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,290
put one person's take on it so with

00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,300
those preliminaries out of the way let's

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,130
move on

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,720
just like with any technical issue we

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,390
can't tackle a problem

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,460
unless we first understand what it is so

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,670
let's ravely stare this issue in the

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,440
face I want to look at two problems or

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,290
two different facets of the community

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,740
issue the first is that our community is

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,810
not as big as it could or should be

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,520
functional programming is awesome it has

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,170
elegant solutions for dealing with

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,330
today's computing environments and the

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,640
need for concurrent distributed systems

00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,470
I don't need to convince you of that you

00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,770
know it especially as users of Erlang

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,300
and OTP FP has all this goodness and I

00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,790
think its popularity is on the rise

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,500
because of it but if we're honest we

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,060
have to admit it hasn't really hit the

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,520
big time yet and become a dominant

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,040
paradigm this is reflected in many

00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,840
places but just to give one example I

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,570
did a search recently on the stack

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,650
overflow job site which has almost 1,500

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,240
jobs listed

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,670
and of those there were just 12

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,100
mentioning erling or Haskell receive 14

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,290
mentions closure 8 and Scala a little

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,200
bit higher with 53 and this was in

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,839
contrast to Java with 532 mentions

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,620
python with around 300 and C Ruby in

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,660
c-sharp with around 250 now of course FP

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,700
isn't limited to particular languages so

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,220
that doesn't perfectly reflect are those

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,839
positions that embrace FP but I think

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,520
it's still a pretty good indicator that

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,440
there is work that can be done on this

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:58,450
front why should we bother well with a

00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,550
bigger FP community helping FP r to

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,339
become more mainstream they would likely

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,290
be more FP jobs that is more jobs that

00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:07,270
don't make us want to poke our eyes out

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,010
so we more chance of us getting to work

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,050
with code that we like and there will be

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,300
more people to share the workload of

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,550
creating awesome things with FP more

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,680
open source code more libraries perhaps

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,370
even more languages I would argue

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,010
strongly that this is a very good thing

00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:26,640
the second problem in our community is

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,330
that it's not as diverse as it should be

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,000
what does that mean

00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,190
what is diversity when you hear the word

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,990
diversity in tech sometimes it's used in

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,570
a way as if it's synonymous with gender

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,000
diversity that is one type of diversity

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,890
but it is only one diversity is about

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,290
including people of all kinds and

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,140
categories here are just a few of the

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,580
groups that are included that in that

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,140
gender diversity is there but I'd like

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,180
to point out that it means more than

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,830
just the lack of women gender diversity

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,400
also encompasses people who are

00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,560
genderqueer

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,140
a gender non gender conforming and a

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,970
fluid gender among other things the

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,589
aspect of diversity I'm going to mainly

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,660
focus on in this talk is the lack of

00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:06,760
women in our community as it's the area

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,529
I'm most qualified to speak about but

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,660
many points will apply as well to other

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,070
types of diversity and the conversation

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,680
that we have around this as a community

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,900
must be broader than that if you want a

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,730
good general primer on diversity I

00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,410
recommend watching a straightens

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,230
programming diversity talk which will be

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,910
linked to in my references something I

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,580
do want to mention which at which Ash

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,830
sites in a talk is that marginalizing

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,100
people based on group stereotypes is

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,720
something we're all susceptible to doing

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,400
you might think that you're a logical

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,390
rational person and you would never

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,890
treat someone different

00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,160
because of one of these characteristics

00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:44,650
well consider this there was a study

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,750
done on hiring for a job in academic

00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,700
science for a laboratory manager manager

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,350
position and there were two applications

00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,970
that the people running the study used

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,670
and they were identical the only

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,820
difference was that they had a male or a

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,590
female name and the science faculty

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,120
members who received these applications

00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,880
who no doubt would think themselves

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,530
logical rational people just like us

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,180
rated the male applicant are

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,490
significantly more competent and

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,560
horrible than the identical female

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,870
applicant and they said they give the

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,720
male a higher starting salary and more

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,460
career mentoring interestingly the

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,440
gender of the faculty members who are

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,630
doing these ratings did not affect the

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,430
responses males and females rating these

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,620
candidates were equally likely to

00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,380
exhibit bias against the female student

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,000
so bias can be really subtle and we can

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,310
have biases even against people from

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,390
groups - we - which we ourselves belong

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:39,130
none of us are above this so to homed in

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,870
on the lack of women now how are we

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:43,390
going with gender diversity in the IT

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:46,930
community generally well I have a few

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:49,420
stats so back in the mid 80s about 37%

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,190
of computer science undergrad degrees in

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:55,570
the US were rewarded to women compared

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:58,420
to just 18% in 2010 again in the late

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:01,620
80s 42% of us software developers were

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,290
women whereas today it's around 20%

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,640
there was a 2013 survey around free and

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,800
open source software and it found that

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,810
women make up about 11% of the

00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,850
open-source community and this is

00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,380
actually a rise on what the previous

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:17,890
survey found the previous survey was

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,690
more around two to three percent are

00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,510
those some stats released by Google just

00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:24,640
last couple of weeks and they showed

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,530
that globally only amongst their

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,380
technical employees they were just 17%

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:31,210
women and I might mention too that the

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,280
racial statistics that they showed as

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,530
well were actually even worse sure only

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,830
for the US but again other big issues

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,480
there - not only do we have a problem

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,920
with getting women into the industry of

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,620
a problem with them leaving the industry

00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,780
so one study found that 41% of technical

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,030
women are gone after 10 years and 56%

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,110
after 10 to 20 just more than double the

00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,360
quit rate for men

00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,090
and finally I might mention there was a

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,620
study that showed by surveying all the

00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,660
other research that is done that there

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,000
is no biological reason why women should

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,620
perform worse than men at mathematical

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,600
tasks so you often hear this old

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,100
chestnut it's just simply not true

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,750
that's not the reason for these kind of

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,730
stats so that's women in IT generally

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,490
what about women in functional

00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:18,590
programming specifically as far as I

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,630
know we have no official statistics on

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:23,090
this but anecdotally it would seem that

00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,740
the percentage of women in FP is far

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:28,010
worse than even the percentage of women

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,929
in IT generally one illustration of this

00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,820
from my own experience I was at the GAO

00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:35,120
lambda jam conference in Brisbane last

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,860
year I walked up to get my lanyard and

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,450
my t-shirt and someone I'd never met

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,400
before handed them to me without me

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,440
saying the word they could do that

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,230
because out of 120 our delegates I was

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,049
the only one now that's a bit of a perk

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,240
I suppose to be instantly recognized but

00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:51,470
it's one I'd gladly give up and it was a

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,750
bit heartening to see that at this

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,010
year's event the same event I was not

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,070
the only one although there was still

00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,900
only a handful of us and I might be all

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,820
the way over in Australia but I have

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,370
reason to believe that it's not just me

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,169
experiencing this I spoken with members

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,549
of lambda ladies from many places in the

00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:10,010
world and they to agree that the

00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:12,500
percentage of women in FP is far worse

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:15,919
than NIT generally so I have a few

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,970
snippets of their responses so one says

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,130
yes women are definitely

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,870
underrepresented in FP based of their uh

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,790
based on their observations and

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,910
conferences in Europe in Europe and in

00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,950
the US another says that at a particular

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,690
London FP language meetup group they

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,370
went and out of a hundred attendees they

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,500
think they were the only woman there and

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,660
she says I've never actually felt

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,030
acutely out of place in an FP community

00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,790
until then and finally lest you think

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:42,500
this is only other languages one person

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,559
says in the Erlang community in which I

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,770
know there is a fast under over under

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,350
representation of women so we're not as

00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:54,350
diverse as we should be as a community

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:56,540
why do we care I think we should care

00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,429
because we write programs for the whole

00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,809
population and we should have a fair

00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:02,630
representation of that population

00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:03,380
creating them the technology we produce

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,360
has the

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,920
power to shape our world and our future

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,350
and we want it to be shaped in a way

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,410
that reflects the interests of all not

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,780
just an empowered few this alone I think

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,400
should be enough reason to care but if

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,310
you don't find that convincing consider

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,290
this also studies have shown that having

00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,150
a more diverse workforce leads to more

00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,460
innovation better performance in the

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:27,170
marketplace and increased profits and

00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,410
there is a wealth of research to support

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,300
this but here just a couple of findings

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:34,700
one study found that teams comprising

00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,490
women and men produce IT patents that

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,440
decided 26 to 42 percent more often than

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,570
the norm for similar sorts of patents

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,220
and another study found that companies

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,290
with diversity in leadership and says

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,050
all types of diversity now were more in

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:50,420
a roof and outperformed others employees

00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:52,250
at these companies were 45% more likely

00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,440
to report market share growth over the

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,820
previous year and 70% more likely to

00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,590
report that the firm captured a new

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:02,530
market why is this people with different

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,510
experiences have different perspectives

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:07,370
sometimes it just takes one key insight

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:10,070
to open up a whole new suite of

00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,650
potential applications I saw an example

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,360
of this just a couple of weeks ago as a

00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,400
developer I have this problem where I

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,610
find it really hard to resist buying

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,130
shiny new things with an API and as such

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:24,140
last year I ended up buying a string of

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,120
ossie designs intelligent Christmas

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,320
lights called holiday but I hadn't

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,600
really found much use for them since

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,250
Christmas time so I decided to take them

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,190
along to a weekend Hut retreat a few

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,750
weeks ago called can't yes so what do

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,930
you do with a string of programmable

00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:41,180
lights and there they are there yeah

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:43,280
well before long so in a camp had a key

00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,290
insight that opened up a new world of

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,530
possibilities they decided to arrange

00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:50,540
them as a grid before long there was a

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,310
camp up to do countdowns wonderful

00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,900
scrolling text an app that would display

00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,910
flags of the world based on Twitter

00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,370
hashtags and even a snake game which is

00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,180
what you can see then I could have got

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,910
in on the action too

00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,650
I created a node.js app on openshift to

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,440
show the output for the game of life

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:08,900
which I've embedded here so it enables

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,660
people to do different seed patterns and

00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:14,420
then see the effects both here and up on

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,770
what was the big screen 7x7 res for the

00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,390
win

00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,700
so this may not have been the most

00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:22,040
innovative idea ever thinking inside the

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,470
box but it's something I hadn't thought

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,929
of on my own having diversity of

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,000
perspective makes these aha moments more

00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,970
likely to happen and when they do the

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,400
whole group benefits so why is our

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,110
community not as big or diverse as we'd

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,780
like it to be why do we have this

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,340
problem I started to ask members of

00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,350
lamda ladies why they thought there was

00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,600
an issue particularly with regards to

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,400
attracting women they had a whole lot of

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,270
different ideas but there were three

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,429
kind of main threads to them firstly FB

00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,860
has an image problem that turns people

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,390
away this was reiterated over and over

00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,660
in the responses I got and here are a

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:02,510
few snippets they use words like deeply

00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,580
academic vein of elitism a sense of

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,860
protectiveness Clubhouse science style

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,820
and a culture of intellectual

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,300
territoriality

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:13,040
that's unfriendly to outsiders someone

00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,140
else mentions the whole neckbeard beard

00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,350
thing and says how unappealing that is

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,970
both to men and women and finally since

00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,220
FP tends to be sold in a hyper

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,450
intellectualized manner this evokes the

00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,500
math is hard brand of

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,750
anti-intellectualism

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,670
it has a differentially powerful impact

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,130
on women due to the way we gender the

00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,570
sciences that is FP propaganda has a

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,700
habit of taking the things which cause

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,290
women to be underrepresented in stem at

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,750
science technology engineering and math

00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:42,170
generally and then cranking them up to

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:44,240
11 so for anyone wondering what on earth

00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,559
these quotes could be referring to let

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,410
me give you a bit more of a concrete

00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:50,210
example I'm sure many of you have seen

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,640
this t-shirt before by all means

00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:56,300
it's a pretty funny slogan to NFP and

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,950
I've FP Insider who understands it but

00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,690
for outsiders this kind of thing

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,380
perpetuates the image of functional

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:05,390
programming as inaccessible and academic

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,620
let me be clear on this point promoting

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,170
this kind of image to the wider

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,460
community to keep FP exclusive by

00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,830
deliberately making the barriers to

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,630
entry high that doesn't make a super

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,780
smart coding ninjas that just makes us

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,970
douchebags this is underscored by the

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,190
second theme I saw running through the

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,919
responses but the functional programming

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,140
community can at times be unwelcoming to

00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,120
newcomers and here again some snippets

00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,530
that reflect that so one

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,600
person says that the meetups have been

00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,120
going to the members tried to make the

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,650
titles of the talks inaccessible and

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,240
they actually kind of saw that as a

00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,220
barrier to entry that they wanted

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,840
another says there were no women there

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,090
that was bizarre and made me feel very

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,980
uncomfortable I'd go to conferences and

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,510
literally no one would talk to me unless

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,660
I was very forward and grab people's

00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,670
attention someone else says this simply

00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,530
always too much showing off and never

00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:57,080
enough treating people with respect and

00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,960
finally countless minor jokes were told

00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,300
to be honest I felt pretty convicted

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,460
conflicted after that evening on the one

00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,380
hand I really enjoyed the talks on the

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:10,640
other I felt completely disassociated

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:13,070
with the community itself so finally

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,770
there was one more theme that I noticed

00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:20,540
Chazz it was a lack of support for

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:21,710
beginners or learners so one person just

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,480
says this right out they are not

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,830
welcoming or encouraging to beginners

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,540
despite what many of them say they're

00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,600
the nerdiest of the Nerds and on some

00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,130
level they want to keep it that way and

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,929
now that person talks about the amount

00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,100
of privilege and luck it took them just

00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:35,630
to get to the point where they

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,700
discovered functional programming and

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,170
then after that adding on all the issues

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,690
about maintaining involvement in the

00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,730
community and another says most of the

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,470
inroads seem to be academic and require

00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,600
a great deal of proactiveness which

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,670
takes confidence and importantly the

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,220
privilege for someone to be willing to

00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:54,559
mentor you now keep in mind too that

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,120
these snippets come from women who are

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,440
in the functional programming community

00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,150
these are the ones who managed to

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,740
overcome that the barrier the barriers

00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,540
that they're talking about at least for

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,710
now people leaving the community because

00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,290
I've had enough of this is another

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,730
dimension of the problem one respondent

00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,470
made the point and it's an excellent one

00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,760
but really the people we should be

00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,230
talking to about why they're not in the

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,020
community other people who aren't in the

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,130
community I suspect that their answers

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,580
would reflect a lot of what we've seen

00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,580
here

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:28,710
so we have a problem a community is not

00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:31,409
as big or diverse as we would like how

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:33,000
can we solve it I know sometimes you

00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:34,919
look at a kind of social problem like

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,019
this and it just seems huge and unwieldy

00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,870
can feel like you don't even know where

00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:42,240
to start as I said earlier I can't offer

00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,830
definitive answers but just as if we

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,539
were writing some program I think there

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,580
is some value in considering our

00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,230
function signature our inputs and

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:54,000
outputs before we look at a proposed

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:56,460
method so firstly inputs the inputs were

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,110
talking about in this case are people in

00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,429
growing our community we really need to

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,440
reach out to a number of different

00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:03,840
groups this includes those who have a

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,360
program before at all and those who have

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,950
but aren't actually doing FP and I think

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,720
for FP particularly the difference

00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,370
between the way we educate and reach out

00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,870
to people who have prior exposure to

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,600
programming versus those who don't is

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:18,659
quite stuck and community growth isn't

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,909
all about quantity either its quality to

00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:22,440
is sometimes forgotten that the target

00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:25,110
of our efforts should include members of

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,669
our own community present and past we

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,159
need to make sure we're both attracting

00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:30,720
new people and retaining the ones we

00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,100
have by making sure we're not burning

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,860
them out and that they have the support

00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,659
they need we may want to reach out to

00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,799
those who are no longer active to see if

00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:40,379
there's anything we can do to help them

00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,850
back into the fold and of course within

00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:43,139
these three broad groups there are many

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,299
subcategories we might want to think

00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:47,220
about using different approaches for for

00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:49,679
example children or people who are

00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,360
vision impaired it's important that we

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,460
consider who we're targeting with any

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,500
outreach efforts and tailor what we do

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,799
accordingly we can't expect the same

00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,809
approach to work for everyone

00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:03,090
so these inputs cover who are targeting

00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:05,399
with our outreach but what about the

00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,019
people doing the outreach work who is

00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:09,389
responsible for growing our community

00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:11,730
this is sometimes overlooked so I wanted

00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:16,649
to hear this point loud and clear you

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:18,929
are I am all of us are it is not the job

00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:20,779
of the minorities within a community to

00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:23,340
improve the diversity of the community

00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:25,639
putting the burden of this on them is

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,350
unfair and only exacerbates the problem

00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:30,179
if women for example are expected to be

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:32,369
the only ones spending time going around

00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:34,200
and running special outreach events and

00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:35,640
doing other things to attract women that

00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,560
is less time that they have to

00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,020
encoding and actually improving their FP

00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,030
skills to put somebody at disadvantage

00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,070
it is everyone's job to help grow the

00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:46,110
community let's not burn out certain

00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,750
people with the responsibility you don't

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,430
get to say it's not my problem if you're

00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:54,930
a part of this community then it's as

00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:57,390
much your problem as anyone elses next

00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,100
up what outputs do we expect to see from

00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,660
what we do what would it mean to be

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,380
kicking goals in the community growth

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,230
arena

00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,750
I think this flows naturally from what I

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:09,150
talked about earlier we want to see a

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,560
bigger community so more people popping

00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,300
out at the end of that process as

00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,520
members of our community and we want

00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,550
greater diversity in those members that

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,800
we see and we also want it to be as we

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,540
said a functional community want those

00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,640
members to be happy people who haven't

00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,990
been lunch with all the responsibilities

00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,440
and are actually able to focus on

00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,760
growing their knowledge of FP that is

00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,980
going to help us reach our goals of

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,870
making FP more mainstream driving

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,600
innovation creating more jobs and all

00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:38,550
that good stuff so we've got our

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,690
function signature down what are we

00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:42,390
actually going to do to turn those

00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,920
inputs into the outputs how can we break

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,630
this problem down into smaller more

00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,540
manageable pieces that can be composed

00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:50,340
to serve our end goal this of course is

00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,140
the tough part there are a lot of

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,820
different ways we could tackle this I

00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,010
just want to talk about three main

00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,930
themes connected to my own experience

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:01,020
and the three reasons behind the problem

00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:03,630
that I talked about earlier so when I go

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,400
around talking about FP and mention the

00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,530
lack of women sometimes I get the

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,140
question well how did you get it into FP

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,940
then you know what are you doing here

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,530
when I reflect on this there are kind of

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,330
three main catalysts I can identify for

00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:18,150
why I am here today as a member of the

00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:21,120
FP community I first became interested

00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,920
in FP in university thanks to one very

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,860
passionate professor to whom I'll always

00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,390
be grateful you see at my university the

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,980
only course that covered different

00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,570
programming paradigms such as logic and

00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,160
functional programming have been removed

00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,860
from the curriculum by the time I came

00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,750
to study there this professor though was

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,150
so passionate about the need to educate

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,710
students about these things that he

00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:43,110
offered to teach parts of the course to

00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:46,020
students in his own time in the library

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:47,790
from secret sessions so I went along to

00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,080
these secret sessions in the library and

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,300
learn about Haskell

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,920
Lisp and all these good things although

00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,360
I didn't really learn I didn't really

00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,130
write a whole lot of code during these

00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,170
sessions I was influenced by the

00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,790
professor's passion for this area and

00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,580
the many many elegant functional

00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:04,800
solutions to problems that he showed us

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,630
he gave us an education in FP but most

00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,300
importantly it was an education that

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,770
provided motivation which is the first

00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,840
of a three faint themes I want to look

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:15,690
at it gave me a reason to want to learn

00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,520
more about FP in the future and this

00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,720
story isn't unique to me actually just

00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,400
last night I was talking to another

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,750
conference attendee who said the reason

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,760
that they are in Erlang is because they

00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:27,360
had a professor that taught a course in

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,560
their own time on early so no these kind

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,920
of people are around and that passion

00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,420
it's really quite powerful I think so

00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,610
after I'd finished university and

00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,350
entered the workforce I decided to go

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,360
along to the local functional group I

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,370
was sufficiently interested and I have

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,310
to say the first time there was pretty

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:46,050
uncomfortable when I walked in I felt

00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,160
like people would look at me as if I'd

00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,310
wandered into the wrong room

00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,260
I felt very intimidated when the speaker

00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,090
asked questions like put your hand up if

00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,470
you know what a closure is just still a

00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,230
bit of a fuzzy concept for me at the

00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:00,660
time the dilemma was putting my hand up

00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,400
would be a confirmation to those around

00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,410
me that I didn't also not putting my

00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,210
hand up would be a confirmation that I

00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:08,370
didn't belong in that room but putting

00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:10,320
it up meant I might be called along upon

00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:12,900
to explain the concept which was quite

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,030
terrifying I probably only understood

00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,310
about 10% of the talk that I saw

00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:19,350
although luckily in that 10% there was a

00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,940
discussion of the maybe data type and

00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,650
some of my colleagues at work had just

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,750
introduced an optional jobs have been

00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,520
our Java so I actually saw something

00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,310
that was immediately useful and which

00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,050
did help to motivate me to return

00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:33,030
ultimately though if the only exposure I

00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:35,040
had to functional programming was that

00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,870
that meetup group I'm not sure I would

00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,090
still be here and still be part of this

00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:42,630
community today because it wasn't a safe

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,190
friendly place to learn for me the

00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,470
breakthrough for me came when I was

00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,940
invited to join a small study group that

00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:51,750
was going through the learn your Haskell

00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,060
book just meeting once a week it was I

00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:56,190
was undoubtedly the least experienced

00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,080
program in the group but it didn't

00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,690
matter we were all new to Haskell and

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,419
everyone's ideas were valued there we

00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,879
all took turns leading the group

00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:07,249
there was no there was no expert we were

00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:09,259
a group of equals so we worked our way

00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:11,359
through the entire book together over

00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:12,799
the course of about six months and it

00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,710
was exactly what I needed to get up to

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,259
speed it was a safe space for me to

00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:21,499
learn and that's the second theme I want

00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:23,239
to talk about safe spaces so at the end

00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,639
of the study group I had a reasonable

00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:27,169
handle on FP and Haskell basics but I

00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:29,629
also knew there was a huge amount I

00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:31,220
still had to learn so for that I kept

00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:33,559
attending the local functional group and

00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:36,289
there I found two people who really

00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,330
helped me along my along the way the

00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:39,889
first of those is someone whose name you

00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,739
might know because he's been part of the

00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:44,090
Erlang community and that's AJ Reeves

00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:46,009
O'Jays contribution to my journey is

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,289
just that he was always friendly and

00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:49,669
encouraging while others wouldn't say

00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:51,590
anything to me when I was new to the

00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:53,720
group Oh J always made an effort to come

00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,580
up and say hello and introduce me to

00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,309
other people it's a very simple thing

00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,440
but it made a huge difference it's also

00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:01,970
just always encouraging when I felt

00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,190
overwhelmed by how much I had to learn

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:07,159
he always seemed to be there to give me

00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,750
the boost that I needed another person

00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:10,309
that's been significant for me is Toni

00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,859
Morris who again is someone you may have

00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:15,169
heard of I refer to Tony as brisbin's

00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:17,359
functional programming guru he really

00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:19,339
knows his stuff and importantly his door

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,470
is always open I knew I could always go

00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:23,059
and ask him to look over my code or

00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,440
explain what something meant and he

00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:26,179
would make himself available to do it

00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,859
and this has been really important for

00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,319
me and my growth as a functional program

00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:32,510
and it's also given me the reassurance I

00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:34,819
needed to start to step out and do some

00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,919
presentations to help other people come

00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:38,990
more up to speed with FP I knew that if

00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:40,399
I showed Toni my material first he would

00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,349
pull me up on anything that wasn't quite

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,960
right which gave me the confidence to be

00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:48,020
able to go out there even though I'm

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,700
certainly no expert so AJ and Toni have

00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,500
both been important figures on my

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,809
journey because they have served as

00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,540
mentors and that's the third theme I

00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:59,150
want to talk about mentoring so that's

00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,770
my story and based on that I want to

00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,839
talk about those three areas that I

00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,089
think we can work on to grow our

00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:06,890
functional programming community

00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:09,740
education providing motivation creating

00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:11,270
safe spaces and mentoring I think all of

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,549
these are important if we want people

00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,960
who are currently outside us to become

00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:16,400
productive happy members of the

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,140
community

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,610
so firstly let's have a look at the

00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,710
details of how we can implement a

00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:25,160
solution for education providing

00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:27,290
motivation this part of the solution I

00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,880
think we can use to help counter the FP

00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,860
image problem I mentioned earlier

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,650
cutting through all those misconceptions

00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:36,740
about our craft being academic and elite

00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:40,010
and whatnot so let's consider the inputs

00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,350
to this method there are a few firstly

00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,820
we want to educate beginners and this

00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,280
means we need to create beginner

00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:48,620
friendly content this is easier said

00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,210
than done I said at the start of my talk

00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,010
that it's it's easy to forget the

00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,330
struggles you face there's an FP inside

00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,520
I once you're on the other side of that

00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,840
I think it's also really easy to forget

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,570
all the little things that you had to

00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,280
learn along the way and the way this

00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:03,130
manifests is that when you then come to

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,070
teach someone else you often skip steps

00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:08,390
that seem just so obvious to you now so

00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,070
one classic example I have of that is

00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:11,960
when I was teaching a workshop to

00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:14,210
teenage girls teaching them how to use

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,310
the terminal I thought I'd explained it

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,250
adequately but as I went around the room

00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:21,140
I saw some girls and they were they were

00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,780
there scrolling up in their terminal

00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:25,640
history trying to change things and I

00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,350
realized in that moment that you know

00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,270
I'd obviously skipped over something

00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,460
quite core to how one user terminal

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:34,250
users eternal because it just seems so

00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:37,100
obvious and natural to me but of course

00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,720
it wasn't obvious or natural to them now

00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,920
we have to be very mindful this kind of

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,040
thing when we're trying to educate

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,110
beginners a second group we want to

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,630
reach out and educate about people in FP

00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:50,420
is those in underrepresented groups but

00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,970
how do we do that in my experience the

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,370
answer to this is pretty simple you

00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:57,410
invite them you ask them there's a

00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:59,090
functional programming course run by a

00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,830
company in Australia called NICTA and

00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:02,930
they ran it in Brisbane earlier this

00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:05,480
year and not a single woman applied to

00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,890
attend or came along the organizers

00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,750
weren't very happy with that so they

00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:10,460
reached out to me and we decided to run

00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,840
the course again in Brisbane but this

00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,970
time we called it the lambda lady's

00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,890
nectar course and we specifically

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:18,260
invited women to come along even though

00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,970
we also still allowed men to apply the

00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,100
result was that the participants in the

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:24,530
course ended up being about 60% women

00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,080
was exactly the same course material as

00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,490
as has been run before the difference in

00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,950
the demographic was just due to the way

00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,690
we advertised it we just

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,520
promoted it in all the different women's

00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,980
in tech groups that we had locally and

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,290
also that we had a woman on board to

00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,910
help teach it myself and we found the

00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,160
women who attended it equally as well as

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,599
the men here's one comment from one of

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,760
the women that I found really

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,869
encouraging she says I think a lot of

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,339
people are scared of functional

00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:50,260
programming it's definitely a barrier

00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:52,060
but I think it was helpful that women

00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,560
was specifically invited to this and she

00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,000
says I feel like I have a decent grasp

00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,690
on one ends now I'm wondering what all

00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,530
the fuss is about

00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:01,540
just always nice to see the last input I

00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:04,329
want to mention is people from other

00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,650
programming language communities and I

00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:07,000
think we should definitely reach out to

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,440
people from other programming language

00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,089
communities but I also think we can

00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,390
learn a lot from them and their

00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:14,800
approaches to education rails girls and

00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,690
rails bridge for example are two

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,030
fantastic efforts to attract more people

00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,579
to rails that we can learn from I think

00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,440
rails girls does a really good job of

00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:25,480
very quickly getting people up to speed

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,240
and giving them that motivation to keep

00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,609
learning so we run rails girls weekends

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,380
in Brisbane twice now I took part of

00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:34,810
those because I believe it's part of my

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,819
job to support all efforts to increase

00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,470
diversity and the events I think we're a

00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:40,180
resounding success we've already seen

00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,310
people who attended just those short

00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,579
weekend events now going on to actually

00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,599
get jobs as Ruby developers so someone

00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:48,970
the functional community have already

00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:50,530
started to copy this approach we now

00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,390
have some events such as closure bridge

00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,849
which we ran for the first time in

00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:56,530
Brisbane just a few weeks ago these sort

00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:58,510
of events I think really need our

00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,150
support but I also think there's plenty

00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,069
of room for more of them think we can

00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,450
also learned from the really friendly

00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,950
welcoming nature of a lot of other

00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,960
programming language communities I've

00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,450
experienced this in many communities

00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,490
including Ruby Python and JavaScript so

00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,319
at Camp Jas when I wrote that note up

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,119
for the game of life I struggled a bit

00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:17,710
because I don't do a lot of node and

00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,599
Java scripts in-home surprises me with

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,819
its return types and it's non-functional

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,380
way of doing some things but someone

00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,150
else from the camp sat down with me and

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,920
they went through every line of code I

00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,020
wrote with me and helped to explain some

00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,220
of the node idioms which I think was

00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,079
really helpful and it's just quite

00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,030
typical of that community and the

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,099
attitude they have it's very valuable

00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,480
when you're a newcomer to have that and

00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:40,930
I think this is something we should be

00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,700
known for - as a community taking part

00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,480
in that camp jace event was also really

00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,000
worthwhile

00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,160
it's just to actually genuinely have a

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,530
go and try to experience what these

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,030
people the JavaScript people are going

00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,430
through so I have a first-hand knowledge

00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,990
of that when you then come to try and

00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,550
talk about functional things I think

00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:59,650
sometimes we just come in and start

00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,240
criticizing the way that other language

00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,400
communities do things without first

00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,840
actually really trying to understand the

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,580
frustrations that they have and how

00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,350
things really work for them so I think

00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:13,480
it's quite useful to go through that

00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:15,310
experience so what are the outputs we

00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,770
want for our educational outreach I

00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,450
think there are two key things we want

00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,250
learning to take place we want to be

00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,080
able to set some learning goals and make

00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,090
sure participants rather than leaving

00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,580
frustrated and infused actually get

00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,350
there and reach them and secondly as

00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,550
I've already talked about we want our

00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,830
education to provide the necessary

00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,600
motivation for people to keep learning

00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:37,150
we're never going to be able to teach

00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,250
people everything about FP in a talk or

00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:42,160
workshop whether it's one hour or a day

00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:44,290
or a whole week even we but we can make

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,180
sure that we leave them with a hunger to

00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,970
want to learn more and to continue the

00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,850
journey so how do we actually go about

00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:53,770
this well from my experience teaching a

00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,510
few workshops and on functional

00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,770
programming I don't know the topics and

00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:59,980
some of the reading I've done I'd like

00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:01,630
to offer a few suggestions I think we

00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,910
need to really carefully consider our

00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:06,250
curricula and our pedagogy that's what

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:08,200
we teach and how we teach it and some

00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,970
general tips out off around that is that

00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,740
we always need to consider our audience

00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,720
and build on what they already know to

00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,340
do this you need to assess what they

00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,410
already know first rather than just

00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,570
charging in and inundating them with

00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:22,030
information and then set a series of

00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:23,800
small attainable goals leading up to

00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,480
your overall learning goal so that your

00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,420
students are buoyed by some success

00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,369
along the way I think one often

00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,710
forgotten aspect of how we teach is to

00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:33,970
use visual mediums there's certainly a

00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:35,140
lack of that in a lot of the material

00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:37,840
we've seen but it really helps to

00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,640
solidify knowledge and also as I was

00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,310
always taught as a journalist we need to

00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,470
keep a language simple words matter in

00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:47,200
teaching unexplained jargon can be

00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:49,869
really intimidating use unambiguous

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,410
simple language and explain every

00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:54,580
acronym or unfamiliar term break it down

00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:57,310
basically do the exact opposite of what

00:41:54,580 --> 00:42:00,050
I did in my demo at the start

00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:02,210
secondly language choice this is a

00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,710
pretty controversial subject I just want

00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,410
to look at a few points based on my

00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,970
reading what makes a good teaching

00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,350
language can be very different for what

00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,060
makes a good programming language

00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,920
generally and there are some evidence

00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,210
that the best language to use may

00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,920
actually depend on the cognitive

00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:17,600
characteristics of your students so

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,010
there may not be just one language that

00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,200
is always the best one to use for

00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:23,630
teaching and there's also some evidence

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,190
that syntax may matter there's a really

00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,320
interesting study that's linked to in my

00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,670
references you can read about that it

00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,770
didn't actually include a functional

00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,470
language but they found that students

00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,480
taught Java or Perl performed on par

00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:37,550
with those taught language with randomly

00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,260
generated keywords whereas students

00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:42,290
taught Ruby or Python did better which

00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,730
is it's interesting I think those using

00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,010
the Erlang VM have a really great

00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,630
teaching option with elixir the gateway

00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,700
drug into the functional world as Dave

00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:52,370
Thomas has used it I'd love to see how

00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,480
successful efforts can be using that to

00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,830
teach functional programming going

00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,480
forward next I want to mention tooling

00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:02,090
this can be a real headache for

00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,890
beginners and it's often overlooked most

00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:06,080
professional programming tools are not

00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,760
designed with beginners in mind we have

00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,920
to make a concerted effort to explain

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,480
environment setup and tooling to novices

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,340
so they're not stuck with error messages

00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,560
that they have no idea how to address I

00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,660
think cloud computing can be really

00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,880
useful here we may be able to abstract

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,070
away some of the environment headache by

00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,320
hosting educational material in the

00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:25,970
cloud and I've tried this by using the

00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,140
openshift pass for some of my workshops

00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,060
and I found it to work really well

00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,360
especially with complete beginners to

00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:34,550
programming I think education can happen

00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,990
in many contexts but we've seen great

00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:38,570
success we make the effort to organize

00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,190
focused events like rails girls closure

00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,380
bridge and the NICTA workshop I

00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,730
mentioned earlier our local functional

00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,260
programming group has been running some

00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,550
hack nights where they're just

00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,080
experienced functional programmers

00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,790
available to help get beginners up to

00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,470
speed and help set up their environments

00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:54,050
and all that which has been really

00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:56,150
useful I think we really need to

00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,530
consider our onboarding processes from

00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,240
the point of view of a beginner as was

00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:01,790
pointed out by Dave Thomas and Jose over

00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,710
Lim and their Erlang factory keno so

00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:05,840
when the workshop is over people still

00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:08,060
need a path to follow to get themselves

00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,650
set up and delve into development I

00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,310
think we can definitely do a better job

00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,510
of this

00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,190
make sure there's plenty of good

00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,170
beginner-friendly content available to

00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:18,050
walk people around some of the potential

00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:20,690
stumbling blocks and finally it's my

00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:22,880
opinion that we will do a better job of

00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:25,220
attracting people to FP if we take a

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,140
positive approach you catch more flies

00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,020
with honey than you do vinegar as they

00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,940
say after one of my recent talks on FP

00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,950
in another language community one of the

00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,300
attendees tweeted they were interested

00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:37,580
in learning more and they said the

00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,370
following not starting with all your

00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,480
languages suck was pretty compelling I

00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:43,880
think that sums it up nicely

00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,620
let's tell others what FP has to offer

00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,350
rather than just going around telling

00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:50,330
them they're doing it wrong so that's a

00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:51,950
brief look at some of the details of a

00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,630
possible approach to education obviously

00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,460
there's a lot more that could be said

00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,260
about this area but hopefully that's

00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,990
just provided a little bit of food for

00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,930
thought next I want to talk about

00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:04,520
creating safe spaces this approach I

00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,900
think helps to address the problem of

00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,360
the community sometimes being

00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,530
unwelcoming this is really important for

00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,150
functional programming because

00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,800
functional programming is such a

00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:15,110
different way of looking at problems and

00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,610
even experienced programmers have to go

00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:18,010
through this period of adjustment when

00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:20,510
they feel like complete beginners again

00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:22,430
it's hard for everyone but it's

00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,290
particularly hard if you're from a group

00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,910
that happens to be a minority in the

00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,490
community when you're already battling

00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:29,330
all the things that go along with that

00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,430
so I think this is one of the big

00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:34,040
reasons for having a group like lambda

00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:35,570
ladies actually when I first had the

00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,490
crazy idea to start a group called

00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:39,830
lambda ladies I not actually met any

00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:41,300
other women in FP and I dismissed the

00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:43,250
thought because I was worried it would

00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,740
be a group of one and there would be no

00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:47,900
point I turned out to be very very wrong

00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:50,030
about a year after I first thought about

00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,590
that I decided would be cool to submit

00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:53,120
something on functional programming to

00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:55,130
the Grace Hopper celebration which is a

00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,690
large women's tech conference and I put

00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,090
the word out on Twitter for some other

00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,950
women in FP to collaborate with there

00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,230
ended up being five of us and that was

00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:05,630
for more women in FP then I never dealt

00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:07,820
with before so we submitted to the

00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:11,000
conference and ultimately a proposal was

00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:12,920
rejected however the process of working

00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,840
on the proposal together was a really

00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,880
positive one for all of us we never met

00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,830
in person but we developed a bond around

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,710
these shared experiences we found we had

00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,090
as women and FP and often the only women

00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,510
in our local functional programming

00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:26,420
groups

00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:28,369
so out of this camaraderie lambda ladies

00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,470
was born and far from being a group of

00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:33,170
one or a group of five it has grown to

00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:34,700
be a group of more than 200 members it's

00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,230
mostly an online group with most

00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,550
interaction taking place on Google

00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,320
Groups but there have been several

00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:42,109
real-life meetups these often happen

00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,910
around conferences the five of us who

00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:45,619
formed the group had already found our

00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:47,600
way into their feet community despite

00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:49,760
the hurdles but we were able to create a

00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,160
safe space for those who possibly

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,020
weren't there yet and the responses from

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,330
my lambda lady survey going to spell out

00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:58,310
the role of having such a group so one

00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,540
person says it's space we don't always

00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:01,430
have to be on your guard against

00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,310
harassment we don't have to worry about

00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,240
how you present yourself that femininity

00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:07,430
femininity will undermine your

00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,690
credibility or that asking stupid

00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,150
questions will affect the way people

00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:13,130
think of women as a whole just seeing

00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:16,640
other women is energizing one says and I

00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:18,290
certainly agree with that another makes

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,820
the point that it's important to

00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:22,280
understand that women create their own

00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:24,550
spaces to create tech because all the

00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,930
existing spaces are for men by default

00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:29,630
and now that says it makes them feel

00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:30,680
less isolated and finally on the point

00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,210
of whether or not this is about

00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,940
segregation which it certainly is not

00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:37,340
one says women's groups ultimately are

00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:39,230
not insular they exist to strengthen

00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:41,960
members resolve so that women can both

00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,970
achieve individual success and bring

00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,070
progress to the program community as a

00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:48,140
whole and that's certainly true this is

00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,460
not about separating in and having all

00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,100
the women over here and everyone else

00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,530
over there it's about giving women or

00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,300
any other group a safe space to be so

00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:59,920
that they can then come out and bring

00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,920
that success to the community as a whole

00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,600
so what are the inputs to this well I

00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,170
think it's just those who may not

00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:11,300
otherwise participate but also all of us

00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,369
because rather than having these safe

00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:15,380
spaces off to the side perhaps we can

00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:17,600
make the community as a whole a safer

00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,750
space for everyone and it takes all of

00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:23,330
us to achieve that here's a quote from

00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,590
Tim Chevalier on this point he says men

00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:26,660
seem to feel powerless to do anything

00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:28,850
about the state of affairs and yet they

00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,530
have power they can let men who make

00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,840
these comments know that sexism isn't

00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,670
okay and he says countering it requires

00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,070
courage and moral stamina it's work that

00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:37,580
largely needs to be done by men so again

00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,650
it's the

00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:41,480
all of everyone to make this community

00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,250
better for us as a whole and it's

00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:47,210
article linked to there is a great one

00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:49,100
if you haven't read it before what's the

00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,840
output of this we just want people who

00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,880
are comfortable to be able to focus on

00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,850
FP itself rather than all this other

00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:59,090
extraneous stuff that we just really is

00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,980
just getting in the way how do we do

00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:04,010
this well there's a few things that are

00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,810
useful one is codes of conduct and we

00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:07,580
saw this actually at lamda ladies there

00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:09,050
was a woman who was looking to learn a

00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,090
particular functional language I won't

00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:13,460
say which one and she found a mentor

00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:15,440
online was a guy and he introduced her

00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,510
to a particular IRC channel for that and

00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,120
there she was exposed to some really

00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:22,640
negative things there was sexist and

00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:25,040
homophobic language and she was not very

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,420
comfortable in this space so she came to

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,770
lamda ladies and you know she talked

00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,440
about this and what should she do she

00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,790
didn't want to lose the mentor but she

00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,710
was really feeling uncomfortable with

00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:35,900
this in the end she didn't have to do

00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:38,270
anything because the mentor realized

00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,860
what was going on was inappropriate talk

00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,960
to the people on the channel called them

00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,400
I find it and created a code of conduct

00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,860
for it so we saw a really good outcome

00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,360
there from people just been willing to

00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:50,330
stand up and call this stuff out when

00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:53,150
they see it and then providing a way a

00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:54,590
path for these things to be addressed in

00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:58,070
future when there is an appropriate

00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:59,870
behavior think using inclusive language

00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,640
is really important if you read that

00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:03,140
full a blog post from Tim chapelier

00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,210
you'll see it's actually sparked by a

00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,770
single line that someone said in the

00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,870
high school community that instantly

00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:11,240
made everyone in that room who was a

00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:12,920
woman feel like they were the other they

00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,080
were out of place and that it's just

00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,610
it's so easy to do it can just be you

00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,070
know a couple of words and you've done

00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:21,110
that so something to be really mindful

00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:24,800
for the words we speak do have great

00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:25,910
power and finally there's a few

00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,530
suggestions from the high school

00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:29,540
symposium where they talked a little bit

00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,250
about this issue last year and the way

00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:33,110
that people have been harmed in that

00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:35,050
community their suggestions were yes

00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:37,550
speaking up calling the stuff out

00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,780
listening to one another and the effect

00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:41,630
of the things that are going on

00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,740
supporting one another and taking care

00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:47,750
of ourselves so not letting people

00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:49,850
burnout shewing this stuff so the last

00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:51,079
thing i want to talk about in terms of

00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,209
the three themes

00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:54,559
is how we might address the problem of

00:50:53,209 --> 00:50:56,029
lack of support for people who are

00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,969
learning and I think that's through

00:50:56,029 --> 00:51:01,459
mentoring education isn't enough in

00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:03,140
isolation I went to a conference in New

00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:05,059
Zealand recently with Tony Morris to

00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:08,029
talk about monads and other principled

00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:09,680
things and afterwards I heard overheard

00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:10,489
someone saying well I still don't know

00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,529
what a monotheist

00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:14,359
and this can be a bit frustrating cuz

00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:16,190
you think well you just had it laid out

00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:18,529
like really clearly there were no

00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:20,509
analogies of what not but I think what

00:51:18,529 --> 00:51:22,339
they actually meant was I still don't

00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:24,890
know how I would sit down and apply this

00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:26,839
concept for myself and it's difficult to

00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:28,670
give people that in a talk or even a

00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:31,009
workshop they need to build up their

00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,450
intuition on their own but in doing that

00:51:31,009 --> 00:51:34,729
you want to make sure they're going down

00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:36,559
the right path and as they do they're

00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:38,989
going to have questions I think this is

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,369
where mentoring comes in helping to give

00:51:38,989 --> 00:51:42,229
some direction to the learning and

00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:45,289
encouragement and stepping in to provide

00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:48,289
assistance as necessary so who can do

00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:49,670
this mentoring well anyone who's one

00:51:48,289 --> 00:51:52,579
step ahead of the person that's being

00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:54,650
mentored recently at commit who's like a

00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:56,209
prolific high schooler came to Brisbane

00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,219
and everyone was kind of Anor in him he

00:51:56,209 --> 00:51:59,569
was this Oracle just everyone would come

00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:01,279
up and ask a question and be writing

00:51:59,569 --> 00:52:03,319
scribbling down formulas on the back of

00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:04,969
an envelope kind of thing and we're all

00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:07,190
so impressed by his formidable knowledge

00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:09,019
and then a week later I found myself at

00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:11,239
camp yes and people were coming up to me

00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:13,039
and they were asking about peeing in

00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:14,959
Monde ads and I found myself scribbling

00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:16,339
on the back of it envelope and writing

00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:19,039
formulas and things and I had this

00:52:16,339 --> 00:52:21,529
moment where I thought well to these

00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:24,289
people in this context I am like they'd

00:52:21,529 --> 00:52:25,999
commit even though I am no expert you

00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:28,279
don't have all that knowledge but you

00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:30,829
only need to be just that one little bit

00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:33,789
that one step ahead and you can fall

00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:37,130
into that role of being the mentor

00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:39,410
what's the output of this mentors become

00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:42,019
mentees become Mentors

00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:45,949
this is growing our community and just

00:52:42,019 --> 00:52:47,209
continuing that cycle how do we mentor I

00:52:45,949 --> 00:52:48,380
think it's pretty simple

00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:51,109
it's about being friendly and

00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:52,910
encouraging and really listening to what

00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:56,299
people are saying and just sharing your

00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,890
knowledge in that context so there are

00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:59,299
three areas I wanted to talk about but

00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,309
there are also some other suggestions

00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:03,289
from the lambda lady so I'll quickly

00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:04,400
show you a few more things that they

00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:06,440
said

00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,719
one said just getting rid of all the the

00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,640
FP propaganda and treating FP like any

00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,920
other paradigm something quite easy that

00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,509
we could tackle now that talks about the

00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,299
lack of mentor saying we should get more

00:53:14,509 --> 00:53:19,609
women featured on numberphile Haskell

00:53:17,299 --> 00:53:22,549
cast and what not outreach training

00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:25,400
scholarships for conferences also

00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:26,989
education not about FP but educating

00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,819
everyone about the ways that tech

00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:31,069
culture enforces power dynamics that

00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:33,049
disadvantage these groups that we've

00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:35,180
been talking about and reaching out to

00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:37,339
organizations that focus on improving

00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:39,739
the experiences of these people we're

00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:41,539
not experts necessarily on on diversity

00:53:39,739 --> 00:53:42,950
and codes of conduct and all these kinds

00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:44,719
of things but there are organizations

00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:47,869
that are and they're there and willing

00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:50,150
to help and finally if we can get a more

00:53:47,869 --> 00:53:52,579
open discussion of the phenomenon we can

00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:56,420
change it I think that's really key just

00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:58,249
having the conversation so the last area

00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:01,489
I wanted to talk about briefly is just

00:53:58,249 --> 00:54:03,289
testing I've mentioned along the way a

00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:05,089
lot of these things you know they're a

00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:06,469
little bit of guesswork don't really

00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:08,420
know what the numbers are for the FP

00:54:06,469 --> 00:54:09,859
community so why not actually do

00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,900
something about that we could do some

00:54:09,859 --> 00:54:13,249
kind of FP Community Survey to give us a

00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,440
benchmark so we can actually then

00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:17,660
measure the result of our efforts I

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,099
think we could probably do some work to

00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:21,349
assess the teaching tools that were

00:54:19,099 --> 00:54:23,269
using and how they affect beginners it

00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:25,099
may be that we need to develop some new

00:54:23,269 --> 00:54:27,229
tools we're not going to know that

00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:30,019
unless we take an Imperial cool approach

00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:32,299
to this and finally I think we really

00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:34,849
need to be open to feedback from outside

00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:36,859
the community it's hard to do but if we

00:54:34,849 --> 00:54:38,719
can find out why people from particular

00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:39,920
groups are saying that they're not in

00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:41,779
our community and they haven't felt

00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,549
welcome and we can listen to their

00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:47,749
stories that's really going to inform

00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:50,539
our efforts going forward so let's recap

00:54:47,749 --> 00:54:52,579
I say that the FP community has a

00:54:50,539 --> 00:54:55,099
problem and that it's not as big or

00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:58,069
diverse as it could or should be the

00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:59,900
percentage of women for example appears

00:54:58,069 --> 00:55:02,089
to be much worse than in the program

00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,009
community generally there are a number

00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:06,710
of reasons this might be I suggested

00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:08,599
that FPS negative image community that

00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:10,190
can sometimes be on welcoming and lack

00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:12,769
of support for learners can all play a

00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:14,299
part we considered how we might solve

00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:16,400
this problem looking at who we should

00:55:14,299 --> 00:55:17,430
reach out to and who is responsible for

00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,400
doing that outreach

00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:22,710
and that was all of us we looked at the

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,119
outputs we'd like to see or the goal of

00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:26,700
the community being bigger and more

00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,950
diverse without burning out individuals

00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:31,470
or failing to support the existing

00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,790
members of the community we looked at

00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:35,040
some possible methods for doing that

00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:37,109
education that provides motivation the

00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,510
creation of safe spaces and mentoring

00:55:37,109 --> 00:55:40,800
and finally we had a brief chat about

00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:43,440
how we might be able to test the

00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,849
effectiveness of our efforts at the

00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,800
start of this talk I showed you some

00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:48,300
code written in t line to help you

00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,300
remember what it was like when you are

00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:53,069
an FP outsider the code was part of an

00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,230
implementation of the game of life I

00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:56,940
wrote at Camp Jes to be displayed on a

00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,680
string of intelligent lights arranged in

00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,869
a grid thanks to the input from others

00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,579
at the camp may not have being the

00:56:00,869 --> 00:56:04,589
greatest innovation ever to think inside

00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:06,450
the square but it's a reminder that we

00:56:04,589 --> 00:56:08,730
need those light bulb moments to drive

00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:10,020
innovation but having a diverse array of

00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:12,809
voices in our company in the

00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:14,900
conversation helps to promote that I'd

00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:17,640
like to conclude by revisiting that up

00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:20,280
in the game of life little communities

00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,839
of live cells form but they also die off

00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,599
when there are too many as if by

00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,640
overpopulation new cells can be spawned

00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,220
but only when they have exactly three

00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,920
live neighbours what if we changed the

00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:34,079
rules of the game what if no cell died

00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,910
off due to overpopulation and any cell

00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,700
in contact with at least three live ones

00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:41,069
came to life or in other words what if

00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:43,109
we were able to retain all the

00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:46,160
switched-on people in a community and

00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:52,280
all clusters of members were able to

00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:57,940
attract new people well we get growth

00:56:52,280 --> 00:57:00,940
life and eventually world domination

00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:03,520
if we can attract more people reflecting

00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:06,130
greater diversity educate people create

00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,599
safe spaces and mentor them then the

00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,849
result of that is going to be a bigger

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,190
better community and that benefits all

00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:13,990
of us all of us are responsible for

00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:16,119
sharing the land of love in a positive

00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:18,250
effective way to help build this bigger

00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:21,160
more diverse functional programming

00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,539
community if you're interested and some

00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,280
of the references that I've mentioned

00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:26,740
and resources that you'll find them all

00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:30,400
here on my slides and you can find these

00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:32,589
slides at community code millicom i'm on

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,630
twitter on code miller and i'm just

00:57:32,589 --> 00:57:34,990
encourage you to keep the conversation

00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:37,680
going

00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,680
