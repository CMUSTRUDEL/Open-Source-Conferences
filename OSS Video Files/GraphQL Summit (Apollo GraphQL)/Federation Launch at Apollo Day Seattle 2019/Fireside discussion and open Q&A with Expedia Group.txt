all right this is the last bit so I want

00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,480
to keep it short and interactive and let

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,740
me introduce Shane who spoke earlier and

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,570
Dan burner who what's your title your

00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,090
he's in charge of a lot of stuff sakes

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,399
troublemaker you run the graph or I

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:29,149
don't know we've been working together

00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:31,640
for since late last year I guess Shane

00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:34,879
told that story how Expedia saw the

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,679
value of the graph really early built a

00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,289
lot of the graph management technology

00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,449
that we've been talking about same story

00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,910
a lot of what we've done is inspired by

00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:47,390
what we learned working with the team

00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:51,739
and it's just been a real privilege to

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:53,179
get a chance to collaborate I think Dan

00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:54,890
maybe if I can just put you on the spot

00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:57,679
for a minute or two and tell your piece

00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,359
of the story we've heard a lot about the

00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,780
technical side of this I think it might

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,460
be a nice capstone to hear from more of

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,990
a business perspective how do you see

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,650
the value and maybe a really practical

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,320
point is what led you to get behind a

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,670
project like this and push for you know

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,560
there's been a lot of engineers working

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,660
on this a lot of investment probably a

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,100
fair bit of risk in a lot of people's

00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,680
minds how did you approach that and what

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,450
what advice do you have for for the

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,780
teams here that are probably approaching

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,160
that conversation too thanks for the

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,840
intro and I just want to say at the

00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,760
outset that like it's so exciting to be

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,650
part this is you know this is the most

00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,270
graphic you'll enthused people have been

00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,190
around since the since the November

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:41,330
summit last year it's a lot of fun to

00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:43,250
feel the vibe I'm really enjoying it you

00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,680
know Spees been around a long time

00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,840
right we spun out of Microsoft billion

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,800
years ago and I was there near that

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,140
beginning and where you know we were

00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,970
around those of us when with the big

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,880
seller movement happen right so we were

00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,620
lucky with services and then all the

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,930
different clients so we you know so is a

00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,730
step up and then rest was a step up from

00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:08,989
these big giants you post bust model

00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:11,749
this we used to write when when we

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:12,590
started doing our PWA and we we really

00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:13,300
wanted have these very lightweight

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,740
client

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,600
and we wanted to push all this stuff

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,490
back the server and as Shane tells the

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,170
story really well like how are we gonna

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,960
scale this out across the size of our

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,610
company so when we looked at graph qls

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,000
sort of it just a much more generic way

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,170
of handling that problem I mean right

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,550
off the bat I mean and we're gonna touch

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,160
on this I bet as we just start to riff

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,830
on this but there's so many things that

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,690
start to happen that click into place

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,200
Matt's intro I thought was really good

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:45,730
but the one that every time it comes up

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,620
I think is underappreciated is when your

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,130
client code doesn't know where the data

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,170
is coming from all kinds of good things

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,060
start to happen because when you've got

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,490
you know even I'm sure convoy feels it's

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,320
at 20 services and six clients it's a

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,760
pain when you want to make a change and

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,100
somebody wants to version or some piece

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,900
of you know god help them they were

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,450
probably cloud native from day one we of

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,860
course were not so all of those services

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,660
think about them they're moving through

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,950
different incarnations they're changing

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,720
versions they're moving different

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,690
instances they have different region

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,739
strategies all that endpoint management

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,020
you know Jim worked in the mobile team

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,330
and like half of the work the mobile app

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,560
team would do had nothing to do with

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,450
creating experiences for customers

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,700
because they were just constantly

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,860
figuring out what API is they could call

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,570
onboarding of those api's managing them

00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,340
dealing with schema breaks the whole

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,560
nightmare and it just becomes it's not

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,060
fun right you're not developing stuff

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,430
for the customer there's a lot of

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,690
overhead so when we started to see these

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:46,360
things we realized that like that if we

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,550
didn't get our hands around not just the

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,709
tech right but how we would use this

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,260
tech to enable the customer experience

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,480
we wanted we were just gonna be in a

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,570
place there wasn't a lot of fun and you

00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,739
know you can grind away at a problem for

00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,390
a certain number of years and then it's

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,940
just tiring and at the scale of our

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,530
company we really saw an opportunity to

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,110
sort of lean into this and at the same

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,190
time we'd finished about a half dozen

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,870
years I don't know if I've even told you

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,660
this story we spent about a half dozen

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,370
years a while back really embracing

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,320
testing learning culture and that was a

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,180
huge deal for Expedia because before

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,170
that basically just the level of

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,300
hierarchy they

00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,950
you held decided if you got to control

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,200
the product experience

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,660
so the VPS and the senior directors they

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,310
defined what the products were and it's

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,380
that October theory and if they were

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,090
good we got great products if they

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,040
weren't so good we didn't get such great

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,110
products but we brought in a test and

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,150
learn culture and that just meant mass

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,550
experimentation lots of data which was

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,270
great but it also meant that everybody

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,800
started to do everything differently so

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,120
if we wanted to bring that we got is

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,380
those fragment experiences we got

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,730
experiences that were fundamentally

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,110
different across every team and then

00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,730
every team was trying to catch up so we

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,400
have a new great feature we want to add

00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,260
like multi room support so you can buy

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,380
multiple rooms as you go through because

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,640
you've got a big family okay

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,140
Android's got to do it iOS has got to do

00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,300
it the web's got to do it desktops got

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,640
to do it and it just got to be again I

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,410
mean I it's silly but it is it's not fun

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,850
you're not actually too low delivering

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,650
value and it's a big waste and you end

00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,150
up the solution that Expedia had was

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,050
well I know how it can fix that problem

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:22,780
we need to hire more people so we just

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,580
did that year after year after year and

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,190
teams go from seven hundred to two

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,930
thousand to three thousand and that's

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:33,040
just but that's just creating another

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,810
problem right it's just so so we all

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,700
that attention on the customer

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,070
experience came about the same time we

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,280
had this BFF experience with p2p way and

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,270
we saw that and at the same time I got

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,060
introduced one more part of the story

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:48,040
and then I'll wrap we also added an

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,810
design system the last year into our

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,250
front-end so we finally had a unified

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,780
design system that wanted to apply

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,480
so all these piece parts came together

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,100
and we realized you know what this if we

00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,070
put this together we actually have a

00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,960
tech strategy here that we can use to to

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,950
get a cohesive experience our usability

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,200
people were like you know we've been

00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,820
looking at this in the labs for years we

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,410
really want to create an experience it's

00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,270
not necessarily exactly the same and

00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,850
every touchpoint but it makes sense and

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,830
it's seamless so we did something that

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,540
you know big companies often don't do

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,310
which is we step back and we decided to

00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,250
really lean into this that we didn't

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,890
really want to do this as just one team

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,730
off in the corner that after we did our

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,260
POCs

00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,000
we went after the biggest part of our

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,920
business which is our lodging hotel

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,160
business to prove it out and then we

00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,080
went

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,759
with great support from our tech leaders

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,910
like we just decided to go across the

00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,830
whole side of the company and now the

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,680
challenge is and this is where maybe I

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:45,050
can feedback Federation at the

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,970
technology level is awesome man

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,099
Federation at the planning the design

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,930
the community level is the next level of

00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:52,729
challenge right because we don't as a

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,370
core team and I'm part of that core team

00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:57,080
we don't want to tell all the different

00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,090
teams how to do what they do right

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,190
because it doesn't scale it just doesn't

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,169
scale and again we're back to the hot

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,590
tore theory of like oh we know what's

00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:08,720
best so what we've been we've been about

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:12,919
what's top of mind for us is that how to

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,659
get the tech to solve some of those some

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,069
of those negatives and meds that the

00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:19,250
convoyed guide percenter which were

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:21,380
great into goods but then also to how to

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,940
work together in such a way that we can

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,610
start to work together on what is good

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,400
what is good in graphical design so for

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,090
us that the customer like really in our

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,069
past experiences kind of led us to to to

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,199
lean into this and in a really scalable

00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:37,969
way and the reason the partner should

00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,469
have happened was we had these big

00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:41,090
aspirations for how we were gonna take

00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:43,280
the work we had done in the hotel space

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,569
and spread it across the the whole

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,880
enterprise but we didn't have a real

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:49,699
plan for how we were gonna scale that up

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:53,180
and our backlog which is really his

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:54,620
backlog was big right we had we had done

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,300
our own schema stitcher but we hadn't

00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,900
done the schema validation we hadn't

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,400
done the registry stuff so again to the

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,990
point I think was James made it about

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,270
like every time you do a really cool

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,330
home-built tool Apollo comes along and

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,440
does a sort of a more robust version

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,419
that's just a win-win for the whole

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,300
community so it's a great partnership I

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,289
think between the open-source model and

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,840
you know commercial law where you guys

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:21,340
can can hired ads that we don't have to

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,960
so this long-winded way of saying that

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,610
kept our eye on the customer we looked

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,740
at our past at what had worked and what

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,139
didn't and this is where this is where

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,460
we're letting we're really excited just

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,800
just to go back to the first thing I

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,810
said just that separation of the

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,909
services and the clients we think if

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,409
only that happens even if our graph

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,480
wasn't that beautiful and it wasn't

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,610
perfectly

00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,860
you know orthogonal and clean if we can

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,930
keep those those Clanton services

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,610
separate it's gonna open up a whole

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,840
other future for us that we can use to

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:56,440
evolve and I think one quick thing you

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,910
had mentioned to me earlier today is the

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,160
important part I think you said was

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:04,360
getting to a graph getting to a point

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,490
where you had that decoupling whether it

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,680
was right in some like fundamental sense

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,270
or wrong was a lot less important and

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,050
the insight I think if I have this right

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:15,610
and I'm curious Shane your take too is

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,620
once you're there it's not so hard to

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,420
maneuver it's easy to change things it's

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,340
easy to add things and I think maybe one

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,920
of the biggest takeaways is and I think

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:28,020
what's behind the rapid rise of graph QL

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:32,890
is finally we have an API technology

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:35,380
that's agile like we have a way to talk

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,720
about the interface between systems that

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,540
doesn't immediately lock us into this

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,330
thing that you know demands 18 months a

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,940
design cycle and like measure 15 times

00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,200
before you cut lest you discover you're

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,910
gonna be there for a long time is that

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,560
do I have that right or think about it

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,270
you do it and then I'm gonna pass to

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,430
Shane for some real-world examples but

00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,590
it's like we started out so all of you

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,360
that haven't maybe gone some of you may

00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,400
have done have gone farther than we have

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,110
but we started out with this idea of

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,730
really being curators of the graph and

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,880
we wanted to bring everybody up to this

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,440
very very beautiful description and that

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,570
worked for some teams and other teams

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,190
all we did was just put them back to the

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,720
design cycle and they just looped and

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,550
they just looped and looped and they

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,500
never got any code out and we realized

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,820
oh this is not helpful so maybe Shane

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,080
you can share some examples of where

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,270
we've learned how to move toward

00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,370
evolution versus perfection yeah I mean

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,840
even just example I gave in my slides

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,810
that it's pretty a pretty good example

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,340
we actually had kind of similar logic to

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,870
these boolean checks right we were doing

00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,480
boolean checks in the client and we

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,820
realized that that's not working so the

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,370
way that we kind of just go about is we

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,260
add the new field for offer badge and

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,910
then we can just deprecated the client

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,350
where you deprecated the field and we

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,500
now that we have these metrics you can

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,870
actually go back and quickly know okay I

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,130
know today that there no one is no

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,950
longer using it so I can actually delete

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,090
weird

00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,980
okay decode instead of just trying to

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,450
like guess when you're maintaining it

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,130
right so it's that's kind of allow us to

00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,990
do these quicker iterations like we know

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,400
who's using the fields we can deprecated

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,900
them when you decorate something that

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,330
immediately is communicated out to the

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,280
all the clients using it so yeah that

00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,930
helps us evolve quickly yeah and the

00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,310
other thing is like so it's always

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,020
important to keep your eyes on the prize

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,210
so we're all like usually come from

00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,390
engineering backgrounds so we this ideal

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,950
beauty is such a sirens call but we had

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,480
a team just that just went through the

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,460
process and they like they had a summer

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,960
sale coming up in a big campaign and

00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,760
they're like we think we can add a whole

00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,050
nother thing finish our front of our

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,910
whole shopping path and get this thing

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,070
out here's our schema we're gonna ship

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,720
it in two weeks and we're like two weeks

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,920
you haven't even towed it against that

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,360
and you're giving us and there's what

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,640
kind of design cycle is that and we were

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,380
really like and the scheme it was pretty

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,840
deep and it wasn't just sort of shallow

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,310
as we like but they said like can we

00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,350
ship this and then we evolved it and

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,540
iterate it actually we said actually not

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,360
only yes do it go get your business goal

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,610
but you guys can be you can help us

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,820
practice these patterns of deprecation

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,020
because they're not like if you can

00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,340
speak to this but like I think it's

00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,500
important that we get good at that

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,910
yeah I graph pruning and of evolution

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,860
that was our we were thinking of it as

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,490
just right once but it's not work

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,090
principle

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,720
right yeah you have to be add yeah

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,870
awesome

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,620
well we have this is really the data

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:18,140
graph team at Expedia and I can make

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:21,950
stuff up as I go so I just want to open

00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,270
it up for questions what what can what

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:27,320
are people curious about or what can we

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:29,120
answer and maybe the easiest thing I

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,790
don't know if we have mics or I can just

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,460
repeat we have a mic coming all right

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,070
it's not that yeah I guess not yeah

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,980
[Music]

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,990
so I want to ask chain and

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,330
you mentioned that there are schema

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,060
review meetings for schema changes how

00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,720
often you run those meetings and what do

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,970
you do to balance the policing and

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:58,190
called on me of each team what is your

00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:00,530
plan to scale up the process oh I'll

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:04,520
start first with just how how do we

00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:06,740
initialize the schema review so we

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,480
currently help the teams or exist today

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,280
right we're not just going out and

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,800
creating brand new products we're

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,300
migrating existing teams to graph koala

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,160
and their existing products services

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,840
existing front ends so like Dan

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,960
mentioned we have this new idea of the

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,240
text strategy so what we do is we we

00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,070
currently talk to teams who are not on

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,660
the tech strategy and we just say hey

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,580
look this is the new thing going forward

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,170
we would like you to onboard and once

00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,820
they say ok we're gonna start this on

00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,920
boarding process that's when we say ok

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,020
here's how you do graph queue oh here's

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,840
our SDK use our template fork the

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,220
template and let's let's talk about we

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,840
know the technology of using graph

00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,850
killer but it's also first even before

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,190
you might even start doing writing in

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,020
code let's look at what your UI looks

00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,960
like today and let's talk about what a

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,550
schema might look like for that UI all

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,100
right we don't just start in that visual

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,710
appearance so we often start a sharable

00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,690
documentation a sharable Doc's so we can

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,430
all just like take screenshots of UI and

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,380
like right now right now next to it

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,180
write a little mock mock code for a

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,830
schema and that just kind of triggers

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,050
the process of like pushing people on

00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,270
board then once we say ok this kind of

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,590
looks semi good go ahead continue doing

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,050
that template stuff maybe write some

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,730
code and let's get that into like a

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,260
testing environment and let's just see

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,270
if that schema works and maybe even hook

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,350
it up to some live data and then that's

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,810
where we're kind of trying to evolve

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,730
this process like how long do we spend

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,680
in that phase of like you know working

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,420
on a shareable doc versus actually

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,010
writing code or do we just let them

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,690
write code right away and is that wasted

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,070
effort so that's where we're trying to

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,780
find this balance which you might be

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,010
able to help talk about how we scale

00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,500
that for bigger teams

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,700
yeah I mean we've got an intake so it's

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,440
absolutely the case in the beginning

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,240
that we were reaching out to teams we

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,570
were being the band wagon wagon and

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,570
evangelizing hey

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,370
you plan come on board and then the

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:56,310
onslaught comes right so they're like

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:58,290
hey what triggered that so once there's

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,330
two things there's a class of services

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,360
that that are always looking for more

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,430
customers so a great and insights one is

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,350
the main you know if you return hotel

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,780
search results people come to you but if

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,090
you return metadata about a destination

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,420
like I can tell you cool things about

00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:17,730
the the top locations or the inventory

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,140
compression or availability like no one

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,670
even knows about your service and so

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,660
you're just starved you're like and

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,120
you're trying to justify your existence

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,830
so you're looking for customers so when

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,150
we say hey we had this common graph I

00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,280
want to put my stuff is so we had a

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,600
bunch of teams like that

00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,650
what was fascinating so there's there's

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,300
like at least two or three different

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,890
kinds of classes of customers that we

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,440
engage with right and one of them

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,330
internally was this I got some data I

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,550
want to put it in the graph and you're

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,740
like okay but Jim is the best at this

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,840
he's like who's gonna consume this data

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,670
but I have this API I want to put in the

00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,920
graph I go okay that's great where's the

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,360
customer problem so we can well what I

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,850
just have this API I want to put in the

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,890
graph so there's there's a process there

00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,390
and now the third group so we had the

00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,950
customers that were you know the key

00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,960
tenants if you will and then we had

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,970
folks that wanted to sort of set up

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,000
kiosks just do their stuff in there and

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:11,490
then the third customer is you've got a

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,730
hotel data in the graph I can make one

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:18,240
graph QL call and get the same rich

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:20,010
business object level stuff right out of

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,440
the graph without having to on board and

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,000
so we've got marketing teams and email

00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,120
teams and everybody else is like oh my

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,540
god there's finally a place that I can

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,130
get to which has I only need four things

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,750
from the graph I just need these four

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,880
things otherwise I'd have to do this

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,710
very detailed integration that wasn't

00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,860
worth it so now we're getting another

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,360
class of customer who's saying you know

00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,220
oh my god I can't believe the stuff is

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,440
in there now that and then we've got to

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,820
navigate that are they using it properly

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,410
are they and this is what you talked

00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,520
about demand control is gonna be we're

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,170
all gonna be dealing with this over the

00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,180
next few years is like it's great it's

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,459
in the graph and it's in the graph like

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,589
everybody's just asking for it so

00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:00,869
yeah it's it's it's a process but Vikki

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,839
Bastian answer your question about

00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:06,610
timing and scheduling we're working

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,159
through it what we're realizing it also

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,770
is that central teams have all the

00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:13,360
bottleneck problems right there usually

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,220
we're distributed across a couple of the

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,809
major time zones but we we don't yet

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,189
have a full global footprint for the

00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:19,750
core team so that's a problem so we're

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:21,549
trying to stretch that out and then

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,770
we've been looking at the embed model

00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:25,870
for the biggest teams that's another

00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,149
factor you've got to think about is it's

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,529
great to have an expert like Shane meet

00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:31,419
with you and do some Blue Gene meetings

00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:33,549
and stuff for a while but sometimes we

00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:35,049
need some more prolonged engagements so

00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:38,110
we've been thinking a lot more about

00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:40,799
this platform evangelism success

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:44,350
engineers and I mean all these different

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,809
advocate roles that we actually see and

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,919
they don't have to be developers

00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:50,440
necessarily but they they really have to

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,909
be passionate about the graph I think

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,130
that that's gonna be a new job position

00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:56,409
is that people who crack because this

00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,909
this mantra internally of the graph is

00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:02,399
the product is really starting to take

00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:06,700
hold for us so it's a great question

00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:09,100
what else I had a quick one regarding

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,289
Federation and error handling that's one

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,179
thing that among different teams I've

00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:14,860
worked on over the years all do

00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:17,049
differently the way they handle whether

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,640
it's the messages that come back or they

00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:21,220
won't have an error code in the response

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,380
I was just curious how you guys see

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,049
Federation are you guys a grating those

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,149
errors and do a flat list or are we

00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:30,940
marketing them where and from which

00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:32,289
service they originate from there's like

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,450
things like that to be able to gain the

00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:38,490
insights from the developer's

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:41,529
perspective in like sandbox environment

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,679
I'll say at a high level I think what

00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:46,210
you're describing is about right to me

00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:51,730
errors are a really interesting property

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:54,190
of graph Co because we it's an awful lot

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,610
of rope I'll put it that way

00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:01,090
and there are I think one of the things

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:03,070
we hear over and again is what's what's

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,200
the right pattern on top of that like

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,899
something even looking back to the days

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,340
of rails just a basic out-of-the-box

00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:11,149
story for how you're gonna wire up a

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,259
database problem all the way to you

00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:16,639
without having to think too hard about

00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:19,580
it and I think you know Federation is

00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:20,899
exciting because it lets teams

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,849
collaborate on a graph but it really

00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,950
does put pressure on having a consistent

00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:26,479
pattern for that stuff because if the

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,960
services don't agree then you're you're

00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:29,509
nowhere

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,960
so I'll just say for us at Apollo that's

00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:36,979
an active area sometimes we can talk to

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,809
a team like Dan's at Expedia and or or

00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:40,429
you know see a cash implementation and

00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,139
and that's the lightbulb for us and we

00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:45,919
understand based on that where to where

00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:49,190
to take sort of the core infrastructure

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,369
sometimes as with errors we see lots of

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:55,070
different things and you know I think

00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:58,159
we're at the point where we can start to

00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:01,159
lay out some some best practices but the

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:05,539
idea that a graph QL response can bring

00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:07,309
back a list of errors partial results is

00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,499
another interesting pattern that I think

00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,749
you know something we can use for good

00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,009
if we're thoughtful about it one of the

00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:14,450
cool things I think about the Federation

00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:17,599
architecture is the gateway gives you a

00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:19,929
lot of resilience if if part of your

00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,809
graph is unavailable in many cases

00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:25,399
what's left is still really useful and

00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:26,809
you often want to return a partial

00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:28,489
result you know think about

00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,659
personalization data for example your

00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:32,509
I'm going to take your app down for that

00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:34,609
so there's a ton of interesting stuff I

00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:38,779
think we can build on top of of those

00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:40,429
sort of building blocks and and I'm I'm

00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:43,519
eager to find more of a standard

00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:46,039
standard way that people can reuse ya

00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,659
even at Expedia we're we're still trying

00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,869
to figure out this error process we

00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:53,659
don't have a best practice to find so

00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:55,070
far we kind of are for the most part or

00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:57,529
since we have all the individual teams

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,119
like hotels flights and they provide

00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:01,700
their service they are the ones who

00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,440
understand that oh the search service

00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,119
failed versus the pricing service right

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,339
that that's up to them to decide what do

00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,249
we split display back to the user so

00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:12,349
it's not really on top it's not part of

00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:17,049
the you know gateways decision to try to

00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:17,049
avoid a common error for that so

00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:28,230
yeah yeah so to repeat for the

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,909
livestream he's just saying it'd be nice

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,830
to have if we're doing is more federated

00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:34,470
model be nice to have an opinionated

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,090
view for basically the community and we

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,080
agree we totally agree because we don't

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,029
know the best approach

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,860
this is just our approach and we've seen

00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,299
other companies do other approaches and

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,539
they look kinda nice too

00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:46,679
so we're yeah it's a err Emily's

00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,419
definitely something the community as a

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,200
whole should all come together and try

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,200
not discuss

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:05,970
I think just to add to the previous

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:07,950
question around how does all of this fit

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,690
together is particularly around us

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,860
having those conversations early more

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,150
from a product and engineering

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,470
standpoint I think we've already started

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,070
having those conversations we just

00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:19,680
understand what the square 7s mean and

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:21,930
how these error patterns evolve at time

00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,880
so this kind of helps product define

00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,650
that scope for us so that we could

00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,970
actually design the error codes in a

00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,830
much more effective way just want to add

00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,770
that some of the early conversations we

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:34,580
just started having from Expedia this

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:38,760
[Music]

00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:42,060
other questions up here in the front

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:45,150
I'll just repeat it I'm sorry what's

00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:49,920
next for Apollo there's me there's an

00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:54,630
open-ended question well I think about

00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:57,000
it in terms of the stages of adoption

00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,560
and the best practice is the principles

00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,940
and I think those two things add up to a

00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,600
pretty good road map in terms of what

00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:06,320
we're thinking about

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:09,330
so really it's all about how do we help

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,530
companies build a data graph so the the

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,750
starting point for me is you're gonna

00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,400
have some core api's that aren't going

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,800
anywhere there are decades of investment

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,850
in business logic and data in structure

00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:24,720
and you've got a lot of apps and so you

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:26,580
know Dan mentioned well actually just to

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,120
step back I think it's it's mostly all

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,650
about collaboration I think it's what

00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,770
are the tools and the patterns and the

00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:37,200
practices that let multiple developers

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:41,520
and then multiple teams and multiple

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,130
organizations benefit from this new

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,900
approach and it's gonna be a change in

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,140
terms of development process it's a

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,810
change in terms of you know the very

00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,670
essence of an API used to be the the

00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:55,560
service owner to find the surface area

00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,880
of the API and then you got to consume

00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,100
it and graphical is starting to turn

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,870
that equation around much more driven by

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,360
products especially the success cases

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,860
we've seen so it's a different kind of

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,330
conversation and I think it's fair to

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,519
say a lot of what we've heard over

00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,970
again from teams that are going down

00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:13,049
this path is I want more structure to

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,529
the question about errors

00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:18,360
I want more clarity about the right

00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:20,940
architecture and the right practices and

00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,620
I want more tooling to enforce that and

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,809
and take the burden off the development

00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,990
teams and and and put it into the

00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:29,730
infrastructure so you know some examples

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,830
Dan mentioned demand control I've got a

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,269
big graph the graph gets large enough to

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,220
the point where no one person

00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:37,710
understands every use case or every

00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,240
client that's consuming it services get

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,929
published into the graph that may not

00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,880
have been built for the public internet

00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:48,419
or your main application to consume them

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,860
so this idea that we want sophisticated

00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,019
ways of governing what that traffic

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,750
looks like in shaping that I think is an

00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:57,649
example of what comes up another area

00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,779
that's I think really important is I

00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:02,130
mentioned at the start of the day

00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:04,230
especially as you move into a model

00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,149
where you have multiple teams on a graph

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,590
you're gonna bump into all of the

00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:11,210
exciting stuff happening in cloud native

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:15,029
infrastructure there's a really tight

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:18,210
coordination there I think around how do

00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:20,940
we empower developers to make changes

00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:23,760
that propagate to the whole graph that

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,350
are safe but that are agile we don't

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,309
want developers mucking with the Gateway

00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:31,019
but we also want a good way for any team

00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:33,720
to have the ability to roll forward or

00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,460
roll back as necessary you know based on

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,200
like what happens in the real world so I

00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,950
think there's a whole bunch of stuff

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,990
around all that space but you know maybe

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,149
the the pithy but real answer is it's

00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,549
it's what we hear from teams that are

00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:48,960
building you know we're an open source

00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:50,840
company we're transparent about what

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,940
we're doing and and it's all based on

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,230
real-world needs that we've run into in

00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,760
the course of people building this stuff

00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:03,149
out I'll ask you a question on the spot

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,159
yeah so native apps are a big deal for

00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:06,750
expedient right the customers that use

00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,429
them are really loyal we get a really

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,919
high percentage of the transactions from

00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:13,289
those yeah from those and you know where

00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,399
I'm going what so a lot of what we

00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:15,870
talked about today is sort of web

00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,299
centric which is pretty awesome cuz you

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,059
can

00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:20,379
you push out a client and the new schema

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:22,209
at the same time and it's pretty easy to

00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:26,799
do that model you can defecate pretty

00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:29,229
fast you ship a binary what a six months

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,849
year year-and-a-half I mean Facebook is

00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:34,149
still what they say is they haven't

00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:36,820
deprecated their one oh we rewrite so

00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:38,979
you you get this tension between the

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,509
need to learn and iterate on our graph

00:26:38,979 --> 00:26:42,639
and make it better because we we've

00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:43,839
missed modeled something like oh I wish

00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:45,129
we hadn't done that and I'm not talking

00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,659
about something that's extensible I mean

00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:49,299
it's literally miss modelled and we

00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:51,940
wanted to place it yeah so one of the

00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:54,129
challenges we're having with is how to

00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,049
balance the app team wanting to adopt

00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:58,479
really fast maybe when we have a not so

00:26:56,049 --> 00:27:00,099
mature schema versus the web team and

00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:03,429
there's pros and cons and we're and we

00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:05,979
kind of seesaw back and forth so things

00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:08,079
like people have asked that team members

00:27:05,979 --> 00:27:09,999
inexpedient said like oh can we do it is

00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,009
there an experimental can we put out a

00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:14,139
query that we mark is sort of like just

00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:16,690
to be used by some clients is there how

00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:19,269
do we all manage this process of making

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,429
better schemas and we get to agility but

00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:22,539
we don't have chaos so that that's like

00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:24,039
I don't I don't know if you guys are

00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:26,049
been thinking about that problem but

00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:27,249
it's something that we have on our next

00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:29,259
quarters objectives is to provide

00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:31,809
something to our community that lets

00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:39,070
them mark something as kind of a trial

00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:41,409
or experimental and now you know it's

00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,269
really fast and easy I'll say a couple

00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:46,229
things about mobile I think I think you

00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:48,759
know it Dan's exactly right

00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:49,959
one way to hear what you just talked

00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:52,179
about is to think in terms of

00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:54,190
collaboration communication so it's not

00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:55,989
just a schema where we've got types and

00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,609
fields there's a lot more data that's

00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:59,859
got to be there you saw some of the

00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,659
value of having usage information there

00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:03,989
another kind of information that really

00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:10,659
belongs in in this central schema is

00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:12,459
intent policy and ownership I think so

00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:14,169
there's a whole lot of questions that

00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:15,539
come up when a mobile developer wants to

00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:17,499
consume a certain part of the graph that

00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:20,079
frankly the stakes are a little higher

00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:21,909
because you can't you can't ship a new

00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,820
client at the same time that you ship a

00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:28,240
new graph so I think maturity of that

00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,740
stuff is part of the answer the

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,570
the thing just historically it's

00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,030
interesting to me graticule was really

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:36,970
first developed for the needs of mobile

00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:40,480
developers where network bandwidth is at

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,920
its most premium and just the the

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,450
ergonomics being able to write queries

00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:47,350
instead of write all the data fetching

00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:50,020
code is so valuable but because of the

00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,670
momentum behind react when graph QL came

00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,059
out it ended up being something that was

00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:57,580
stapled to react as a web technology

00:28:54,059 --> 00:29:00,010
it's really valuable we found that you

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:03,309
can write your graph QL implementation

00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:04,690
your schema in JavaScript because that

00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:06,160
solves a lot of the chicken and egg

00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,870
problem if you want to have a new layer

00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,400
in your stack who's gonna write it well

00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:12,010
if we can have the the web the owner

00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,929
write it and then eventually let that

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:17,440
become its own thing with its own owner

00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:19,840
in its own maintenance model that

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,820
dramatically accelerates how fast you

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,770
get adoption and I think the other thing

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,870
is if you just look around the web most

00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,750
of the conversation around data graph

00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:31,200
and graph kill is all in the language of

00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:33,850
web developers the the vocabulary is

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,429
what resonates most with a react team or

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,559
an angular team an example of that is a

00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:40,300
big value prop for a call client for a

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,240
lot of developers estate management the

00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,830
idea as I can I can reflect my local

00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,120
state with graph kill just like my

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,550
remote data I don't have to write all

00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,850
these reducers or you know all this

00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:53,620
stuff right mobile developers have at

00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,970
managing local state for a long time and

00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,250
they're very good at it and the tools

00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,520
are really sophisticated and one thing

00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:03,130
we learned the hard way is trying to

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,660
apply the mindset of a web engineer to

00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,870
the needs of a mobile development team

00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,220
did not work at all and part of what

00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:12,160
we're doing in the second half of the

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,690
year is a rev of our made of mobile

00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,170
clients for iOS and Android that reflect

00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,460
that lesson and and that take a an

00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,929
approach to graph QL that lets you

00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,880
leverage the state management and the

00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:24,429
local data and the offline support that

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,380
so many mobile apps need in an easier

00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:28,390
way so I think part of its tech part of

00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:33,970
its tools and process a lot of its

00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:36,070
education and conversation but you roll

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:39,940
all that up we recommend the web team

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:42,029
starts just because that's fastest and

00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,999
you're you've got a little bit more

00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:47,249
experiment but in every main use of the

00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:49,049
graph I can think of the mobile team

00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:51,239
sits right next door and says wait a

00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:53,070
second why can't I query this and the

00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:55,559
answer is you can and and so the

00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:00,769
momentum is driven as much by mobile I

00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:02,700
think as web how are we doing on time

00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:05,269
maybe one more question two more

00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:18,149
questions one more question

00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:21,679
Ian yeah yeah I'll repeat this at the

00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:21,679
end but go ahead yeah

00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:46,519
yeah I mean we repeated a question yeah

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,129
like for our people online

00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:51,620
Ian's asking sounds like the best way to

00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:54,110
do this in terms of schema design is to

00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:58,220
reflect the needs of the application or

00:31:54,110 --> 00:32:00,289
the UX I agree with that by the way how

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,269
true is it at Expedia that all these

00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:03,470
different clients have the same UX how

00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:04,899
do you deal with a situation where a

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,700
client they have a completely different

00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:09,980
user experience or shape what about you

00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,720
know ad-hoc consumers of the graph that

00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,909
are just nothing like that how do you

00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,190
balance that yeah so to give an example

00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:18,590
most what you might be thinking of is

00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,929
like we have our web applications native

00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,700
apps but then we have like Alexa right

00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,200
like that's it's just a pretty simple

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,259
bot all it means it's really just like

00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,149
some text this is kind of for us we're

00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:31,159
just that actually is that's where

00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:33,559
graphical is the benefit where the

00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:36,139
collects a team can write a query to

00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:37,580
just you know query the hotel search and

00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:38,809
really all I need is the name of the

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,970
hotel because that's a whole I say

00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:42,409
alright I don't need to get the images I

00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,120
don't need to get the badges I just need

00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:46,340
to get the name of Tel and that's the

00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,629
benefit of graph QL so we still designer

00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:52,730
schemas for our design system not

00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:54,740
necessarily like each individual app we

00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,110
say like look Hotel search should look

00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,940
pretty much the same across web and

00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,460
native so we can design a schema meant

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,080
for that and then if we need very

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,600
specific features for very specific

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,519
clients one we should talk to those

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,309
teams about why but if they are valid

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,929
then we can actually add those into the

00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:12,860
graph and then the clients we don't need

00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:14,509
them don't query them

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,580
that's kind of where our graph QL fits

00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:20,950
in there I mean it's a great general

00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:24,679
question and in general the answer is

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,940
usually if you focus on the product and

00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:27,980
that's the word I'm stealing from your

00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,419
first intro talk is we've been saying

00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,850
client centric but really what we mean

00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:33,320
is product centric right if you if your

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,029
designers are designing their product

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,039
right they're thinking about the same

00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:39,080
fundamental notions and I think this is

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,080
a loop we haven't yet connected is

00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:45,259
getting the design team who thinks about

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,820
these abstract concepts to be part of

00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:48,340
that schema design process because it's

00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,279
literally the same design

00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,440
design and so what is it that your thing

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,419
is it's a collection of exes right it's

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,580
it's so whether that shows up in a

00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:58,840
carousel or a list that's not so

00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,940
interesting but the fact that there's a

00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,679
list of things that you can filter yeah

00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,820
that that is a fundamental truth and

00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:06,580
whether you're a chat app and you want

00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:08,109
the top three or you're a give you a app

00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,089
and you want the top 20 and you have an

00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:11,800
infinite scroll both of those fit into

00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,270
the same paradigm so what I've been

00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,980
telling people and there's a lot of

00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,419
consternation with a lot of developers

00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,599
we've talked to who said you're buying

00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:21,730
being the API to the to the front end

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,649
like you're you're binding them you're

00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,599
you're there why is it so tied together

00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:27,609
and we've said we're not trying to bind

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,740
them we're trying to relate them because

00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:31,570
if you don't if you take this purest

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:35,129
sense of a pure data send you know

00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:38,139
semantic API what you get is a a lot of

00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:39,669
you get a lot of client code you get a

00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,830
lot of JavaScript you get a lot of

00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:43,599
objectives and now now Swift you get a

00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:46,119
lot of code and that doesn't really help

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,260
anybody so so I think that we're think

00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,609
as a community that we're all gonna have

00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,470
to figure this out like what is that

00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:53,139
balance between where does the pure

00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:56,050
platonic product concept and what is the

00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:58,720
surface level UI stuff we're really

00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:00,490
excited about moving to like what what

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,930
folks are talking about server driven UI

00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,849
like we're really excited by this idea

00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,859
like as we mentioned protests and learn

00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:08,320
but we don't really know we haven't got

00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:09,609
it cracked so we'll share what we learn

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,930
with all of you hopefully you do the

00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:12,970
same because I think it's a great

00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,369
opportunity to see us you know leverage

00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:18,089
the work that we're all doing together

00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:22,380
awesome thank you thank you everyone

00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:22,380
appreciate it round of applause

00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:32,950
I just can't say it enough it's a it's a

00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,570
community we are literally changing the

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,770
way people write software and I mean we

00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:40,900
in the broadest sense and this is a

00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:43,420
really exciting opportunity I don't

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,830
think comes along all that often for us

00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,050
to make something really great for a lot

00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:49,840
of people so I hope that this was

00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:52,660
helpful for everyone who came here we've

00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:56,890
got some time afterwards to talk and

00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:59,650
share more and thank you Dan Thank You

00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:01,980
Shane and and everyone else who has been

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:08,389
building this stuff

00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:08,389
