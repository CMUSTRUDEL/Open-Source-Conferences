One of the most important features of GraphQL is that it creates a concrete interface for interacting with your application. This same interface not only protects the data that enters and exits your app, but also gives you a unified method for testing it at every step of development. This talk discusses how to leverage GraphQL as a shield around your application, and presents a unified approach for testing this data access at every step of the development processâ€”from initial unit testing to deployment tests that ensure your app stays up-and-running.
