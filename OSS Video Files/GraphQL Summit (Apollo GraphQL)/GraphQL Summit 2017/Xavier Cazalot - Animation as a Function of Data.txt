Title: Xavier Cazalot - Animation as a Function of Data
Publication date: 2017-11-08
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2017
Description: 
	Xavier Cazalot, Software Engineer at OK Grow, gave this talk at GraphQL Summit 2017. Learn more: summit.graphql.com

Our design & development process is founded on our application's GraphQL schema. It rules the data involved in the UI we are building and it helps for providing great user experiences. What if animations were baked in the process as part of a whole? This is what this talk is about!

yeah so hey we can get started

00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:13,010
oh so so we are all here today at a

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,500
Dracula summit because I believe we all

00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,199
build excellent products and as we have

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,359
seen this morning we like client driven

00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,390
development product centric product

00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:27,489
centric product traffic here is product

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:29,749
centric sorry and what if so we provide

00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:31,699
provide these data in your applications

00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:34,430
and what if we think about how to

00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:36,829
provide even better experience what if

00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,870
we provide with design or data in motion

00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,640
this is what this talk is about

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,109
it's called animation as a function of

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,440
data and over the course of three

00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:47,600
example I will show you well try to

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,600
spark interest in putting your data in

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,190
motion our first example is an

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,609
e-commerce checkout like when you have

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,800
an online store is really young at a

00:00:54,609 --> 00:01:00,980
delicate a delicate delicate face face

00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,329
and so you know in a case let's say we

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,140
are an online store that sell

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:07,340
blueberries and so we have thought about

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,910
these mutations that we're going to

00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,760
trigger and we know that sometimes it

00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:17,330
can fail so even if if this interaction

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,190
fails we would like it to to be to be

00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,020
playful and if it sucks here we would

00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,030
like it to be playful too so let's look

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,930
at how we would want to implement this a

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:30,100
mutation in your blueberry store well

00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,660
the blue the mutation is loading yeah Oh

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,390
something happens back so yeah well

00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:39,410
let's take it easy and retry Apollo link

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,170
retry for exams and yeah we wait yeah

00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,720
awesome it worked so I don't know if you

00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,590
have read this article by stripe

00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,570
unfortunately I don't remember the name

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,510
that you type stripe animations you will

00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,580
see how does it explain you how

00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,800
providing life in our user interfaces

00:01:52,580 --> 00:02:00,680
help to retain our users and speaking

00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:03,920
about users we will see in a minute why

00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,930
we would like to hope we can show more

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,700
how we care about them so this was

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,819
animation as a function of the operation

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,940
result and next step is animation as a

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:17,430
function of the type system so speaking

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,790
of wheelchair users our users we

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,799
we are meeting with our investors right

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,379
right after that and we want to show it

00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:29,489
to show to show them how our product is

00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:32,340
growing well so we have built we have

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:35,010
we're reusing we are using the data that

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,840
IEP I can provide us and we we are going

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:42,180
to show them or active users based on a

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,980
daily range and so to show that we said

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,920
okay we we know that the operation can

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,889
succeed or fail and we are going to put

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,400
life you know graph so we draw a graph

00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:56,340
along the time to show them how we draw

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,930
our graph or draw or growth and we make

00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,639
as we are going to speak with our use

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,680
mr. with this graph we make we make this

00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,720
graph interactive suitors and hey this

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,629
is the better we are in better we start

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,879
to we start to get some users but oh

00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:10,439
something something bad happens so we

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,420
iterate on the product we launched it

00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:17,220
officially and yeah exponential growth

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:19,950
profit awesome we can this this graph

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,900
has been built to provide motion life it

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,629
was but oh I'm going to make a

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,699
visualization about my users but we

00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,230
could go even more faster let's imagine

00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,569
that we are designing your referral

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,419
system so users inviting other users

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,819
inviting users or users so we see with

00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:41,209
you is your IP here you can you can get

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:44,159
that out of us box and yeah so Graciela

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,109
see my imagination is the only limit and

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,540
speaking about imagination let's take

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:51,329
the star was example for from graph you

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,729
talk and maybe stitch it with some kind

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,579
of weird schemas that could allows us to

00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:58,169
ask SVG past data from the server why

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,629
would you want to make that I don't know

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:02,250
but we can do it and this can be fun so

00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:06,449
let's look at what it could be

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,099
oops let's look at what it could be so

00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:11,099
we could have this kind of queries where

00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,780
we ask for person and we ask for SVG so

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,540
SVG are made of paths which are just

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,549
basically strings or coordinates we also

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,949
ask for the fill and we are going to

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:23,550
iterate over the users over the persons

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,469
by morphing them to a new person this

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,789
would give us something like that

00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:31,710
so what again we show loading state and

00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:35,220
and hope we shall layer

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:40,170
and Leia is morphing to look which is

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:43,230
who is morphing to - mother who is

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,330
morphing to chewy and last but not least

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:50,880
the evils of health or movies as we all

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:53,190
know their 2d - what is what this

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,680
animation showed us is we can animate as

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,660
a function of all the things and so we

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,400
can do yeah again we can do whatever we

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,520
want

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,800
graph QL as Co of our application and to

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,400
call how we provide experiences to our

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,250
users

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,290
Wow it just it just feels good if it's

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,510
awesome and even more like with

00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,940
cogeneration or with the new features

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,160
that Apple client ro gives us or all the

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,920
libraries that we build we have an

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:24,600
ecosystem that is a that is pushing up

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,640
everything and so yeah so I'd like to

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,800
leave you with with this wizard squat in

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,740
French a valiant carry on a possible

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,820
meaning that nothing can stop a brave

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,530
hurt I'm Xavier examined those costs

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,340
easy on Twitter I hope you will have a

00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:45,529
good tonight

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:45,529
