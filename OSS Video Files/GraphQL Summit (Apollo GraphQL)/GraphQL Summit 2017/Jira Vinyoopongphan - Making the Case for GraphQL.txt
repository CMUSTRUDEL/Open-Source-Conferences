Ever struggle persuading someone to hop on a bandwagon for modifying a tech stack? How do you convince someone that there is a new approach to something that has been around and “working” for years? This is a story of doing just that, making a case for GraphQL and convincing your team to make the switch.

who's excited about graph QL and wants

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:14,090
to bring it to their company awesome

00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,770
who here's already done so sweet

00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,570
well this talk is not for you so feel

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,509
free to check your Twitter feed or take

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,789
a nap but for the rest of you this is a

00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:25,859
story about how I convinced my team to

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,199
adopt graph QL distilled into us a

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:32,279
recipe to help guide you in your own

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,560
campaign so to set the stage I was

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,289
working on a node backend for an

00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,770
educational FinTech app with both an ios

00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,840
and android client awesome team awesome

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,239
product but we faced several challenges

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,920
that a graph QL api could have helped

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:53,010
resolve so I set out on a mission to get

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,829
graph QL into our code base and here's

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,679
what I came up with a good old-fashioned

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,600
recipe and just like any recipe you have

00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,320
a natural progression from your raw

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,240
ingredients to a finished product in our

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,939
case we'll be taking the reasons of why

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,759
graph QL is so awesome mixing it in with

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:16,259
your ecosystem and then securing buy-in

00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:18,140
from your team and company so first we

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,210
need to prepare our ingredients I

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,040
started off by identifying all the

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,930
people that I would need to convince to

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,390
hop on board so this included the

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:32,399
back-end team both client teams my

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:34,320
manager and even my p.m. then I sat down

00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,899
and wrote out all the current challenges

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,719
within our workflow and our system that

00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:41,759
graph hero could be a solution for so

00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,700
for example our clients relied heavily

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,130
on swagger cogent and because we are

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,450
human sometimes we forgot to update our

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,759
documentation so the clients would go so

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,130
in doing this I realized that not

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,049
everyone had the same pain points

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,090
so I began tailoring the value

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,750
proposition to address each one of their

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,340
needs so the clients were able to

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,149
actually get a head start on our product

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,599
so rpm had to hear the reason we're

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,730
blocked by the back end pretty often so

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,160
I managed to get my p.m. on board with

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,630
one main reason

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,220
and I'm Abby had just mentioned this but

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:25,550
graph QL would allow for parallel

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,770
development from the get-go with its

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,140
mock mode feature provided by Apollo's

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,090
graphical tools and this would have

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:36,710
allowed for a much smoother integration

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:39,670
and development process and another

00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:42,680
ingredient I discovered was that in

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,400
anticipating pushback I got the chance

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,780
to really defend and validate my reasons

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,700
so in my case the biggest reason for

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:54,440
pushback was timing in priorities and

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,920
that didn't stop me nor should it stop

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,840
you get the conversation started secure

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,070
the buy-in now and then decide later for

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,840
an appropriate time for implementation

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,100
okay now that we have our ingredients

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,700
it's time to begin preheating your

00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:13,010
audience so start with your core your

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,580
innermost circle get your team bought

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:18,800
bought into graph QL first an easy way

00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,050
to do that is just finding natural

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,340
opportunities to drop graph you go into

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:27,320
the conversation you know like when

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,670
someone's complaining about outdated

00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,350
documentation boom graph cue oh right

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,060
that's a low-hanging fruit but also

00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,150
remember that passion is infectious

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,040
in fact I'm super proud of this I've

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,170
been able to convince several of my

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,630
teammates to buy an instant pot or an

00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,150
air fryer because I rave about them

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,830
constantly about how great they are and

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,209
if you don't know what those are come to

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:55,280
me after okay now it's time to bring

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,110
everything together and begin cooking I

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,480
think the biggest gap that most people

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,950
will need to overcome is from the point

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,570
of understanding the benefits of graph

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,910
theory on why it's so awesome to

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:09,800
actually proving its value in a real

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:11,810
context so as a chef we need to take the

00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,910
initiative initiative to bridge that gap

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,180
and demonstrate that it is worth a

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,489
michelin-star and to do that you need to

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,620
find an entry point a highly visible

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:24,919
feature within your system to implement

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,500
implement a proof of concept so for my

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,330
team I decided to pick a few of our

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,370
high-traffic end points

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,500
and then was able to demo to the front

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,169
end that the four api's they typically

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,879
call just to load up the dashboard can

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:40,669
now be done in one round-trip without

00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:44,509
any extra parsing of data this is where

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:46,879
I began to see a lot of head nodding so

00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:49,280
this proof of concept I believe is

00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,840
really key to your recipe it's like

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,509
having your veggies and potatoes but not

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,180
having the steak right it reduces the

00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,800
cognitive load for your team it allows

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,189
your team to actually see the shape of

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,590
graph QL within your system and to add

00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:06,530
to that be sure to let data drive your

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:08,710
argument what metrics does it improve is

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,330
it reduced latency less lines of code

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:15,919
find these and use them to drive home

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:17,509
your case for graph QL and now that

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,800
we've finished preparing our dish it's

00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,919
time to serve it to the general

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,960
population set up a Tech Talk

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,569
to begin spreading the word and start

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,610
engaging your external leaders after I

00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:30,860
give a Tech Talk at Capital One I was

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,990
approached by engineers and PM's outside

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,050
of my team on how graph QL could be a

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,599
solution for them this in a way actually

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,340
served as social proof and helped

00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:44,960
validate graph QL as a legitimate

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:47,060
solution and as the momentum grows make

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,620
it a point to let everyone know that

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,020
you're available to help them tackle

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,400
challenges and to answer any questions

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,400
on how to get graph y all up and running

00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:59,449
which now brings me to the wrap-up the

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,779
key takeaways from my experience that

00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:04,370
make this relevant to you the more you

00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,069
prepare and front-load the work the

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,870
easier the conversation will go so this

00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,789
goes back to your game plan think about

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:15,589
your challenges your value propositions

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:17,330
and use these as your tools and remember

00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:20,120
that showing is always better than

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,870
telling so that proof of concept backed

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,430
by data will be a very powerful duo if

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,009
you can quantify the metrics that you

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,300
and your team care about then the reason

00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:32,740
for why graph QL should be in your

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,740
environment will become crystal clear

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,300
but also keep in mind that emotion and

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,770
passion are a big reason for why you're

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,930
here and why you want to introduce graph

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,159
QL so you still want to ensure that

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,969
you're solving a real problem

00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:48,919
and to that I pass the torch to you to

00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:51,889
take what you find is valuable and add

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:55,129
your own that is the end of my speech

00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:57,409
and I can be found on the interwebs at

00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,419
the coma Hayleigh and also if you want a

00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:01,279
handy dandy checklist of actionable

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,920
items from this talk you can check out
