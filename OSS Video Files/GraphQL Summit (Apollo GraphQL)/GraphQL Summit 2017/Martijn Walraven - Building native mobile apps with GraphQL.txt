Description: 
	Martijn Walraven, Open Source Developer at Apollo, gave this talk at GraphQL Summit 2017. Learn more: summit.graphql.com

Development of GraphQL started in 2012 as part of Facebook’s effort to move from web-based to truly native mobile apps, and GraphQL has powered Facebook’s main iOS and Android apps for the last five years. There is a lot to learn from the native GraphQL clients Facebook has developed for internal use over the years. In this session, I will talk about the Apollo community's efforts to take those lessons, and build fully-featured open source GraphQL clients for Android and iOS. Both Apollo Android and Apollo iOS have [will have in October] recently reached 1.0, and I will discuss some of the latest developments and future plans for both projects.
