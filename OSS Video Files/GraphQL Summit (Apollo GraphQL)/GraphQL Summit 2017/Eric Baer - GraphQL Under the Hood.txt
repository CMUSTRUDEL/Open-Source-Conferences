Title: Eric Baer - GraphQL Under the Hood
Publication date: 2017-11-08
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2017
Description: 
	Eric Baer, Lead Software Engineer at Formidable, gave this talk at GraphQL Summit 2017. Learn more: summit.graphql.com

In this talk, I take a deep dive into GraphQL’s specification and talk a bit about what actually happens when a GraphQL operation runs, from the lexer all the way to the spec’s CompleteField method. As it turns out, there is a lot more room for improvisation than you’d expect.
