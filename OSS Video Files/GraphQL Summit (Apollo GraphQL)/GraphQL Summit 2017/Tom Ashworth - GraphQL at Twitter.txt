This is the story of how we introduced GraphQL at Twitter, from prototype to a production system serving tens of millions of queries every day. We'll look at the challenges of GraphQL in a massive microservices system with a huge existing API surface area and many clients, as well as how to build a GraphQL service for safety from the start. We'll cover some difficulties you run into at a large company and finally share a little about some exciting Twitter technology that could super-power GraphQL in the future.
