	Syrus Akbary, CTO at Try, gave this talk at GraphQL Summit 2017. Learn more: summit.graphql.com

In this talk I will present the next version of Graphene (2.0), the GraphQL framework for Python, which includes a simpler resolver API and full support for subscriptions. I'll also present a new GraphQL engine able to handle 1 million resolutions per second, beating any other GraphQL engine (js, go, ruby) in the ecosystem.
