00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,099
graph QL is one of the most exciting

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,039
things that I've seen in quite a while

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,199
we're a team and a community that really

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,550
believes in making it much easier and

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,560
more straightforward to build

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,240
applications overall my favorite part of

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,439
the graph QL summit has been being in

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,119
the same room with a bunch of other

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,119
people really passionate about graph QL

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,150
graph QL is invaluable because it

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,160
provides so many ways to abstract

00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,770
exactly the data that the client needs

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,870
fresh QL is just amazing it's you know

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,610
save so much time this made us so much

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,750
more efficient and everything that we do

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,950
and then it's kind of been a focus of

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,010
our company because of the how credit

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,350
spend our whole back-end API is built on

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,210
top of graphical controls our domain

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,010
model really controls the way that all

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,410
of our engineers think about github.com

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:04,320
as a website and a platform it's just

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:06,240
magical when people move to using graph

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,520
QL they find themselves in a position

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,369
where they can build higher quality

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,230
products at a faster pace what that

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,730
allows us to view is take a lot more of

00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,610
our developer time and focus it on

00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,500
delivering great experiences to our fans

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,900
and our in our clients we're gonna

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,970
extend our website to have more graph GL

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,070
schema in our public API contributing

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,090
back to the community and just helping

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,090
further got to all for everybody

00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,870
we've seen astounding growth over the

00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:38,020
past year resulting in over 2.5 million

00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:40,210
npm downloads and almost 5000 stars on

00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,940
github for a most popular tool Apollo

00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:45,610
client what struck me most about graph

00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,850
QL was it was this tool that has a

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,710
unique opportunity to useful for both

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,870
designers and developers and I believe

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,440
to bridge the gap between two disparate

00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,440
processes

00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,910
my favorite part of car fuel summon has

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,610
been all the discussions that happened

00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:08,490
between the talks and the hallways all

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,530
the people who have contributed to the

00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,940
tools my team has already been using

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,770
getting the chance to look them in the

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,450
eyes and really just thank them it's

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,610
really cool to get that kind of

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,860
technical dialogue from the people who

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,420
created inspecting the first place so

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,280
I've gotten to meet big figures in the

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,530
community and people from companies that

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,970
I've heard of like day to day names that

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,310
are using graph QL to build really cool

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,810
things so much fun to hear how it's

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,760
being used everywhere you know it's just

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,400
amazing to see the level of excitement

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,770
but not just from startups but from big

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,600
established companies it's just amazing

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,600
being able to be part of that community

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,700
