Rolling out GraphQL across your organization comes with its own set of hurdles, especially for those getting started for the first time. Every developer might have their own code style, differing awareness for the various options and conventions, and their own approaches to verifying that their code will work — all of these differences can slow down your organization’s adoption of GraphQL. 

In this talk, I’ll introduce the tools we’ve embraced at Coursera to make writing clean, consistent, and correct GraphQL a delightful process. From linting and formatting all the way to static analysis, these tools have saved our organization time and frustration and given us the confidence that our code is going to work the way we expect.
