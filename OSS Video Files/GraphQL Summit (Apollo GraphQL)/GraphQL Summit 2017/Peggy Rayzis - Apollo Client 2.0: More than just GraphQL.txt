Wouldn't it be awesome if you could use Apollo to manage all of your data, not just the data coming from your GraphQL server? With the new version of Apollo Client, now you can! In this talk, you'll take a deep dive into the internals of Apollo Client 2.0, including our new modular architecture that allows you to swap out your cache & network stack seamlessly. You'll also learn about how our new architecture enables you to use Apollo Client to manage all of your application's data, including local data & REST data.
