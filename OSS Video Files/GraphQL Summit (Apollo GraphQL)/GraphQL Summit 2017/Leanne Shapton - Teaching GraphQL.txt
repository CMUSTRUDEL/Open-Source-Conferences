Youâ€™ve made the technical decision to start using GraphQL. Now, how do you level up the rest of your team? This talk will introduce a mental model of GraphQL to make learning more efficient for beginners. The concept map will explain relationships between existing knowledge (e.g. REST, CRUD and client-server basics) and group GraphQL concepts. We'll also highlight common errors made by first-time GraphQL users.
