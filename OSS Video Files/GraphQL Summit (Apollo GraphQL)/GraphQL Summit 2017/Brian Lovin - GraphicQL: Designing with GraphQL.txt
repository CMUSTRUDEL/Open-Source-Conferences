Publication date: 2017-11-08
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2017
Description: 
	Bran Lovin, cofounder at Spectrum, gave this talk at GraphQL Summit 2017. Learn more: summit.graphql.com

GraphQL changed the way that developers build products by allowing for expressive abstractions of underlying data models. This expressive abstraction has bled into the way design and development processes co-exist at Spectrum, and has made it easier than ever for us to write and build applications. This talk explores the new possibilities that open up when designers and developers can speak the same language by moving away from rigid underlying data structures to a more expressive means of communication.
