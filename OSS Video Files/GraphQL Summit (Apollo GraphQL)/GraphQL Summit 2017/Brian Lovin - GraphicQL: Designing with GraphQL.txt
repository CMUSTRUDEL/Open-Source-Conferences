Title: Brian Lovin - GraphicQL: Designing with GraphQL
Publication date: 2017-11-08
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2017
Description: 
	Bran Lovin, cofounder at Spectrum, gave this talk at GraphQL Summit 2017. Learn more: summit.graphql.com

GraphQL changed the way that developers build products by allowing for expressive abstractions of underlying data models. This expressive abstraction has bled into the way design and development processes co-exist at Spectrum, and has made it easier than ever for us to write and build applications. This talk explores the new possibilities that open up when designers and developers can speak the same language by moving away from rigid underlying data structures to a more expressive means of communication.

hi everyone I'm Brian Levin I'm a

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,950
product designer I'm a developer I used

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,750
to work at Facebook before that I was at

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,940
buffer today I'm working on a new

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,520
company with a couple of friends it's

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,130
called spectrum and I've been building

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,619
products for a long time and most

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,419
recently making the transition from

00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:26,579
design into development has really

00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:28,679
opened my eyes and become a fascination

00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,970
with the differences in the processes

00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,030
that designers in developers take when

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,739
building products when we started

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,920
spectrum around eight months ago we made

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,920
the decision to use graph QL and what

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,309
struck me most about graph QL was it was

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,859
this tool that has a unique opportunity

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:48,929
to be useful for both designers and

00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,690
developers and I believe to bridge the

00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,379
gap between two disparate processes so

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,269
that's what I'm going to talk about

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,399
today is how you can think about graph

00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:59,339
QL as an opportunity to design and build

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,980
better products together as a team first

00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:04,769
someone explain a concept called the gap

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,530
which in this context I'm talking about

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,240
the difference between two processes and

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,450
the distance between them on one side we

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,759
have product design which would be your

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,380
iconography your visual design color

00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,229
picking layout all that kind of stuff

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,810
and on the other side I'll just bundle

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,549
this into developing the dang thing so

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,110
we have these two processes that sit on

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,259
opposite sides of the spectrum and

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,790
there's a gap in between this void so

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,520
what I'm going to call the gap that's

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,189
the difference where the processes just

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,570
don't quite a line okay so this is the

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,030
meetings that you have every week with

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,229
your designers this is the shared

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,880
documents you have on Google this is the

00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:48,270
notifications updating you on the specs

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,420
or requesting new icons and for me it

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,009
represents a lot of lost opportunity to

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,659
work on the things that we actually want

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,469
to be working on which is building

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,049
products for people in the world now

00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:03,890
this gap exists for reason I believe

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,990
it's partially because of our tools and

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,990
ironically I believe our tools are in a

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,030
unique position to to close the gap so

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,900
I'm going to share some examples of what

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,060
I'm talking about

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,650
so I come from the design world again

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,379
and

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,950
I would be embarrassed to admit how many

00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:23,299
hours I've spent nudging pixels but I've

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,250
done it and that's because the design

00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:27,290
tools that are in wide use today are

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,040
imperative designers are literally

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,810
drawing pixels nudging up and down

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,390
picking colors choosing type sizes all

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,220
this kind of stuff and you're doing all

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,409
of this in an unknown environment so

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,849
sketch in Photoshop they don't know if

00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,829
you're building an iOS app they don't

00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,879
know if you're building a web app they

00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,739
don't know if you're designing for

00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,260
teenagers in the United States or if

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:52,000
you're building for folks in offline

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,680
rural India right that's a problem and

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,379
you add on top of this and imprecision

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,200
so again design tools you're you're

00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,150
nudging you're manually picking sizes

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,700
and alignments and as as a result we're

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,930
prone to making mistakes

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,000
the problem with design tools that they

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,280
don't care if you make mistakes if

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,319
you're misaligned or your colors wrong

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,519
your sketch your Photoshop isn't gonna

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,739
throw up an error and say hey you're

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,150
doing this wrong you need to make or

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:20,299
this doesn't align with your underlying

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:22,579
design system so as a result what we've

00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,139
output from our design tools like sketch

00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,780
and Photoshop is an illusion what we're

00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:29,060
making is this static made-up

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,980
representation of an idea of a thing

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:36,049
that someone will maybe someday use now

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,359
development tools I won't say they're

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,519
perfect because I know they're not but

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,590
in many ways they have opposite

00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,510
properties to the design tools that

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,819
designers are using today they are

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,870
declarative they care about the

00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,099
environment that you're working in

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,470
whether you're building an iOS or an

00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:53,810
Android app they're more precise and

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,970
when you make an error it cares that

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,129
you've made an error and it stops and

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,889
tells you what went wrong where it went

00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:02,810
wrong and how to fix it and at the end

00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,790
of the day what we've coded up is the

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,680
real thing that your end-users going to

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,569
touch and feel and interact with and

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,959
that matters so here's just a quick

00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:14,180
example on the top is a design tool with

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,419
the bane of every designers existence

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,130
which is misaligned pixels compared to

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:21,889
something below like a graph QL error

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,020
where I've typed something dumb the

00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,270
system knows it's wrong and it tells me

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,030
where I went wrong and maybe suggest how

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,640
to fix it so our tools

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,720
these different worlds and and when you

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,190
live in different worlds you start

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,810
thinking in different ways you start

00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,040
communicating in different ways and we

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,470
think about building products in

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,660
different ways now there's good news the

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,790
good news is that this gap is closing I

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,060
think we're in a beautiful time where

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:50,480
tooling is getting better I think tools

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,020
like figma like framer from the design

00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,340
world things like composite or lab

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,820
storybook all these are coming together

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,600
to really narrow that gap and make

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,340
communication and collaboration between

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,720
designers and developers easier than

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,640
ever and that's where graph QL comes in

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,170
because I think this is the next kind of

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,790
tool that we can think about as a

00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,760
stepping stone between these two

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,710
disparate processes that really helps us

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,600
to communicate as designers and

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,600
developers there's a few reasons the

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,870
first is that graph QL is expressive

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,790
right it's not so much about the data

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,920
itself as it is about the relationships

00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,600
between data I can understand the way

00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,710
things interact with one another how

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,900
they nest and and it's an abstraction

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,420
right so graph QL doesn't care about

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,580
your underlying data storage model

00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,620
doesn't necessarily care about the bits

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,690
and bytes it can be this beautiful

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,790
abstraction let's just talk and think

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,980
about the data that our applications

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:52,190
going to use in more natural terms and

00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,510
as a result I believe graph QL is a more

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,450
human experience when it comes to

00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,790
building products we we talk about our

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,190
data in ways that feel natural we can

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,620
read them and write them in much more

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,890
natural and expressive ways here's just

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,630
an example which you all will recognize

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,890
to a non-technical person technical

00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,890
person doesn't matter you can look at

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,960
this and grok the basic idea of what's

00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,060
happening right we're looking for a user

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,700
some information about that user and

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,530
some information about their friends and

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,230
this the simplicity of being able to

00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,370
read and write something like this

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,780
changes the way that we think about

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,440
building products it changes the way we

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,510
talk to one another and so I'm nearing

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,430
at the end of my time and so my message

00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:39,800
to you is to realize that graph QL is

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,840
not existing for its own sake its

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,010
existing in the service of building

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,110
great products to

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,260
and graph kills more than just the

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,240
development tool it can be a design tool

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,930
so I would encourage you all to consider

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,310
introducing your designers to graph QL

00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,680
when I first saw a graphical for the

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:01,630
first time at Facebook it blew my mind

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,790
to be able to so easily and quickly

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,410
understand the way data is constructed

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,770
and relates to one another at Facebook

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,240
and exposing designers to those ideas is

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,010
not only going to make your

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,470
communication better collaboration

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,360
easier hopefully save you all some time

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,520
in meetings but at the end of the day

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,650
that's what we'll are here so we're all

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,440
here to do which is make better products

00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:30,319
together thank you

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,319
