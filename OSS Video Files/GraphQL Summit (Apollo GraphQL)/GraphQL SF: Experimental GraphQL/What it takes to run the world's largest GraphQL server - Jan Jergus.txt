He'll discuss what it takes to run the highest volume GraphQL server in the wild, including some interesting performance optimizations Facebook has done to save CPU and tooling they've developed to prevent people from accidentally introducing breaking changes to our GraphQL schema. He's happy to answer questions about Facebook's server implementation after the talk.
