Description: 
	Apollo's Jonas Helfer presents at GraphQL SF: Experimental GraphQL on 5/13/17.

In the past year, Apollo Client has grown from a minimal library into a fully-featured GraphQL client. In this talk, Jonas will take you on a small tour under the hood of Apollo, tell you about some of the failed experiments that led to the current API, and give you a peek at what's next.
