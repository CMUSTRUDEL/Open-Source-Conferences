00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,929
thank you so much for coming today is

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:25,449
Halloween by low seeing everyone's

00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:28,990
costumes now my name is Kyle I am a web

00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:31,239
developer at tinder and right now I live

00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,790
in Los Angeles but I'm no stranger to

00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,570
the bay as Peggy said I used to live out

00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,140
here I got my CS degree at UC Berkeley

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,080
go bears

00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:44,650
I feel so good to be home

00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,290
thank you so after UC Berkeley I moved

00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:50,860
down to LA and I eventually found my way

00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:53,740
here at tinder and I've only been at

00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,330
tinder for about a year now so I can

00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,570
remember my first day just like it was

00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:01,030
yesterday actually my boss his name's

00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,360
Eric Eric pulled me aside and said Kyle

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,070
come with me and I hollered to him and I

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,679
was like oh my god I'm gonna learn all

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,159
the tutors deepest darkest secrets you

00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:14,469
know like the first day evey jeebies and

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:19,890
he told me Kyle you're gonna be working

00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:22,479
on a wordpress blog named swipe life and

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,609
immediately I think my face went flush I

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,170
was like oh my god

00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:31,270
WordPress I've never used the word press

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,270
my interview was like the week before I

00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,560
was coding and react and not PHP and I

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,280
was like freaking out just a little bit

00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,899
because PHP wasn't my strong point and I

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,780
think he thought this worry on my face

00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:45,159
and he said no no no no no it's okay and

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,209
our writers were gonna be working in

00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,740
WordPress

00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:50,499
however our engineers are gonna be

00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,299
working in react and I'm like okay that

00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:54,130
made me feel a lot better

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,399
the architecture was chosen very

00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,770
explicitly our writers will be working

00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,499
in WordPress and we chose that on

00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,899
purpose because writers love using

00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:07,689
WordPress a lot of the times WordPress

00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:09,159
is made for writers by writers so that

00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:11,769
sometimes they could even create a blog

00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,660
without engineers right chances are a

00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:17,230
lot of the gigs that that ride

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,940
right-in often use wordpress so you want

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,410
to make sure that we can empower our

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,270
writers to to get their job done

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,690
efficiently and effectively so you can

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:28,090
have a great blog also however we want

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,060
our engineers to be able to use react

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,130
because for us at tinder we love using

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,150
react we have a lot of projects already

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,890
in react our build ecosystem is in react

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,610
so we can just basically plug and play

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,990
if we had one more project using react

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,650
but using WordPress and react at the

00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:50,710
same time I was kind of confused at how

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,390
he would do that rightfully so right I

00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,400
mean it would be super cool if there was

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:58,000
some sort of bridge between our react

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,100
app and WordPress and by the way this is

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,800
not a new paradigm this is a paradigm

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,720
actually already exist today and I think

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,380
it's very topical today Halloween

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,300
it's called headless PMS not as scary as

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,610
a headless horseman and definitely not

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,200
as scary as headless branches headless

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,020
CMS's are actually the cool kind of

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,120
headless EMS um all it really means is

00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,400
that we'll have a content management

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,060
system such as WordPress such as as

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,030
ghost and all it's all it's going to do

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,650
its main job is to dispose to store this

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,750
content it'll be a home where writers

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,270
can create this content and they'll be

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,870
doing everything except for displaying

00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,640
the content okay we'll leave that up to

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,300
some sort of front end clients such as

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,010
react

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:48,730
iOS Android for example so this is what

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:51,550
a headless CMS is so I left that meeting

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:55,030
with Eric kind of like gosh that's gonna

00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:57,520
be tough creating a headless CMS of some

00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,840
sort how are we gonna do it and I got

00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,330
all my permissions on that first day I

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,100
pulled in the repo and I kind of peeked

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,130
behind the curtain to see what was going

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:10,209
on and here's what I saw I saw we were

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:11,739
using a tool called Gatsby and I know I

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,480
hate doing this like when I'm in the

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,160
audience but can everyone show me a

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,430
raise of hands who here has heard of

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,739
Gatsby and for those of you on the live

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,960
stream is a good 75 percent of folks

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,940
raise their hand and that's really cool

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,710
because Gatsby is one of these new tools

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,110
on the block that a lot of people have

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,300
heard

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,639
of it hasn't really at the point where

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,919
everyone's heard of it but it's pretty

00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:37,099
new it's picking up pace and what it is

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,990
is a static website generator at the end

00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:41,990
of day you'll get a brand new static

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,939
website super cool but this is kind of

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,430
like an understatement because Gatsby

00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,710
does so much more than this Gatsby will

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,110
kind of be our sidekick and it will

00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,509
actually act for us in swipe life as our

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,550
bridge connecting our react up and our

00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,289
WordPress project and so for the rest of

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,319
this talk I'll be discussing how we use

00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:02,569
Gatsby and white a headless EMS is the

00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,189
pros and the cons and we'll go from

00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:08,900
there okay everyone ready very excited

00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:12,500
in the words of Apollo like let's blast

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:17,270
off so the first thing that we need to

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,250
do to use Gatsby is run the command yarn

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,629
global add Gatsby CLI or you could use

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,550
NPM too if you want whatever floats your

00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:25,340
boat you know but um once you have the

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,250
Gatsby CLI installed we can run this

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,870
command Gatsby new and what Gatsby new

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,120
does is it creates a brand new Gatsby

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,620
project for you and if the word gatsby

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,550
project gives you the eva jeebies no

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,949
worries it's okay

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,139
what Gatsby project really means this is

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:42,710
just a react up with some Gatsby config

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:44,449
to it that's for all its intents and

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,069
purposes I feel like that's a good way

00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:48,759
to kind of introduce folks to Gatsby

00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:51,080
let's open up one of those Gatsby files

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,219
so first we're gonna have to change the

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:58,370
directory and then open up Gatsby config

00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:59,839
so in Gatsby config you'll already see

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,080
that it's pre-populated with a lot of

00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,729
configurations and things called plugins

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,979
plugins are really cool they're they're

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,689
packages that extend your Gatsby app and

00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,089
you'll have a list already there for you

00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:13,789
we're gonna use a very special one it's

00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:16,250
called Gatsby source WordPress ok and

00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:18,919
what Gatsby source WordPress does is it

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,529
tells Gatsby hey Gatsby you're gonna act

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,979
as this bridge between this react up and

00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:26,960
a specific wordpress instance and for us

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,729
here I'd put one in the base URL option

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,629
called my wordpress com

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,379
that's where you'd put your WordPress

00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:35,240
instance URL okay and of course these

00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:38,270
these are packages so they could be

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,370
installed in with NPM or yarn and once

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,330
we do that our configuration is done

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:46,760
and we are able to run gatsby builds now

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,020
gatsby build does a lot and it likes to

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,510
tell you that it does a lot because the

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,860
output on your terminal is humongous

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,970
like if you run it in Starbucks they're

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,060
gonna be thinking you're hacking the

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,320
Wi-Fi so for the rest of them for the

00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,760
next few slides what we're going to do

00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,430
is explain what does gatsby they'll do

00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,750
it does a few big steps and hopefully

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,490
when you run gatsby building you see all

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,430
this output you'll be like ah I know

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,100
what it's doing so the first thing that

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,110
it does is Gatsby's going to crawl your

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,729
WordPress API it's gonna hit every

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:18,229
single endpoint and grab that

00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:20,330
information so not many sorry I didn't

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,520
know this before I started WordPress

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,229
actually has API endpoints

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,790
out-of-the-box so if you go to this path

00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:28,130
slash posts you'll see all of your

00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,200
public posts in JSON format and if you

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,539
go to slash tags or slash categories

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,210
you'll see are your tags or categories

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,410
and a JSON so what Gatsby will do is

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,850
it'll hit every single one of these

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,919
endpoints it'll take all of that

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,910
information and it will store it inside

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,380
of a graph QL service it'll be like I

00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:49,190
want it I got it you know it's like

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:53,930
ariana grande you like my post she

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:55,490
thinks just got it just fetched it so

00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,740
it'll store inside of a graph QL service

00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,900
which by the way is why we're here today

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,389
because gatsby employees graph QL and

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:06,440
some very I like to call it creative

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:08,479
ways to to basically create blogs or

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,400
create static websites and we'll see

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,110
some examples of some graph QL queries

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,050
and how we can employ graph QL queries

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,300
to really make a powerful static website

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,130
so anyway graph QL took all of the

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,130
WordPress data that it could and stuffed

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,500
it into a graph QL service and once it's

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,930
done with that our react app can peer

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,370
inside of that graph QL service take the

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,680
results that it needs take the data that

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,709
it needs and pass it to itself via props

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,330
okay so let's take a look at how that

00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:38,240
works these will be like smart

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,529
components if you will this is what the

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,770
post component that you just saw looked

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:44,330
like so it's very simple you can see

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,630
here we're just displaying a title and

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,610
the content of a wordpress post and it's

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,250
coming from an object that was passed in

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,110
via props called data and for all

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,540
intensive purposes this is our word

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,480
press data this is from this graph QL

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,269
query here that we're going to execute

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,290
this isn't the same file for us what

00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,089
we're doing here is we're grabbing a

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,130
very specific wordpress post given a

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,079
specific ID and we're only grabbing the

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,470
title in the content fields we could

00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:14,089
grab other things too like metadata tags

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,980
authors but for this purpose we're just

00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:19,279
going to grab the title in the content

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:21,230
and what graph QL will do when you run

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,420
the build is it will execute every

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,670
single one of these graph QL queries it

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,140
will take those results and then pass

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,300
those results to the components that

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,810
need them and at the end of the day

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,649
you're gonna have a huge react app

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,930
especially if you're as big as swipe

00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,610
life as time goes on this app is gonna

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,649
get bigger and bigger and what Gatsby

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,899
will do is chop it up into a bunch of

00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:44,089
small HTML and JavaScript files and you

00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:45,740
will have a static website that you can

00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:48,920
I don't know do whatever you want with

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,529
it you put it to add bonds on s3 Google

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,209
Cloud you know you'll have a starless

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:56,029
website you could have a service website

00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:59,380
so at the end of the day anyway so we

00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:03,769
adjusted a lot in the last five slides

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:07,160
I'm gonna take a breath and let's take a

00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:10,459
third eye view out what we just did what

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Gatsby did was covered all of your API

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,540
endpoints went to every single one grab

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,360
the information from your WordPress

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,010
stuffed into a graph QL instance where

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,230
your graph QL where your react

00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,269
components grab that information from

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,850
and pass it to him cells via props and

00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,470
at the end of the day we have a blog

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,500
that we wrote and react without any

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,970
using any PHP so that I think is super

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,350
powerful and that's what got me really

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:38,779
excited about Gatsby at the end of the

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:40,940
day so knowing that this actually made

00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:43,250
my first few days that work a lot easier

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,920
and so we put our heads down for the

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:51,190
next few weeks and we worked yes or

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:56,360
anyone else watch RuPaul here a 1 2 3

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:59,269
and on October 1st 2018 we went live

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,100
with swipe life and so that means we're

00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:03,260
just one year old now which is crazy to

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,690
think about what swipe life is is a

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,610
dating blog we talk about everything and

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,889
anything dating where to go on your

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,529
first

00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:13,199
they what to do if you are on a bad

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:15,389
first date and also like what to do if

00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:16,439
someone's ghosting you which I kind of

00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,910
thought about today I'm like this is a

00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:20,819
perfect word for today on Halloween

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,139
ghosting actually there's a post that

00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:24,179
went out yesterday that was like a whole

00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:28,350
bunch of cool Halloween pickup lines I

00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:31,529
do want to hear one so one of them was

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:35,639
hey are you a ghost because I want you

00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:37,559
to be my boo isn't that cute

00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,899
huge shout-outs why writing throughout

00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:43,109
New York they do an awesome job anyway

00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,579
so I wanted to show you some of the

00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:46,559
content that we have on swipe life we

00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,480
don't just do articles we also do video

00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,759
content for example JLo came in one time

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,829
and helped our users navigate the online

00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:56,160
dating scene this is one of my favorite

00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:58,259
clips they are Jonathan vns and Antonio

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,559
from queer I who came in and they were

00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:03,480
basically critiquing bad dating advice

00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,100
and this will give you a little taste of

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,859
like how edgy and progressive our

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,129
content is it's really fun the Jen's E

00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:14,369
community absolutely loves it take a

00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:16,769
look do some makeup but don't go over

00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:19,230
the top part of your roots blow-dry your

00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:22,319
hair instead of finding then focus free

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,959
if a man ever had the nerve to turn me

00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:27,629
down based off of the volume or lack

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,790
thereof in my hair I wish he would get

00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:32,069
some Spanx or shaped way that makes you

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,110
look more shapely in pictures where some

00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:36,059
he is because even if it's a portrait

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,009
where you're just seeing this much when

00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,720
you wear heels your weight goes on your

00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,759
toes and it kind of along it's your

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,980
whole body even for a close-up look

00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,689
straight into the camera when somebody

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,490
is looking at your picture it gives a

00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:49,250
feeling that

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,810
looking straight into someone's eyes the

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,430
last one was right everything else about

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,100
before that like if you want a miserable

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,779
relationship or times know that was

00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,390
outrageous that was a lot that was I

00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:00,680
mean that was like tinder in 1943 it's

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,270
like make sure your slippers are by the

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,370
front door for him and make sure you

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,380
don't talk too much make sure that you

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,089
don't really question what if you're

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,770
shaped like a rectangle embraced the

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:11,000
rectangle she did hit the nail in the

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,300
head with the photos but I've been told

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,920
that it was all wrong so that's like a

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,740
quick taste of the kind of content that

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,480
we have so yes the dating community

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,850
generates a lot of buzz about this

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,870
content but something really special

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,810
that I want to share with you all is

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:29,270
what the tech community says TechCrunch

00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:32,420
has written some articles on swipe life

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,970
and one of the aspects of tech that I

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,410
love to shine everyone you can laugh

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,029
it's okay but it but the Google Chrome

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,560
on it I love showing people to Google

00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:41,690
Chrome audit or the Lighthouse audit of

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,660
swipe life because it's one of those

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,310
things it's like a report card it tells

00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,720
you where you could do well or you're

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,360
doing well on where you can do better

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,940
and just like a report card it's not

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,680
something that can change overnight

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,620
these numbers take a lot of work to get

00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:03,140
up to the 90s and 100's and wanting that

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,880
live this is what we saw we got 100 on

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,310
best practice and SEO we were a

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,180
progressive web app which is thanks to a

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,740
plug-in called Gatsby plugin offline we

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,040
got a high accessibility score but my

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,540
favorite one is performance because

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,700
traditionally for me getting that

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,390
performance number even above a 75 it's

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:25,579
so hard like yes I can minify my

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,649
JavaScript yes I can minify my styles

00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:30,649
but knowing what cittÃ  for how to lazy

00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:33,800
load that is an art it's not really too

00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:35,270
much of a science anymore and I really

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,560
appreciate people who could get a high

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,970
performance because that means your

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,940
websites more accessible to folks all

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,709
over the world so how did we do it are

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,930
those things - a lot of tools from

00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:46,430
Gatsby and I'm gonna show you all - that

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,190
Gatsby gives us for free out of the box

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,740
and the first one is called Gatsby image

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:54,110
and what Gatsby image does is it takes

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,820
all of your images and for us that swipe

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,190
life that means it's our WordPress

00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,290
images and it optimizes them it

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,899
optimizes them for desktop mobile

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:06,320
tablet all on build time and it doesn't

00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:08,300
stop there on run time it does not fetch

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,130
all of your images when a user hits your

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,139
URL it only fetches the ones that are in

00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,670
the viewport and as the user Scrolls

00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:15,350
that's when Gatz the image will fetch

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,720
them and then it will render them with a

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,870
blur in effect so it doesn't cause a bad

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,300
janky UI and I have a video here to show

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,889
how this works I slowed down the

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,569
internet by the way on this to slow LTE

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:28,759
so you could see this blurring effect on

00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:31,069
fast Wi-Fi you actually don't even

00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,350
really see it too much but as you can

00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:36,079
see as I refresh or scroll these images

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,550
will be loaded in in real time so this

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,490
will make your time to interactive that

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:45,139
much faster especially oh there's

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:47,180
Antonioni and JVM so that's got to be

00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,220
image the second one I think is even

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,920
cooler it's a little bit more innovative

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,380
even it's called Gatsby link and what

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,509
Gatsby link does is it follows your

00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,819
users cursor on runtime obviously it

00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,769
follows your users cursor and as the

00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:04,519
users cursor hits a bounding box around

00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:06,050
the user around internal URL what Gatsby

00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,490
will do is it will prefetch the

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,990
resources that the user will need if

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,519
they were to click on that URL so when

00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,959
they do click on it a lot of the

00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,269
resources are already fetched and

00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,190
already there so I want to give a quick

00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:19,519
example I'll open up the Google Chrome

00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,649
tools the network tab to show you so

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,990
notice as my cursor is hovering over

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:28,100
your l's more and more network calls are

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,690
being made these are the prefetches it's

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,069
really freaky like someone yesterday I

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,180
was explaining this to said it almost

00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:35,029
feels like the web site is broken

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:37,459
because you click it the web site just

00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:39,730
immediately shows up it's almost like

00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:43,160
you have to add a fake loading in there

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,470
but anyway thanks the Gatsby image and

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,630
Gatsby link we got our performance score

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,699
to a 98 and yes there's always work that

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,079
we can do but these are two things that

00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:54,860
you get out-of-the-box with Gatsby that

00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:56,000
save us a lot of time so like I said

00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:01,370
it's much more than a static website

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,800
generator so swipe life has been out for

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,929
about a year now and if you want to

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,480
check it out feel free to go to our

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:10,819
wordpress driven site where our

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,070
engineers and code in PHP button react

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:16,070
and said at swipe live tender

00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,540
come now also I want to give a huge

00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,460
shout out to everyone that worked on

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,380
this we have a content creation team out

00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,000
in New York who does an amazing job they

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,070
write two articles a day even on

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,510
weekends and I want to give a huge shout

00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,060
out to all of the engineers who worked

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,100
on this we have engineers in our offices

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,960
in Palo Alto and Los Angeles who did a

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,730
magnificent job creating this and

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,890
keeping it up so I want to give a thanks

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:41,990
to everyone now before I go I want to

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:46,040
share one personal story if that's okay

00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:50,540
this came out in October of 2018 a few

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,610
months later it was in June 2019 of this

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,200
year there was like an earthquake in

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,380
Ohio it was like really small but I'm

00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,210
like an earthquake in Ohio what oh so

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,230
he's the ones in California and then

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,720
there was like a lot of flooding in New

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,130
York and I was reading this local news

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,920
article on like one of those local news

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,170
websites and while I was reading it the

00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,140
website turned into a like turn into a

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:13,460
succulent and it was really weird like

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,520
as weird as that sounds like the website

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,480
succulent and I'm like okay weird flex

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,250
but okay let's go through a different

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,460
website and I went to a different use of

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:24,580
website and that too was already a

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,830
succulent I went to nine-to-five Mac

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:30,290
succulent techcrunch succulent I only go

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,880
what on earth is going on here you guys

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,380
like I thought it what my computer might

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,840
have been hacked with like a weird virus

00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,070
same thing on my phone and I went to

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,590
Twitter to find out what was going on

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,120
and Kyle Frost said it best he said

00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:46,520
today's a today's a big day for

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,170
succulents hashtag WordPress for anyone

00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,060
who's created a wordpress blog recently

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,770
like a greenfield WordPress blog knows

00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,690
what this is this is the the default

00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,460
theme that you get when you create a

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,810
wordpress site and what actually

00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,420
happened was there was a wordpress

00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:02,330
outage and WordPress revita reverted

00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:07,340
everyone's premium blogs with images of

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:09,200
succulents they're crazy and this mind

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,960
you guys was right before my mid-year

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,320
review June MIDI review was in July and

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,570
I'm freaking out I ran over to swipe

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:21,560
life to find out okay this is gonna be a

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:23,570
is gonna be a great day and it kind of

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,820
was is what I saw there were no

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,510
succulents we survived the succulent

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,450
apocalypse you guys

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:33,460
and what ended up happening like why did

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:37,210
we survive where we like we like the

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,590
chosen ones or what this is like my my

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,230
little diagram to show what happened

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,880
WordPress was actually down for us our

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,460
writers they couldn't write our editors

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,130
they couldn't edit like no new content

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,870
creation could be made okay and that's

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,710
 well that was really sad

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:56,860
however our react up was still up our

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,990
react up is independent of WordPress on

00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,610
run time and now for those of you

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,130
keeping score you're like mikail you

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,080
said it covered like you scraped your

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,820
WordPress like ariana grande what's

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,490
going on here that's during build time

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,710
so every time you build a Gatsby app it

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,590
will make all of those API calls but

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,360
after that it's fully independent your

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,770
react up during runtime is independent

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,050
of your WordPress app it doesn't need

00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:23,050
WordPress so whenever your users go to

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:24,760
your your react up after the build is

00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,350
done when in run time

00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,210
it doesn't make API calls to WordPress

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,100
so they could go to swipe live tinder

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,140
calm and they'll see it everything's

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,910
good and we don't depend on the

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,860
WordPress themes anymore either so

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:38,650
that's why we survive the succulent

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:42,130
apocalypse so as you can imagine I sat

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,550
down that day with like like a big sigh

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,380
of relief

00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,210
and I sent every one of slack messages

00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,200
like hey everyone this is what's

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,990
happening in the WordPress community

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,210
right now and we survived thanks to

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:58,720
satella CMS's and how we used Gatsby so

00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:01,390
that was a happy day and I want to leave

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,220
everyone with this by the way this is my

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,600
last slide but I have a few more minutes

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,580

Alto but if you live here in SF I

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,690
totally understand that that could be a

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,550
hell of a commute you know so we

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,260

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,780
a match and if you want to if you want

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,490
if you also want to check out my my

00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,350
Twitter like a Kyle boss I'm giving some

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,150
more talks in the future feel free to

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,460
say hi and have if you have any

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,810
questions my inbox is always open

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,840
feel free to slide into my Dion's okay

00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:59,080
and I want to leave everyone with one

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,720
more thing if you like what you saw here

00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,900
today don't leave this information here

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,060
at the conference because here at the

00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,070
swipe life team I feel like all of the

00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,380
folks that worked on swipe life or

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,550
empowered our writers were empowered to

00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,080
get their job done efficiently and

00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,120
effectively because we gave them the

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,820
tools that they are comfortable with and

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,320
that are made for them also our engineer

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,090
is felt the same way because we got to

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,710
use react we didn't use something that

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,340
we weren't too entirely familiar with

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,230
such as PHP so if you have a blog coming

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,940
your way at your job don't leave this

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,220
information here at the conference take

00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,930
it with you talk to your team tell them

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,330
about what headless CMS's tell them

00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,580
about Gatsby because the amount of

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,380
resources and money you save especially

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,630
time that's the most important for me is

00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,630
