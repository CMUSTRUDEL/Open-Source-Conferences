hi everybody we are happy and humbled to

00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:09,219
be with you here today at Graf you all

00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:11,799
summit a year ago we were here in the

00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:13,809
audience and we were listening to tech

00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:15,820
talks given by all these talented

00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:18,220
engineers showing what this platform can

00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,800
do and we were wondering how do we help

00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,949
our people start on their own graph QL

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,019
journey so today we wanted to share with

00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:28,000
you how we think graph QL is

00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:29,830
transforming how we build our products

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,210
and how we think about them so we're

00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,250
gonna use some stories from the last

00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,590
year as a small team than a large

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,230
company building a graph that's powering

00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,690
some of our biggest travel brands and

00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,370
we're gonna do that through a series of

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,970
stories in which we're gonna look at how

00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,640
our success has been founded on a

00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,170
start-up mindset right and we'll see how

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,300
that served us well maybe talk about how

00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,250
it might serve you and then we'll talk

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:59,430
about where we went wrong and where we

00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:01,840
got back on course so reasonable to ask

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,440
Expedia group big company been around

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,560
for 20 years 200 booking sites 25 travel

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,090
brands Expedia hotels.com

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,380
Travelocity Orbitz verbo home away I

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,160
think I hit everybody that's here

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,870
there's a lot more so why would we want

00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,820
or even think we need to think like a

00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,670
start-up right we've got big teams and

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,550
platform teams and lots of resources

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,160
well it's because we think that doing

00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,560
something new requires agility and

00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,180
risk-taking and a larger your team right

00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,490
the more stakeholders the more top-down

00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,100
the more pre-planned the more process

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,710
the harder it is to make those kind of

00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,890
agile changes in your in your planning

00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:44,530
so we like the constraints of small

00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,420
startup type teams we find they're more

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,950
successful they keep you honest and they

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,760
push back against the kind of wishful

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,170
thinking and long roadmaps that often we

00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,370
get into trouble with with big

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:59,409
initiatives so here are some startup

00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,880
mindsets kind of some classic ones we're

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,920
gonna go through those and we'll talk

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,840
about how they have helped us along the

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,190
way and Jim I think you're gonna start

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,950
us off yeah start lean stay agile we

00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,730
hear this everywhere but sometimes we

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,160
forget why

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,730
the truth is it's easier to try new

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,620
things with small teams low overhead and

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,629
quick coordination let you spend more

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,480
time building and you can change

00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:31,640
priority in an hour if you need to so

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,349
this enjoy this agility in focus is just

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,550
critical when you're heading into a new

00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:37,040
project and you're heading into the

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,560
unknown we found that the need for

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,049
process is a symptom of the lossy

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,280
communications of a large distributed

00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:50,630
organization and when we start small

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:54,500
we need way less process so who makes up

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:57,170
this lean product team you need the

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,480
people who have the skills to build your

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,250
product but if you don't also find

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,930
people who have felt the pain and the

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,569
problems you're trying to solve you're

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,459
missing out on something key we found

00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,980
eight people from around our

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,140
organization and around the world who

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,780
were intimately familiar with wrestling

00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:20,630
the problems we wanted to solve and they

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:23,480
were passionate about solving yeah well

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,819
next is maybe one of the most important

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,280
speaking in sensor yeah customers it's a

00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,470
small tagline so you can't possibly

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,239
build a great product or a platform if

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,410
you don't know exactly the problems

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,910
you're trying to solve and deeply

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,450
understand them and who we were trying

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:40,819
to solve them for right in our case our

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,040
customer were the internal product teams

00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,680
that really in front-end experiences for

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,109
our travelers so what did they need well

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,540
first of all who are they they are all

00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:52,069
over the globe in different offices that

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,930
we have they're in different team

00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,670
structures they have different

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,920
experience levels different different

00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,889
ways of work and they they work on

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,239
different platforms of course right but

00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:04,130
collectively they have some similar

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,230
needs let's walk through those real

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,459
quick they want to move fast right they

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,780
want to deliver features of course they

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:13,639
want to experiment quickly and widely

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,769
but yet they also want those experiences

00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,470
that they're creating to feel like they

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:22,430
fit together so customers come to our

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,020
site our apps and chat and an email and

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,010
they want to consistent experience they

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,870
want it to feel like it all fits

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,449
together so that's a challenge of organ

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,310
and coordination right and that's before

00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,169
dealing with maybe the change that's

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,300
happening underneath them so our

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,910
front-end applications rely on dozens of

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,139
api's below them right and they're

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,520
always changing versioning they're

00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:41,960
moving to the cloud endpoints are

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,690
changing there's a lot of churn there

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,660
that they have to manage and finally who

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:50,419
can forget the neverending and cyclical

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,270
replac forming costs right on the front

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:55,490
end platform evolution is happening

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,650
faster than ever so we've got teams

00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,660
looking at Swift UI we've been doing a

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,870
migration to progressive web apps and

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,880
that process you know it takes time but

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,880
it's even worse if you've got lots of

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,740
the rich business logic encoded in those

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,570
each of those front ends because the API

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,400
is only providing the data that means

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,770
you are viewing a lottery rights and

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,070
testing that feature and those products

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:24,229
back to sort of neutrality and that's

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:27,530
just a long way to go so that sounds

00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:30,289
like an awful hot coordinate are we

00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:36,680
gonna do it well I mean we know how to

00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:39,770
do it program and all the things bust

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,740
out the Trello slack channels email

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,510
newsletters what about video conferences

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,039
maybe we throw in like an all-hands or

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,169
something and talk about the big new

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,039
effort we're all putting together we

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:54,229
know how to do this right oh my god

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,020
programs manage health of things my

00:05:54,229 --> 00:06:01,789
whole career yeah we got to find a

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:04,010
better way so next now hearing that list

00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,330
if you're like me you're thinking we got

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,590
to get to solutions like we got it we

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,349
got to solve some of these problems but

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,330
before we do let's take a step back

00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:13,550
let's breathe and let's think about

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,830
where it's all going because at your

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,660
organization at your company there's

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,210
other things going on I mean I know it'd

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,949
be fun to think that everything revolves

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,080
around your team but there are other

00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,510
priorities so figure out like how your

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,389
work fits within that larger framework

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,770
because that will help you guide when is

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,580
the right time to head in one direction

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:37,430
or another so that's our vision or I

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,320
should say our vision was really pretty

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,590
simple when you boil it down right there

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,780
were two

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,310
parts we wanted to have that seamless

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,560
experience we talked about and we just

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,890
wanted to happen faster right and with

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,020
less effort why I've been at the company

00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,540
for longer than I'm going to say

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,880
publicly but long enough to have built

00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,520
some of our applications three times and

00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,930
it takes so much time and energy to do

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,330
that that we don't get to work on the

00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,340
problems that the industry has long

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,080
promised travelers like amazing travel

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,130
planning an incredible personalization

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,800
it's just always on the back lawn so we

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,540
really wanted to work faster and better

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,750
so our approach and this is where graph

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,840
QL comes in right far more than a better

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,220
rest we're convinced the graph QL for

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,980
the first time is transformational

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,620
because it finds it defines a place a

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,680
single place a single layer where your

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,480
product can actually be understood

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,570
discovered and leveraged by all your

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:39,380
clients and as importantly your product

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:40,880
team can see it all together can can

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,410
improve it and can think about it

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,480
holistically rather than thinking about

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,610
its expression in every single front-end

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,660
which has been what's happened for years

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:53,360
at Expedia and finally then putting it

00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,440
in that layer and Matt kind of mentioned

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,290
this in the keynote but not layer

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,730
between the front ends and the back ends

00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,980
which are constantly churning and

00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,950
changing and growing and evolving means

00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:07,070
could it possibly survive could it

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,530
endure the next cycle of Bri platforms

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:12,500
and rewrites because that would be

00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,090
something pretty fundamentally new and

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,390
finally we could have that application

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:21,110
grow over time not have to get rewritten

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:23,660
so next mindset we've done our research

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,880
we've got our team we asked ourselves a

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,220
question what can we do that would

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,810
gather the critical mass needed to build

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:35,300
this huge Expedia travel graph and

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,280
whether you're building something that

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,720
you're selling or you're building a

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,880
product for your internal team the

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,210
answer is the same we had to make

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,400
something that people want to use I'm

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,160
looking at the stairs in the audience

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,920
like thanks Jim for your sage advice but

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,339
think back to the last and pearl two

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,339
that you use that was just bad its

00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:01,139
undocumented it's hard to use sometimes

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,209
it doesn't even work we knew we had to

00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:08,190
do better than that and so this was our

00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:10,680
answer to getting that traction we knew

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,639
we needed to create a single graph for a

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,649
front-end clients to consume so that's

00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,740
what we did and prior to Apollo

00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:20,910
Federation we used the schema stitching

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,540
we also knew that we wanted to

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:27,110
streamline creating SDL's and writing

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,089
resolvers so we decided to go code first

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,660
Kotlin was our language of choice so our

00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:35,430
team open-source graph QL Kotlin and

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,529
that did two things we solved our

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,269
problem and we also got to give back to

00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:43,829
the graph QL community which is awesome

00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:47,339
there's some nuance to go in code first

00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:50,550
though for people who are new to graph

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:52,680
QL it's not always obvious when a code

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,910
change might result in a breaking schema

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,320
change at Expedia scale it's

00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,760
outrageously expensive to have a

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,370
breaking schema change happen in

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,470
production so we needed to put a system

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,050
in place that gave our developers

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:10,860
confidence and also provided a safety

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:13,709
net now we needed to monitor all of our

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,720
clients operations and compare those

00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:18,269
against any potential schema changes

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,100
this is an incredibly complicated system

00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,560
to build so instead of trying to do it

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,980
ourselves we invested in the Apollo

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,959
schema validation this is basically

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,750
already paid for itself by preventing

00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:35,160
numerous potential live site outages and

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:39,089
we're super happy with it so it's not

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,260
enough to just build a service you also

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,720
need to monitor it

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,870
our teams are gonna need things like

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,449
request tracing and event logging

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,970
performance monitoring and alerting so

00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:54,319
we took our platform and we plugged it

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:57,750
into our existing ops stack this got our

00:10:54,319 --> 00:11:00,690
customers to production fast but there

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,030
was still a need we needed a way to see

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,310
what people are doing with the

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,350
to combine the health of our services

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:09,590
and the health of our clients into a

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,840
single view that talked to us in a way

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:15,170
that made sense for a graph QL API this

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,660
is another specialty tool so rather than

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,000
double the size of our small team and

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:23,240
take a year building something that may

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,820
or may not do what we need it to do we

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,920
use the palo graph manager this has

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,730
worked out great and it's freed us up to

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,340
focus on other things so these first

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,170
four things in isolation reduce the

00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,710
friction to create a graph QL

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:42,860
micro-service in production but it's not

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:45,680
enough we needed something that our

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,330
teams could pull off the shelf start

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,060
writing their business logic and have a

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,820
working graphical API in an hour or two

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,250
so we took these four things we package

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,070
it into a single service template and

00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:01,310
now we think we have the answer not only

00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:03,920
to easily build a graphical micro

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,170
service at Expedia but the easiest way

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,480
for a team to create a customer

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:13,339
experience so that's all well and good

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,410
and we think we have the answer to get

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:20,350
the traction we need but how are we

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:22,730
gonna pay for it its funding time

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,190
there's a lot of different routes right

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,170
to funding an internal project you can

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,030
do demos and PLC's and those are good

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,980
and we did it you can pitch to senior

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,100
executives sometimes you get pitched and

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,360
there's a top-down mandate to do this

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,310
but the one we wanted to talk to the

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,680
route we wanted to talk to you about is

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,390
we think sort of universally applicable

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,880
in lots of situations and lots of

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:47,000
organizations and it's kind of just a

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,850
mind shift trick and that is just to

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,580
think like the boss think like a founder

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,640
like if you could make the call like

00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,980
would you really and and why would you

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,410
and what would you need to know to know

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,930
that it was a good investment thinking

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:05,120
this way gets rid of this sort of lazy

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,339
thinking of come on I want to do this

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,670
because it's cool or I think I should

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:13,970
but and it makes you focused right it

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,860
makes you get lean and scrappy and act

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,300
like the resources that you're spin

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:23,360
or ones that you're paying for so let's

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,800
talk about what happens next so you get

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,480
some initial seed funding right you're

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,180
off and running and you're building your

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,430
graph now if you take this sort of

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,290
hopefully universal mandate and you just

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,990
run out for a year for your grand vision

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,360
you're setting yourself up for surefire

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,980
change right I mean you're you're

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,350
putting yourself at risk so instead

00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,030
you've and we've heard this today you've

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,580
got a deliver value you've got to find

00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:49,130
something that your business needs that

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,650
you can solve in the short term and

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,360
deliver it and that should be customer

00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:58,040
value that translates to business value

00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,680
and that's not enough because you've got

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,330
to keep that process going because

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,770
change is gonna come around the corner

00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,890
right in any of these projects they're

00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:09,320
gonna take time and whether that change

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,390
is a priority shift new senior

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,580
leadership a merger and acquisition

00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,170
we've been through all of those if you

00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,850
want your project to survive that change

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,070
the best way to do that is to

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,140
consistently deliver value right for

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,090
relatively low investment and then it's

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,110
really an easy decision when when senior

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,730
leaders are trying to decide where to

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,010
invest because they see oh there's a

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,320
team every time that we give them

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,180
resources they deliver value so that's

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,470
just a key thing you want to think about

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:38,390
to survive the change that's gonna come

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:42,080
so we've done a lot of talking about

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:44,230
theory and maybe we do a story or two or

00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,570
three we're gonna tell a few stories

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:51,110
that show how we demonstrated value

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:53,090
early how we learn to be humble how we

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,610
had to change direction and ultimately

00:14:53,090 --> 00:15:00,470
how we continue to get funding for our

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:03,230
vision when we first built our native

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,110
applications we also built a set of

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,960
specialized mobile api's and these

00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:13,010
mobile api's exposed the capabilities of

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,620
our monolith web app we started with a

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,210
shared codebase but the web team was

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,490
going off in another direction and

00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:22,070
migrating to their more modern web stack

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:25,190
and as they were doing that the mobile

00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:28,490
api's became stale they were missing out

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,209
on features our fastest growing platform

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,999
our Nate

00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:34,790
that platform was left to play ketchup

00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:36,980
and they were feeling the pain I know

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:42,319
this because I came from the native app

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:44,809
team and all I felt was pain so it was

00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:47,420
almost like the lodging team had just

00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:50,720
launched their mission to the moon and

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:54,050
we were stuck in a cave building tools

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,529
out of stone from the very beginning

00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:01,040
when Dan and I and the team kicked off

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:05,389
our graph QL journey we had our eyes on

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,149
this prize create a single shared API a

00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:10,910
common place for the native teams and

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:14,629
the web teams to talk about lodging as a

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:16,999
product to unleash the native apps to

00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:19,579
reach their full potential and even more

00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:22,129
importantly take a huge step towards

00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:25,429
building these cohesive experiences for

00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:28,160
our travelers and gaining platform

00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:30,709
leverage along the way the short story

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:40,399
is we did it this is our first success

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:44,389
we set out and we did it so I know and

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,399
we chose a problem our iOS and our iOS

00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:49,399
and Android clients and migrated to our

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,779
new graph based queries and suddenly

00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,480
features that have been sitting in the

00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:55,459
backlog for months were just there in

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,670
the graph this is super exciting for us

00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:01,129
our mobile engineers were so happy they

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,629
were able to implement features in hours

00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:05,360
and days things that would have

00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:09,140
previously taken them weeks like we felt

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,549
we really had this just nailed so let's

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,659
just do a quick recap like why this

00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:16,250
worked for us our stakeholders were they

00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,589
really cared about getting the latest

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:22,339
and greatest features for our native

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:24,980
apps and we had provided a path to get

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,169
there and we partnered with our native

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,260
app team who were hungry as we were

00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:32,240
about solving this problem and we didn't

00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,370
take a year to do this we did this in a

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,620
month or two and so we showed this value

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,409
quickly and this caused other people to

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:42,270
want to get in the graph too but not

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:46,260
everything went perfectly as things

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:48,000
we do our small core team that built

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,180
that initial lodging schema we did that

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,070
on behalf of lodging team we thought we

00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,930
were helping them out because they were

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,120
busy with other things and we were gonna

00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,460
hand him over this shiny new toy and

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,570
they would thank us for it but it turns

00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:05,970
out we were way wrong we had solved the

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,670
traveler problem and the business

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,400
problem but we didn't solve our customer

00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,230
problem our customer our platform

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,330
customer was that lodging team and we

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,550
had kind of taken away the opportunity

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,790
for them to learn how to build this

00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,470
schema and graph QL service and by doing

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,630
that we kind of robbed them of the

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:28,650
ownership that you feel when you get to

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:32,370
build something awesome and new so big

00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:34,410
oops but we learned we switch gears we

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,480
came up with a transition plan that put

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,460
the lodging team back in the driver's

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,070
seat and crisis averted

00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,170
lesson learned like we can't design

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,000
someone else's schema for them they need

00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,370
to take that ownership but it's in the

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,390
past we learned pretty much ready for

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:54,240
anything at this point yeah here's our

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,770
hubris story so we got this right we got

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,230
momentum teams are joining the graph

00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,850
everyone seems to get it we just we've

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,670
really feel like we have the tiger by

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:07,110
the tail which is a terrible handle for

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:10,260
a tiger just FYI it and our Tiger showed

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:12,390
up in the next big product team to join

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,670
the graph they were they were really

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,980
ready to go they had been planning their

00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,020
attack for a couple of months they had a

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,450
big complicated domain problem important

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,800
to the business a bunch of teams lined

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,790
up they were gonna also do the

00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,740
progressive web app at the same time so

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,890
I mean what could go wrong right we got

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,910
it

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:40,650
lots of Menem we got a huge team yeah

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:44,670
new back-end sure new front-end yeah a

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:48,290
year worth of milestones plus yeah how

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:52,740
is this the lean agile startup approach

00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:54,690
all right so all right fair but you know

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,020
we had just come off of a mistake about

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,470
doing too much right so we

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,880
to be those graph QL champions and step

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,180
back and let this team kind of own their

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,520
process well let's talk about real

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,620
quickly how that went they published a

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,110
schema for us to look at and it was a

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,150
nice graph QL schema of a traditional

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,910
REST API they'd built this API many

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,260
times over the years and it did what it

00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,050
was intended to do but what it didn't do

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,910
it didn't thin out the clients so we

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,890
talked to them it's oh you're this is

00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,390
the new vision it's gonna you know we're

00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,310
gonna make these an API much richer and

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,460
have behavior in it like our BFF so that

00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:32,320
the friends can get thin but they said

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,940
that's gonna require us to literally

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,620
like work with teams that are in

00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,090
different time zones right the front-end

00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,120
engineers are one place the back in

00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,740
another place and as we got into this we

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,650
realized we had just fundamentally

00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,020
misunderstood our customer and we hadn't

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,820
given them the time we had kind of a two

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,160
and a half year head start so it was

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,200
very unfair for us to assume that they

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,050
had had that time to get used to this

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,610
new model and we picked the super

00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,620
ambitious goal right because we were so

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,750
confident from all of our wins why not

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,390
just go for broke right we've forgotten

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:07,540
this daily

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:09,310
so repair and recovery are key right

00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,020
you're gonna make mistakes especially if

00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,240
you're a champion right you're you've

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:16,510
got good intent but not always good

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,330
results so don't be don't be afraid of

00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:22,000
being humble admit your mistakes we got

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,320
this team and sat down with them they

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,570
got back on track they picked a new

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,830
problem they put it in production and

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,080
then they got the confidence to now to

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,990
plan the rest of their roadmap so you

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,790
know and also lean into that friction if

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,860
one of the teams within your

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,420
organization is not getting it according

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,070
to that to you it's probably because

00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,390
you're not explaining something right or

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,550
you're not thinking about it right so

00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,800
lean into that friction Jim what do we

00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,950
got next I'm starting to see some

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,000
patterns here this whole story is almost

00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,060
like we're just learning from our

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,060
mistakes

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,040
speaking of mistakes we let our

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:59,170
customers run and instead of trying to

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,870
put our arms around them we'll just let

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,820
them get their products in the graph and

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,730
now that we've done this we finally have

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,390
to find in a single layer an

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,160
understanding of how our products work

00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,440
and what this is doing is that now our

00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,510
customers are seeing patterns they're

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,700
seeing what the team over here did to

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:19,400
solve a particular problem and they're

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:23,030
sharing it and now they're asking us the

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,820
questions what's the same about these

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:28,400
experiences and what if anything is

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,930
meaningfully different do we need the

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,150
lodging and the flights and the

00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:34,940
activities and the car teams to each

00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,860
build and express their own opinion of

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,420
what a sort and filter screen is in our

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:43,930
graph but can we build this once and

00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:46,340
power them all with a single operation

00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:49,250
our next chapter is gonna be server

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:53,510
driven UI building an experiment that

00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:55,970
can run across all of our platforms all

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,070
of our lines of business and doing that

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,350
without touching a single line of code

00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:04,070
in our web app or pushing anything to

00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:06,320
the app stores can we do it I think we

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,270
can but this is a bit of a tease because

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,030
we're gonna cover that story in another

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:14,420
talk basically what I'm trying to say is

00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:19,430
our job is all done here cash in go home

00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:21,680
time to retire IPO time right no not

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,050
hardly we've got so much work left to do

00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,600
but but let's do this let's review those

00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,200
mindsets and kind of check in and see

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,630
how we're doing

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,140
so start Lee and stay agile how we doing

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,180
so just to touch back on patterns not a

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,790
lot has changed here we're still stayin

00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,350
lean we are growing our team to get more

00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,870
global coverage but we're talking about

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:45,920
going from 8 people to 10 people not

00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:49,250
from 8 to 100 so we still think we got

00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,720
the vision and we know our customer and

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,400
we're just trying to round out the edges

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,500
and pay attention to the community to

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,320
make sure that that any needs that come

00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,210
up we address like Dan said our vision

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,040
is the same we're starting to see more

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,380
teams practice it but it's not

00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,060
completely business as usual I'm gonna

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,860
continue to use this platform to

00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,050
demonstrate value and look for

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:13,270
opportunities to get more people to join

00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:15,380
on board we think we identified the the

00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:18,080
solution to the product problem and the

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,510
fit is good we continue to work on

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,070
adopting more on the platform side and

00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,450
operations registry

00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,670
we're looking ahead at Federation and

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,040
we're really excited about that we've

00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:30,080
gotten continued support and funding

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,210
from just getting new products and teams

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,100
on the graph and our next round of

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,800
funding is going to come from helping

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:42,200
teams use server driven UI to do more

00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:44,420
with less effort okay so yeah thanks for

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,740
listening everybody it's been really

00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,870
exciting to be able to share the story

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,270
but we really almost are more interested

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,460
in hearing yours in just the brief time

00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,110
we've been here this morning there are

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,180
so many echoes of what we're

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,830
experiencing so we're really looking to

00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,830
the community to help teach all of us

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,990
how to handle these things swing by our

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,810
booths were over there in the corner we

00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,940
also have teammates from our verbo and

00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,910
humble way to herb sorry verbo home away

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,320
and hotels calm that's right and we'd

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,600
love to hear your stories thanks

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,740
everyone for listening see you next year

00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,740
