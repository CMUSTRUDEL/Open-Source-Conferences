Title: How to talk to your boss about GraphQL (BRANDON PAQUETTE -Tech Lead at Cresta)
Publication date: 2019-11-02
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2019
Description: 
	For most folks, the technical ROI on GraphQL is apparent. But how do you explain that to people at work who think more in spreadsheets than they do in graphs?

nobody told me this was supposed to be

00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,629
insightful so that was promised I'm not

00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:13,280
sure that that's actually gonna pan out

00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:16,340
all right hi everybody this is how to

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,570
talk to your boss about graph QL and

00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,730
we're gonna be talking about thinking

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,119
about strategic technical discussions so

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,349
if you're in the wrong room well talk

00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:26,419
before I get started I wanted to give a

00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:28,039
special shout out to Tommy over at how

00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:28,999
Sarah definitely stopped by and spend

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,829
some time learning about that product

00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:32,210
not only is it one of the best technical

00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,550
decisions that I've ever been a part of

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,289
but I picked his brain extensively for

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,500
this so if you don't agree with any of

00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:40,510
this blame him he's a great guy great

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,280
team

00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,539
all right so in classic presentation

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,670
form first I'm gonna tell you what I'm

00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,050
gonna tell you we're gonna cover the big

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,940
questions like Who am I why am I here

00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,230
what are we doing here then we're gonna

00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,690
talk about planning your strategy for

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,160
these sorts of conversations I move on

00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,859
to understanding your stakeholders and

00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,000
we're gonna wrap it up with some fuzzy

00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:02,839
stuff about thinking about a shared

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,829
language all right so I've had a couple

00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:05,840
questions about what this talk is about

00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:07,520
because I confess the titles a bit on

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,250
the marketing side so I wanted to

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,390
explain in I guess academic form by

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,430
explaining what it's not so the first

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,020
thing it's not is a step-by-step guide

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,520
on how to persuade your colleagues to

00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,050
adopt graphical it's obviously big

00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,220
technology it's a big spec there's a lot

00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,870
of stuff changing and even three years

00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,040
I've been following it everything's sort

00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,440
of different so it's it's sort of

00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,960
impossible for me to give bespoke

00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,420
information to help you win those

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,200
discussions from a technical perspective

00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,390
and the second thing it's not as a

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,860
general guide on how to say technical

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,300
things to non-technical people that's a

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,480
super important skill set it's not one

00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,340
particular shouldn't talk about today so

00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,320
what is it so strategic technical

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,150
discussions I want to define that by

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,160
looking first at normal technical

00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,420
discussions so these normal technical

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,920
discussions you're sort of having on a

00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,360
day to day basis the people around you

00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,910
be they the product the designers

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,860
whomever you need to to sort of explain

00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,770
things learn things and arrive at the

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,420
optimal technical decision I Neely these

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,640
are predicated on things like facts

00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,660
objective reasoning analysis so on and

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,340
so forth they're sort of like you can

00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,450
sort of feel the correct answer coming

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,430
out of these things and they're they're

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,759
pretty easy to wrap your mind around if

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,079
you're of the engineering persuasion

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,690
this size is commensurate with that

00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:15,490
right so these are decisions that are

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,690
to your team often or to your portion of

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,250
the company and if you happen to pick

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,720
the wrong database for example for a

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,910
project your company's probably not

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,320
going to go under so they're reversible

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,090
and compartmentalized which makes them a

00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,170
little low-pressure that said though if

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,430
you get good at them you can get a

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,870
reputation as someone who can clearly

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,160
communicate and make smart technical

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,990
decisions many things so that's why it's

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,800
important to many engineers so I want to

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,070
be good at these things and to

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,750
prioritize being better communicators so

00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,150
let's look at strategic technical

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,640
discussion so ideally these are also

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,430
based on data and facts but there's a

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,160
much fuzzier people element cities there

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,020
are a lot more stakeholders involved

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,910
that will want to have a say and this is

00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,010
primarily because these decisions tend

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,390
to be much larger in scale they could

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,700
affect the entire company if you make a

00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,500
decision of this magnitude wrong you

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,720
might have some explaining to do to the

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,950
shareholders in a few years when things

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,330
are going poorly so they could be as big

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,120
as you want them to now graphic you all

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,350
obviously isn't necessarily of this size

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,960
but it certainly can be it has the

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,310
potential to be a dramatically large and

00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,540
so you should expect that a lot of

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,090
people are going to have a say in that

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,770
sort of discussion and then commensurate

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,270
with the size of these discussions these

00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,770
are the sorts of things where if you do

00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,500
well they're career-defining

00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,230
right so if you're good at these massive

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,580
technical architecture changes this can

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,080
be the sort of thing that sets you up so

00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,130
this is one of the these are the reasons

00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,350
that I think we should care about these

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,490
things so as I said the ability to talk

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,010
about technical things is definitely

00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,209
requisite in both of these the tools

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,830
were going to talk about today are meant

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,570
to pick up where those leave off in this

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,220
latter bucket of conversations because I

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,680
think they leave engineers falling a bit

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,640
short of where they ought to be in terms

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,390
of persuading decision makers so about

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,520
me I actually got my start in the

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,320
military I was a worked in strategic

00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,570
defence acquisitions technical changes

00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,770
there take a little bit of time an

00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,270
example I like to give is that I

00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,950
graduated from the Air Force Academy and

00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,170
some of my friends are flying the same

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,940
b-52s their grandfather's flew in World

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,459
War two I don't mean the same model I

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,830
mean the same aircraft so that's that's

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,510
I mean maybe some of you with COBOL and

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,890
your code bases are not so surprised by

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,530
that sort of thing but I always found

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,970
that pretty interesting anyway so I

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,410
punched out of there with the business

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,030
school I hung out with the management

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,970
types for a little while sorry about

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,229
that and I got to see how decisions in

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,720
general were made but also technical

00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:29,510
decisions

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,360
there eventually I ended up in tech I

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:34,460
learned to build products and learn to

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,020
speak engineer but I didn't forget how

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,640
to speak those other things so the long

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,890
and short of this is that I've had the

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,720
opportunity to be a participant in or at

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,820
the very least a fly-on-the-wall for

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,620
technical change at a variety of scales

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,250
and it and given that and my

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,570
intellectual interest in sort of

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,060
communication and how groups make

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,840
decisions it's been a pretty I've had

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,060
the opportunity to make a lot of

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,080
observations and think about this stuff

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,550
a lot and so that's what I hope to

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,510
communicate to you here so the title was

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,770
again something I've had a few questions

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,960
about and I just want to share where I

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,460
got the inspiration this is a pamphlet a

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,720
friend of mine gave me she thought my

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,980
cat was getting involved and maybe

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,960
running with the wrong crowd so she

00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,210
wanted me to have her prepared there so

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,230
nice gift for the cat person on your

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,480
Christmas list available on Amazon

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,590
alright so before I get into the

00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,240
nitty-gritty I want to emphasize

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,130
something the the tools and tactics that

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,570
I'm going to talk about here are in my

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,620
opinion very useful but they're

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,610
certainly not going to be a panacea

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,070
they're not going to be the solution to

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,810
all your problems if I could solve all

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,310
your problems I'd probably be charging a

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,370
lot more than free for this speech but

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,600
the the bottom line here is that we need

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,950
to take a step back and they start some

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,229
discussions and think about them as a

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,640
project it's not just trying to win a

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:45,710
discussion about a certain technical

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,110
adoption it's not a matter of being

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,580
right being right doesn't really mean

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,570
anything when you're talking about these

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,020
large-scale organizational and strategic

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,180
important thing is that you're thinking

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,930
about it so even if you can't sit and

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,460
map a plan from a to gql as they say a

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,990
friend of mine quotes us all the time

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,100
plans are useless planning is invaluable

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,300
so that's the important thing I want you

00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,520
to take away here irrespective of

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,780
whether or not my tools work I want to

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,790
start thinking about these sorts of

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,470
large-scale multi-party discussions as a

00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,710
project in and of themselves that are

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,790
warrant your thought and strategizing

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,190
speaking of strategizing that's gonna be

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,780
the first tool in our toolbox now if

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,610
you're anything like me and you think

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,960
about strategizing in the context of

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,550
interpersonal and

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,169
professional communications it makes you

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,340
feel a little oily right people who are

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:30,620
strategizing these sorts of

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,820
communications I often wonder if they're

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,750
telling me what I want to hear or if

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,680
they're telling me what they genuinely

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,330
think nobody likes that

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,620
but what I'd submit to you is that

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,970
strategy does not necessarily pull it

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,139
right we don't like office politics but

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,270
dramatic pause for water break we are

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,490
totally okay with strategizing if and

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,350
only if it hasn't potential to get us

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,260
where we want to go in these discussions

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,639
so strategy is not the opposite of being

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,270
a straight shooter you can plan these

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,350
things and not be weird about it at the

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,300
end of the day there's a million ways to

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,280
tell a story this complex and all I'm

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,990
submitting to you if you are skeptical

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,790
like I am about this sort of thing is

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,699
that you picked the right one the

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,889
optimal one for your situation all right

00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,210
so the first actual thing here is

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,800
understanding the very stakeholders

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,770
influence stakeholders a word I hear

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,900
constantly in in my previous life in

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,729
business and in product management as

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,710
well it's not something I think that

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:23,880
individual contributors or people who

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,729
are primarily focused on engineering

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,610
really think about a lot which is good

00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:31,169
because it's a pain in the ass but it's

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,160
one of the first things I want you to

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,750
think about when you're starting the

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,630
planning discussion so the first step

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,410
here is defining stakeholder stakeholder

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:42,120
is anybody with a pokeymon in the fight

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,560
interesting fact I originally had dog in

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,150
the flight which is a popular idiom on

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,800
this slide but I like animals a lot and

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,060
so I want to remove that there's only

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,919
once I put pokemons there that I

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,810
realized that Pokemon is really just

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,979
animated dogfighting these kids are

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,660
treating these animals they're fighting

00:07:52,979 --> 00:08:00,030
out like that's some dark stuff but

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,260
that's not why we're here so Nadia

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,370
understand who the stakeholder is you

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,200
got to think who are my stakeholders

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,460
right there are some easy answers here

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,870
you got your back-end Engineers your

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,250
front-end engineers the data science

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,990
team the engineering managers so on and

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,280
so forth what I'd like you to do in

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,810
these four decisions like these

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,880
especially like graph QL where we're

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,500
talking shift adding as they mentioned

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,300
in the keynote this morning adding this

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,389
new abstraction to your stack that has a

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,580
potential to touch countless functions

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,410
across the organization right I want you

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,090
to think about that broadly and

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,919
understand who these people are and how

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,930
they might be invested in this decision

00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:33,330
so someone that you might not have

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,469
thought was interested in all in this

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,820
sort of thing if you can figure out how

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,200
it might impact them in a positive way

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,060
you may find yourself a new ally in this

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,620
discussion right the data science team

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,089
for example could a graph architecture

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,370
benefit them were they a part of your

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:46,350
original thinking about who should be a

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,470
part of this discussion if not maybe it

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,880
makes sense to bring them in and the

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,390
word influence in this title is a bit

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,530
fuzzy

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,060
but I just wanted to hit it it's it's

00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,680
I'm not gonna go as far to define it but

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,690
I think we know influence when you see

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,570
it so recognizing who the people you

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,980
need to win over are the ways in which

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,750
they're influenced interplays with one

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,030
another and just thinking about that as

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,130
a graph of decision makers for your

00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,600
graph QL endeavor I think it's the first

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,870
step for strategizing these

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,950
conversations all right so the next up

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,870
is gonna be recognizing the broader

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,690
context we know who our stakeholders are

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,220
but what world did they operate in so

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,540
for example if your front end is not

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,240
particularly important to your bottom

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,620
line at your company some of us at my

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,870
company in is but at many companies it's

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,490
not or if they already move pretty fast

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,260
and they're not actually a bottleneck to

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,700
delivering value to the customer maybe

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,100
it doesn't make sense to emphasize so

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,200
much the value that graph QL delivers

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,730
the conventional wisdom on the trade off

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,400
for graphical adoption is that the back

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,840
end team puts out a lot of effort in an

00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,490
effort to make the front end team just

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,740
get whatever they want basically in

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,630
perpetuity that calculus a little more

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,310
complicated than that but if your

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,630
situation doesn't lend itself to that

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,090
calculus thing you should find different

00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,130
calculus it's not only important by the

00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,450
way to think about where people people's

00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,950
heads are at right now where the

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,240
business is right now but also in the

00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,190
horizon when you're talking about these

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,360
like strategic level decision makers a

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,350
lot of what they spend their time

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,940
thinking about is not where the

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,460
businesses today but where it might be

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,080
in five years and since technological

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,920
adoption like this is gonna be a long

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,390
process most likely and the effects of

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,800
it are going to be essentially permanent

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,020
I think it warrants you to search

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,340
anywhere you can for advantages and a

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,150
deeper understanding of how to sell this

00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:28,500
all right

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:30,150
so well that's a funny the animations

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,100
went backwards on that one all right

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,480
once you understand who these people are

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,430
and what world they live in I want you

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,470
to think about the actual things they're

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,320
going to push back on right this is a

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,780
debate in college because I was a pretty

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,270
cool guy and still AM and and one of the

00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,110
things we did was thinking about

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,280
expected arguments right if you can

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,810
think about the argument before they

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,960
make it you got a leg up that's a pretty

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,770
sweet place to be so they get a start

00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,870
once you understand who these people are

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,180
start thinking and if you can't really

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,010
think about what they might want to

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,570
argue about then you can inventory your

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,960
own weaknesses the weaknesses of your

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,170
honor

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,400
minute for example graph kills one of

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,080
the things that has not quite settled

00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,270
yet as the caching discussion right it's

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,500
not clear how to solve caching whereas

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,030
in the rest microservices world

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,150
Cashion's a bit more of a solve problem

00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,740
so if that's that might be one of your

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,510
weaknesses and so you may want to have

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,060
Hans's ready for that in the event that

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,560
that comes up in the discussion but more

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,950
importantly know your stakeholders right

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,840
if you know that caching is sort of a

00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,850
sticking point for someone with a

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,960
particularly high amount of influence

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,300
that you're worried about winning over

00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,880
have a really good answer ready for that

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,860
argument so it's it's sort of again

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,090
building the graph of the landscape

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,800
where you're going to make this argument

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,590
and understanding it deeply and

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,150
intimately now once you so once you have

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,890
those good responses ready I want you to

00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,630
remember that it's not about necessarily

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,650
arguing when you're selling things at

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,540
this level when you're worried about the

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,210
people involved in these things it's not

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,550
about winning the argument

00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:58,400
it's about being flexible so for example

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,290
if the back-end team really loves their

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,630
their REST API and they don't want to

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:07,530
leave those well why don't you use graph

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:09,990
QL as a way of as a BFF sort of the via

00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,060
take the data from the REST API server

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,190
to the front end everybody wins nobody

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,510
has to sacrifice here graph QL adoption

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,890
has a lot of different shapes and sizes

00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,930
it can be as small as you want it to be

00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,190
or as large as you want it to be it's

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,630
whether it's up to you whether or not

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,790
you want to start small I think you

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,970
probably should but you need to be aware

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:29,340
that the shape of that adoption is just

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:33,150
one tool in your toolbox for winning

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:35,160
this advocacy of yours excuse me

00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,020
everybody wins that's the sweet spot of

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,700
a good deal nobody feels either nobody

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,050
feels like they lost or everybody feels

00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,910
like they lost if you walk out of a

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,930
negotiation with AI without either of

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,040
those outcomes then you've lost so now

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,840
we're gonna move on to the second tool

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,150
on our toolbox empathy bit of a buzzword

00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,500
lately I recognise that but I think it's

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,310
a pretty important concept and I want to

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,210
dig into it with an example so since I

00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,340
got out of the military I've helped a

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,810
couple friends find jobs and one of the

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,160
things that is a continuous sticking

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,020
point for military folks is their

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,760
resumes the conventional wisdom holds

00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,610
that military resumes are just too

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,630
replete with jargon acronyms etc that a

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,340
hiring manager really couldn't

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,870
understand what's being sold here and

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,190
they're not interested and I hear all

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,180
the time for my friends my friends who

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,580
have fought in wars gonna be

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,290
things that they just don't have what

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,400
they are looking for and and the

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,890
emphasis is always seemed interesting on

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,390
this day it almost felt as if they felt

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,680
that my friends were perceiving these

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,950
hiring managers on the other side of the

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,030
resume as this big faceless mass of

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,290
arbitrarily applied rules that we're

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,730
just gonna reject them outright because

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,410
they use an acronym instead of a fully

00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,150
spelled out thing and I just thought

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,410
that was interesting and so when I try

00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,810
to get them to do with something that I

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,730
think you and I do pretty much every day

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,160
which is put ourselves in the shoes of

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,290
the person for whom we are designing an

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,880
interface right and so I'd ask them like

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,170
if you were the you know the standard if

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,490
you were hiring for this position what

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,780
would you want to read on a resume and

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,090
that's fine that that gets the ball

00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,530
rolling but you can't stop there

00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,060
is what I would tell them you have to

00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,590
you have to take it deeper you have to

00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,040
get weird with it to be frank you have

00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:04,380
to try to see the world as the person as

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,880
a hiring manager in this case might see

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,620
it what's their job like how do they

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,030
measure their own success and crucially

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,510
how would the position that my friends

00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,830
are applying for affect that success

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,600
excuse me and I think this seemed to

00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,130
help them because it put a human face on

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,320
this person who before was just this

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,120
concept right this person only existed

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,180
on the other side of the resume insofar

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,380
as my friends would perceive them

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,960
there's the person that was gonna give

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,580
the up or down vote and so once they saw

00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,720
them as sort of a human then I was

00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,430
really just writing a note to someone

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,110
right I was jotting stuff down it was me

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,700
became much easier to grapple with this

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,440
and reasoned out what they ought to say

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,730
the arguments a ought to make the things

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,070
they ought to emphasize so and so forth

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,200
and so my point in all this is that when

00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,460
we're trying to figure out how to make

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,560
our case to these people to these

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,630
stakeholders it's crucial that we don't

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,850
just stop at understanding someone's out

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:53,130
someone else's position I want us to

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,110
really try and see the world as these

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,790
folks see it so so a more relevant

00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,740
example perhaps say your backends

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,780
heckley she's pushing back on graph QL

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,950
she's got some concerns about security

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,480
she thinks that the current

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,910
authentication system is battle-tested

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,500
it's hardened no reason to change it and

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,320
rule number one of engineering is what

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,940
if it's not broke don't fix it perfectly

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,110
reasonable argument and you can make

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,690
counter arguments and you can mitigate

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,910
her concerns but what I'd submit to you

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,650
is that if you try to reach across that

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,090
disagreement and just understand a

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,890
little bit more position maybe I should

00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,240
back story here maybe she lost a client

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,590
at a previous business because of some

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,870
sort of security risk and she's

00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,470
particularly sensitive to it now that it

00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,940
objection

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,440
that context seems a bit more relatable

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,420
it seems more understanding and your

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,760
impulse is different than just argue

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,520
back and how did you not stop thought

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,840
and thought deeply about this you mean

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,430
how do you not stop and thought deeply

00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,110
about just you may have just plowed

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,330
through and burned a relationship in the

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,410
process right and so it's like I said

00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,020
it's a bit fuzzy but I think it's

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,370
crucial here to see across these

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,450
arguments remember these are people with

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,650
their own battles with their own

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,570
difficulties with their own priorities

00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,070
and if you don't understand those on a

00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,270
human level then I think you're doing

00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,770
yourself a disservice and you're gonna

00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,230
have a much harder time bringing folks

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:04,050
onto your team excuse me

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,430
I think the practical tactic here is to

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,110
just question each and every one of your

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,020
assumptions right you had an assumption

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:12,900
that she was just a curmudgeon for

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,820
restful best practices and didn't want

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,290
to move on that you dug a little bit

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,360
more you got another person behind the

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,160
argument and you were less he thinks

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,690
from her side and at that point made me

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,160
decide this is not a battle worth having

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,310
maybe there's some permutation of my

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,050
graph QL rollout plan that lets her win

00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,570
right give her that win bring her onto

00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,860
your side so being flexible comes in

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,600
here but I really think it's just seeing

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,790
across these arguments and and seeing

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,690
the other person and putting yourself in

00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,890
their shoes in a big way but remember

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,750
just cuz you're selling doesn't mean

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,860
they're buying you can't win every

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,330
battle some are not worth having and so

00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,830
you have to be aware of that too it's a

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,390
broader strategy it's not just about

00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,530
persuading this person or that person or

00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,000
winning that are gonna know that that

00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,500
argument you have to identify the

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,410
outcome when you start if it's graph QL

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,880
adoption whole-hog that's what it is and

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,010
that's the only goal it doesn't really

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,330
matter how you get there obviously it

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,490
does matter how you get there it doesn't

00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,020
it doesn't matter what the sacrifices

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,280
are compromises you have to make in

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,300
getting there so the other thing is that

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,230
and I was having a conversation earlier

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,350
about this and I thought this is

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,820
interesting you could present the

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,920
solutions that graph Gail is gonna bring

00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,900
to your team to the front end team to

00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,970
this team or that team and you can rebut

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,070
the objections that someone might have

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,600
but what if you flip that a little bit

00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,700
and tried to figure out how graph QL

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,890
could solve the problems of the people

00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,290
you're trying to persuade right then the

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,490
discussion is not about oh well security

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,110
is gonna be fine caching is not a

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,750
problem so on and so forth it's here's

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,820
what I can do for you right and you know

00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,170
don't get too salesy about it

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,450
leave that to the sales folks that's

00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,890
that's not our job but I think some of

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,810
the tools that sales folks use can be

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,910
gracefully applied here to just sort of

00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,290
recon sexualize and back to questioning

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,380
each one of your assumptions you set out

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,310
to sell this particular technology and

00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,140
before you know it you're solving

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:01,200
everybody's problems with this with the

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,490
appropriate strategies ation so and at

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,860
the end of the day if you just you

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,140
decide you can't win this person over

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,370
and you need their support sometimes

00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,200
it's just easier to ask for forgiveness

00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,350
than permission maybe it's appropriate

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,430
to just start a smaller project that

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:16,560
executes what you need to do without

00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,570
involving multiple stakeholders prove

00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,490
that that works and then the question is

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,750
about bringing that winning project

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,430
forward as opposed to getting

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,850
stakeholders to greeson's to some

00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,830
theoretical payoff so results speak a

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,080
heck of a lot louder than words which is

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,510
maybe ironic for someone giving a 25

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,220
minute presentation on words but if you

00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,900
can get those results then just skip all

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,960
this stuff and do it that's my opinion

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,940
all right so you've you've sort of

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,410
figured out who your stakeholders are

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,360
you figure out what they care about you

00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,190
you know you've you understand they like

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,570
puppies and and you've done all this

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,630
soft fuzzy stuff really trying to get

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,770
inside their heads they have the

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,500
conversation though and that's we're

00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:58,470
gonna talk about a common language

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,880
excuse me so this one is I'm still

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,480
working on this one this is let me know

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,660
what you think about this idea

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,520
afterwards we use the the forms but I

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,750
think that the the the moment in the

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,460
keynote that really spoke to me this

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,530
morning was this notion that we are

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,730
adding a piece to the stack right and

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,990
for anybody that works in a company with

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,560
more than one team which is presumably

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,240
all of you you know that and the absence

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,130
of common language in between teams is a

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,810
major problem right it slows things down

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,340
it makes it harder to get on the same

00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,710
page makes it hard to move forward as a

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,790
single unified force for good in the

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,640
world which is of course what we all

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,740
consider our companies to be and so the

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,570
notion that you can put this abstraction

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,610
in the middle of your stack that is not

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,560
just like a data layer right it's a

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,540
knowledge graph this knowledge graph has

00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,280
all the entities your business gives a

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,510
damn about and that's really something

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,010
that's like living breathing

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,170
documentation that evolves and changes

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,000
as your company does so setting aside

00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,050
all the technical advantages of

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,880
graphical I think there's really

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,650
something here crucially though

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,090
abstractions I mean we know that's right

00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,140
abstractions serve as a common language

00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,100
they're how we

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,450
to people about things that both parties

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,500
don't necessarily have a deep intimate

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,460
understanding for excuse me and the nice

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,930
thing is that they don't always have to

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,430
dilute substance you can use

00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,930
abstractions here that tell this story

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,580
better than a detailed nuanced

00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,410
explanation ever could that's sort of

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,760
the sweet spot right so I want you to be

00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,680
thinking about those abstractions and

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,420
seeking out how they can help solve

00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,030
these conversational problems better

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,280
than a verbose detailed explanation

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,660
might I think a great example of an

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,190
abstraction here that helps you

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,380
communicate with maybe non-technical

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,640
people as technical debt right it's a

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,800
great example not only because it

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,360
communicates the concept without

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,280
sacrificing a lot of substance but also

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,480
because it focuses on the impact of the

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,800
technical change and not the

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,600
implementation that's a distinction that

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,730
I think is important I think our natural

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,710
inclination is to is to explain the

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,600
implementation of technology as it was

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,950
really emphasizing what impact that

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,630
technology can have so well I think

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,400
abstractions are important I also want

00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,020
to emphasize again this is more about

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,310
selling than explaining when you're in

00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,840
these strategic discussions it's not

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,940
just about explaining why this is going

00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,590
to work why this is the best path you're

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,900
selling this and if they're not buying

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,270
it then you are failing in your endeavor

00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,190
and we don't want that the nice thing

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,420
though is that graphic uol is fantastic

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,360
for abstractions for all the reasons

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,640
that I mentioned this could really in my

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,410
opinion be the the foundational language

00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,540
amongst your teams if you're if your

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,760
teams have any difficulty communicating

00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,220
on these sorts of things then I think

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:25,380
this might be a winning argument for you

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:26,700
let's excuse me so uh you got a large

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,930
organization a lot of teams they might

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,010
have their own sets of api's and

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,750
services if you can bring them together

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,640
in a common language that's good but

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,260
what's even better is that graph QL in

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,580
particular enforces all sorts of

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,500
standards and stuff that you would just

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,660
have an absolute nightmare enforcing

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,070
with regular human powered systems for

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,660
example you might have one team that

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,210
likes to maintain its REST API is with

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,950
certain idioms with certain naming

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,960
conventions and so on and you might have

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,480
fields that are the same field in

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,610
practice but in actually the same field

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,630
in actuality but in practice are named

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,340
slightly different things across

00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,270
different api's I'm sure we've all been

00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,460
here before it's a pretty standard

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:02,010
problem the nice thing about graph QL is

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,540
it's sort of they go from your teams go

00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,120
from maintaining a series of services

00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,580
that they have to answer to the

00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,740
clients for two maintaining a common

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,110
resource right with a standard and

00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,000
documented and enforced set of idioms

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,409
and best practices that are built right

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,299
into this data graph so that's sort of

00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:20,010
another thing you get to enforce this

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:22,080
sort of normalization across your team's

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,340
without really having to enforce it

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,340
without having to burn some of that you

00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,900
know a human those hours trying to

00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,610
enforce these policies and if you've

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,720
ever kicked back a PR because something

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,179
was named wrong you know what I'm

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,650
talking about all right but at the end

00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,940
of the day I think that the thing that

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,399
graph Caleb does for us that's really

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,679
nice is just gives us a in this in this

00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,720
arenas gives us a an abstraction that's

00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,929
just a lot nicer to think about so we

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,760
know what the diagram on the left your

00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:49,309
left is and we know what the one on the

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,659
right is and I would submit to you

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,460
conceptually speaking which do we think

00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:58,200
here is easier to have a discussion

00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,039
about all right so that's that's me so

00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,809
the recap here

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,000
I'd like you to recognize which

00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:04,559
technical discussions are strategic and

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,480
then spend the necessary time thinking

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,250
about those and planning those just as

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,890
you would the actual technology under

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,480
that you're going to be discussing

00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,679
because even the best technology in the

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,899
world doesn't mean anything if you can't

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,490
get it implemented I mean to understand

00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:19,830
who your stakeholders are what they care

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,830
about and why really get yourself in

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,450
their heads and just sell and I want you

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,279
to figure out how to speak their

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,440
language speak to their interests and

00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,510
concerns in a language that's common to

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,090
everybody and graph QL is a great tool

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,590
for that all right so come work with me

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,899
I work at a great tech startup we have

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,970
traction and funding and a lot of AI so

00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:40,230
if you're in San Francisco or anywhere

00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,640
else in the world and you like that sort

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:47,579
of thing give me an email thank you

00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,579
