Description: 
	Matt Debergalis, CTO and Co-Founder of Apollo, kicks off GraphQL Summit with a recap of the recent architectural advances in GraphQL, the various approaches companies are taking to adopt it, and what’s next for the technology.

The keynote explores the new layer of the tech stack called the “data graph” that maps all of a company’s data in one place. The data graph is driving extraordinary adoption of GraphQL and Matt explains how companies like PayPal, Audi, New York Times, and Priceline are using it for their most valuable products and business critical applications.

Matt also gives an overview of the latest advances in the Apollo Platform— from the open source implementation to Apollo’s managed cloud service, Graph Manager.
