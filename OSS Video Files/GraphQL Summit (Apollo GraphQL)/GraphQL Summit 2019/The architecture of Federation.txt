Title: The architecture of Federation
Publication date: 2019-11-02
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2019
Description: 
	As an organizationâ€™s data graph grows, Jeff Hampton, Solutions Architect at Apollo, explains how to use Apollo Federation to improve efficiency and scale GraphQL.

Apollo Federation is a new architecture for GraphQL, where you can now divide the implementation of a data graph across distinct, composable services. With this approach, different teams can collaborate across a single graph whose implementation is loosely-coupled.  

Jeff will cover the architectural principles behind federation and show how you can implement a well designed and structured data graph using Apollo.
