Title: Building a high performance realtime GraphQL API on existing databases (TANMAI GOPAL)
Publication date: 2019-11-03
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2019
Description: 
	I will talk about the approach we took at Hasura of building a GraphQL API that can leverage an existing database. You'll learn how we built a declarative authorization system and addressed the n+1 database query problem. With GraphQL making it easy to “join data” across tables, I’ll also talk about how we can “join data” between a table and an existing API.
