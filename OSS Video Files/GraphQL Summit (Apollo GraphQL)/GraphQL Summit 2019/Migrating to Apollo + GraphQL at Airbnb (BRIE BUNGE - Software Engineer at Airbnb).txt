Description: 
	You've heard that Apollo & GraphQL are amazing technologies that can help your organization build faster. But, what about all of the existing code that relies on REST endpoints? In this talk, we'll show how we migrated to Apollo at Airbnb. We'll cover our use of TypeScript, incrementally adopting GraphQL in our React + Redux codebase, and lessons learned along the way to help you make a similar transition at your organization.
