00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,200
hi

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,040
i'm monica powell i'm a software

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,799
engineer and community organizer who's

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,559
passionate about making technology like

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,400
open source more accessible and i

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,920
created a meetup group react ladies for

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,320
women and non-binary

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,160
react developers i'm super excited to be

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,720
here today to share with you how you can

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,599
use

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,160
mdx to supercharge your content creation

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,359
but what is mdx so you could think of

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,079
mdx as

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,200
j having the ability to write jsx inside

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,520
of markdown

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,840
so when you are using this term ndx it

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,239
can refer to either the syntax

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,480
of mdx or the library which is what is

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,079
used to convert mdx syntax

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,920
into jsx um and ultimately this jsx

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,480
um that was first written in mdx

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
um is compiled using tools like rabble

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,000
or webpack

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:03,440
in order to be usable by the browser

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,960
so let's see mdx in action by looking at

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,119
this example um so i like i said at the

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,479
simplest level mdx it supports the

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,200
ability to

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,960
write jsx and markdown um they

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,960
themselves burn gsx

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,759
it mdx as jsx and markdown for ambitious

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,439
projects

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,040
um and so the slides that you see here

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,920
today are written in

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,479
mdx um and in this particular case i'm

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,840
using

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,479
a library called mdf ndx deck

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,880
live code to show how you can use uh

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,280
react components within markdown files

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,000
um

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,280
also more specifically mdx files to add

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,759
rich interactivity

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,399
um so this whole presentation is an mbx

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,600
file

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,880
um in here i have uh the plugin that i

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,079
embedded so it's a

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,439
react component uh and i can

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,399
very uh quickly get responsive feedback

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,439
in terms of

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,000
whether or not uh the code that i'm

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,079
typing

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,600
in the editor is valid and whether or

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,640
not it is updating

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,399
um so if i take off of the h out of the

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,360
h1 you'll see at the bottom of the

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,119
screen

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,280
there's an error message that appears

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
saying that there's a syntax error

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,440
within

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
my code so this gives opens the door for

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
a lot of

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,560
possibilities in terms of being able

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,520
to create interactive content uh

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,879
and give people feedback as to how

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,599
certain changes that they make for

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,080
example

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,360
um to how they're using a component from

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,040
a component library

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,360
how will those changes impact how it

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,480
renders without necessarily them having

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,599
to

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,599
do everything locally

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,640
uh another way that you can use mdx is

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,280
to

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
embed uh easily embed third-party

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
content

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,200
um so there is a library called mbx in

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,519
bed

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,480
where you can embed um things like

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
codepen

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,400
or a tweet or a youtube video an egghead

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,760
video

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,959
um directly into mdx files um and

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,040
in uh that case you would

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
use one of their components so i own

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
this slide i'm using the

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,879
codepen component um and then passing in

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,840
this unique id that's associated with

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,959
the code pen

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,000
um indicating uh with the tabs props

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,040
uh which tabs i am interested in having

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,440
rendered

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,560
and so this just makes it really easy to

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,280
uh

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,400
embed a lot of the different types of

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,840
components

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,840
that mdx embed supports

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,799
so you may still be wondering why mdx

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,879
for me personally i had started using

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,040
mdx after hearing other developers talk

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,519
about the enhanced functionality

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,640
that mdx can add to websites and i was

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
especially interested

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,319
after seeing some of the interactivity i

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,159
think some of the strongest selling

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,200
points of nbx is that it really does

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,519
have a

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,760
strong enables a really strong authoring

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,439
experience for technical contributors

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,920
you can seamlessly import react

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,239
components into mdx files

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,959
and it creates more engaging interactive

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,319
content

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,519
with the ease of component ties

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,120
markdown um so you may be wondering how

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,400
do you get started with

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,959
mark with using mdx um so the first

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,440
thing

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,400
that you'll know is that if you are if

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,880
you have a project

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,360
that already has markdown files um in

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,440
order for them to be fully supported by

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
mdx uh those extensions should be

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,960
changed to

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,040
mdx um so there are specific

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,120
instructions on the mdx stock site to

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,280
set up uh with different bundlers and

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,560
and frameworks including webpack parcel

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,040
next create react that

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,040
gatsby and more but at a bare minimum

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,160
you will need to use mbxgs

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,240
uh react um and in the xjs um

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,080
index mdx package but i definitely

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,479
encourage you to look specifically

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,400
uh based on uh the frameworks that

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,720
you're using to see uh

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,479
what other requirements you may need um

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,080
there's also instructions on the in the

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,199
docs if you want to

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,759
uh create your own custom uh tool

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:13,280
to to convert the mdx appropriately

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,639
and then uh after you have mdx available

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,479
within your project

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,000
uh one of the first things i recommend

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,120
doing is uh

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,560
using the mdx provider to wrap

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,360
around the layout page for where the

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,680
uh where you're going to be rendering

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,000
content from ndx files

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
um and so the mdx provider allows you to

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,360
pass the components

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,560
you want to be available to all of the

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,880
pages

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
that are within the context uh so that

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,080
they're within the context in one place

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,280
um and so uh in this

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,639
example i um have

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,440
a provider that's wrapping all of uh

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,080
the content that uses this layout and i

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,600
am passing in the sign up and table of

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,960
contents components

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,560
uh to that provider so any um

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,680
any mdx files that i write that are uh

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,759
live within this mbs provider can uh

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,520
access the sign up component and the

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,720
table of contents component

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,080
uh without me having to explicitly

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,360
import them directly within uh that

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,479
lower level um

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,520
file um so i want to walk through an

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,520
example of

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,759
how i have used mdx um so for my longer

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,000
articles on my website i like to create

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,319
a table of contents so that readers

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,639
can have an overview of what to expect

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,039
in a particular article

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,759
um and so i liked adding these so much

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,720
that i would manually write markdown to

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,680
render

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
um all of the the content for the table

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,199
of contents

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,599
um and so i wanted to illustrate this uh

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,960
tip

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,720
of what a specific um post that i had

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,400
written looked like before and after i

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,039
started using the mdx

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,000
uh table of contents um so before i was

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,160
using uh

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,400
the nbx table of contents like i said i

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,840
was writing out all of the markdown

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,120
uh manually um once i had access to the

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,319
table of contents

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,000
uh component of via mdx

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,160
instead of writing out everything

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,360
manually within this markdown file

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,520
i'm importing a uh table of contents

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,360
component into the mds file

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,080
um and passing and the

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,479
table of contents um into the table in

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
the

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,120
table of contents from the prop um into

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,360
the table of contents component

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,400
um so then that makes it so that it's

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,599
actually rendering

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,479
the content um inside of

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,000
the table of contents a component that

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,639
you saw in the previous slide

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,440
um and so what does that look like um so

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,680
i have this

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,199
component table of contents um it has

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,039
its own styling

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,120
um and it's expecting the headings which

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,000
i said are the table of contents from

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,560
the props which

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,160
is something um that on my site is

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,879
available for each article

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,800
um as i'm using gatsby um so i'm getting

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,400
that data back from graphql

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,400
passing it um from this specific article

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,160
into this component um and then this

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,879
component is mapping

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,599
through each of the items um in the

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,960
heading

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:24,240
and uh creating a new list item

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,080
that links uh to the specific

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
part of the page so there's an anchor

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,319
tag for each of these

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,319
items

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,120
so then um like i said earlier i

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,279
imported the

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,680
uh table of contents component into the

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,959
mdx provider so that it was available to

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,480
my article template um if you are using

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,959
gatsby you'll note

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,560
uh that in gaspi applications you also

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,959
need to import an mdx

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,360
renderer which is a react component from

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,440
the mdx

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,720
gatsby integration that takes compiled

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
mdx content

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,720
and renders it it's required if your mdx

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,560
content is coming from a graphql page

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,600
query or static query

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,440
i also updated the post query um here

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,920
to pass in that table of contents um

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,959
into the available data so you'll note

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,560
here that there's a

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,720
table of contents um and now that uh

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,120
data is available within this props dot

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,279
data.mdx

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,399
um and then uh which i'm passing it in

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,560
as the post

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,519
um and then for each um

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,399
for every time the blog post renders um

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,040
the

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,720
uh table of contents is getting pulled

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,920
off of the data that was returned from

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,880
this query

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,920
um and and uh then being passed along so

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,839
that as needed

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,200
of the table of contents uh can be

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,320
rendered

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,920
um and also if you are interested in

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,160
implementing this it's helpful to know

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,440
um in gatsby and other implementations

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,680
of the table of contents

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,560
um there's a depth variable that you can

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,600
pass in

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,000
um to uh pull in uh

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,160
deeper layers of subheadings so for my

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,480
um use case i only cared about the

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,279
uh first layer but the table of contents

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,440
um component

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,279
depending on how you write it can be uh

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
written to recursively render through

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,360
all of the headings and subheadings

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,079
so you would just need to update the

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,640
graphql query accordingly in order to

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,120
render all of the content that is

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,120
relevant

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,279
and so i wanted to show another example

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,640
of

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:40,000
how i used mdx in an article um

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,000
so i i

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,079
wrote an article about how to render

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,120
relevant icons based on content so on

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,959
the homepage of

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,519
my website i have an article that um

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,279
i have a component that lists some of my

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,760
more popular articles

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,480
um which you can see here um it will

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,800
actually link

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,160
out to the content um and so i wanted to

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,640
show like how did

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,360
i create these components um this

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,240
component

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,399
um in order to illustrate that i thought

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,440
it would be great idea to actually

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,360
um import this component into the

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,120
uh article that i was writing so this is

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,079
a fully functioning component

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
um and in order to do that i imported

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,880
the

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,000
article list component and i hard coded

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,360
passed in

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,880
the uh slugs tags and titles

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,600
for the articles that i wanted to render

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,560
so this um syntax specifically is what's

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,880
being used to

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,880
render um the above code

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,240
um and so something that i did

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,279
uh within my markdown file which you can

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,399
see over here

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,320
um so i uh our mdx file is so i have my

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,519
front matter which i normally do for my

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,200
mdx files

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,120
um and then i have just regular markdown

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,639
and then when you get to line 20 you'll

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,760
see that i'm importing

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,240
this article list component um and then

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,360
here

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,959
is uh where i was hard coding the values

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,320
um which is what you would see

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:10,320
rendered and then down further below

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,519
is um i have some code fences

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,240
uh to show uh readers

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,839
what i rendered above uh with the code

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,240
that was used to render what was above

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,000
um without me with uh out actually

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,880
rendering it i'm still using the the

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,720
code block

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,040
um so that jsx uh the jsx isn't parsed

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,120
as

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,800
a component um and so i

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,040
like i mentioned i imported this article

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,160
list directly into the mdx file

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,839
um so i did not use it uh as an import

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,000
inside the mds provider

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,360
um and so i would generally recommend if

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
there's a component that

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,600
you aren't not going to keep reusing uh

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,760
throughout a lot of different files it

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,600
makes more sense to import it directly

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,200
but if it's a component that you

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,680
will be sharing um

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,200
through numerous files like the table of

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,399
contents then i would recommend putting

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
it in the provider so that it's

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,320
available

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,000
um and um on the actual site the uh

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,680
article this component is getting the

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,880
data passed in programmatically through

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,920
graphql query

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,959
um but for the content uh that i wrote i

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,079
used it i used hard code and data um as

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:25,440
uh that which made it less complex

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,440
uh to get the the component to render

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,160
um so let's walk through how i

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,200
added this timer to uh this slideshow

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,320
presentation

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,480
that i am currently presenting so

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,760
we can pause the timer and we can

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,440
restart the timer

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,240
um so if we go into the

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
code um you'll see that i have this mdx

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,120
provider

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:56,160
um which has a countdown

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,800
component um and so

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,680
similar to what i was showing before i'm

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,880
passing in

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,160
a different uh components

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,240
uh into uh the

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,839
mdx provider so all of the components

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,199
that i'm interested in packing into my

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,639
slideshow

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,839
are going into this md components

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,320
uh variable um and then i'm passing in

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,639
the

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,920
uh nd components as components to the

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,800
mdx provider

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,760
um and then that is now available to my

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,160
slideshow

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,320
um so in my slideshow i have a

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,279
this countdown notation where i'm

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,560
referencing

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,120
um the the countdown component and that

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,240
was

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,639
imported into uh

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,880
into the mdx provider um so let's see

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,920
what that actual component

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,800
the countdown component looks like

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,199
um so please note that i got uh the code

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,000
for

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,320
this component from 30 seconds of code

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,920
um in search countdown and this came up

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,680
um so this code uh is uh also proof of

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,000
concept that you don't have to

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,000
write components necessarily a specific

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,320
way to be usable within

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,399
um markdown um so you'll see for the

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,000
countdown component it can take in hours

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,079
minutes and seconds

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,920
um so in my case i just passed in a

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,680
little fall one minute in

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,880
30 seconds uh but you can

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,040
i passed

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,560
in like four minutes and 30 seconds and

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,440
then it was going to

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,920
update uh the presentation um so that

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,120
the

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,839
uh time that's displaying on the

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,160
presentation

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,279
is uh correlated with what was passed

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,320
into the props

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,160
um and also you will note that this is

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,360
the mdx file so there is

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,839
um markdown um and uh

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,079
also this jstacks network is what we're

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,440
seeing

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:57,360
let me comment that out and so then

00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,800
um if we go back to the slide

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,880
and refresh um you will see now that

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,639
it's updated to four minutes and 30

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,120
seconds um based on the update we just

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,600
made

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,240
um we could easily get rid of this extra

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
um

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,720
character bracket that is appearing

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,959
um so in summary

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,639
i i wanted to illustrate that nvx can be

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,920
used to provide a better developer

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,680
experience

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,279
and to enhance content that has been

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,040
written in markdown

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,040
and really the sky is the limit in terms

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,320
of how mdx can be used

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,959
uh to enhance markdown um so in enhanced

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,480
content

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,160
um so this is just really like

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,959
scratching the surface of some of the

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,759
things

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,120
that you can accomplish with mdx and how

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,880
and so some of the resources that i

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,399
think are helpful for people who are

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,600
interested in

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,320
looking more into mdx are the

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,079
storybook documentation uh for if you're

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,199
creating a component library

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,000
um their document a project

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,600
actually supports writing docs in mdx um

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,639
so that's something cool to look into if

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,320
you are

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,199
writing component library or looking for

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,000
more ideas as to how to use mdx to

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
illustrate how to use different pieces

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,600
of code

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,559
um and there was also this great article

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,280
about nicki moment

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,319
on how they um approached creating

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,679
nested

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,959
table of contents and i thought it was

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,559
really helpful to see how they

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,439
approached the recursion

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,079
um and then prince.da wrote a cool

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,360
article

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,960
about writing uh these call out

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,480
components uh with mdx which is

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
something i ended up doing on my site

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,559
and i think it's a

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,480
something you should check out if you're

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,280
interested um in seeing the different

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,039
ways that you can

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,240
extend uh mds components to be more

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,280
flexible

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,280
um as well as the

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,120
i wanted to mention mdx embed which i

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,080
use within this presentation

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,840
um as well as next mdx stack which is

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,640
actually what this presentation was

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,400
built with

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,840
um and then a cool plugin that i've been

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,520
meaning to

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,520
use more is prism react render

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,640
um so definitely i would say those are

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
good places to

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,760
check out um in addition to the official

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,360
mdx

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,840
documentation so thank you so much

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,480
for listening to my presentation today i

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,679
hope you learned something new about mdx

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,240
and i would love to hear on twitter uh

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,160
what your experience with mdx uh ends up

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,120
being like

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,160
thank you so much for a the talk b being

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,120
so fantastic

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,280
and see you coming in for this q a thank

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
you

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,360
people are asking me to personally hype

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,640
them up for you free 99

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,400
any day of the week i will be your

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,480
personal hype man

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,400
i appreciate it um so uh one of our

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,640
first questions is actually coming from

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,520
kurt um what are some of your favorite

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,880
custom command

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,559
components you've seen in the wild i

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,520
know you went over a couple there uh

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,720
with prince's call

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,559
out and and some of the mdx next or the

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,760
mdx deck stuff uh is there any other

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,600
custom components you've seen that

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,880
really blow your mind

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,919
um so i really like um josh

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,679
w humu they have uh

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,919
on their website where they teach web

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,000
development they have a lot of examples

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,440
where if they're

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,360
teaching a concept they'll have like the

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,160
actual component embedded inside so you

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,000
can see

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
um what it actually looks like in

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,440
practice so they have an

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,559
article about um how to add sound

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
effects when someone clicks on a

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,120
component

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,039
and you can actually experience what

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,039
does that sound like in in

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,280
uh what's the overall experience within

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,400
the article um and i've also

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,440
seen really cool um implementations

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,280
of um which i had mentioned like um in

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,919
the in my presentation

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,480
about how you can have a live code

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,200
editor

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,200
um as well so um formidable they have an

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,360
open source library called react live

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,200
um where someone can quickly like edit

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,799
um code and see how that changes the

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,640
output which is also something that um

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,880
josh does a lot on their website

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
um so those are like some of the things

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,120
that i like just like being able to get

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,840
more like

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,480
um hands on in terms of um

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,200
knowing like how something works so for

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
me the

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,320
most i think interesting custom

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,480
components are ones that are

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,159
being used to like teach and educate um

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,080
so not necessarily like a specific

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,000
component

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,679
yeah i agree i think one of the the

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
coolest pieces of mdx is it really

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,200
supercharges education right like

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,960
there's so many cool things you can do

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,960
with the content that you pull in and

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,880
i think one of my favorites is uh the

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,200
scrolly telling idea where

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,480
you know there's this kind of live you

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,120
know updating

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,200
uh component where you know it gets feed

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,480
that data as you as you scroll down um i

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,280
think that's really one of my favorites

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,280
for sure

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,400
um one of our next questions is coming

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,320
in from linda

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,880
what was the first thing you used mdx

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,600
for and how did you get started with it

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,960
yes so um when i first started using mdx

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,000
it was within the concept

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,480
of the um context of a gatsby website

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,640
um so i did some research to figure out

00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,280
like what is the process um to convert

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,400
from

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,679
uh just using markdown to using mdx and

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,559
a lot of it was like switching out

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,799
plugins

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,960
um i actually have a talk on egghead

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,919
about the process of how i migrated to

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,039
mdx

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,880
um and so in terms of uh

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,640
doing that i made some updates um like i

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,760
said to the plugins and then i was able

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,799
to start using mdx and one of the first

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,480
uh components that i made was like

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,080
borrowing a slider component from

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,679
another website um

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,200
so that i could just like test out like

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,440
what does mdx um

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,559
look and feel like and then um after

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,720
that i moved

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,919
on to upgrading my code snippets so

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,280
making it so that

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:45,280
um they had uh like more information

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,080
uh available um for for users than what

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,320
i could default

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,440
have like with regular code blocks

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,159
outside of um

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,559
mdx um so those were some of the first

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,320
uh

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,919
things that i did with mdx on my site

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,559
yeah i feel like a lot of people's kind

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,240
of first soiree into mdx was within the

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,720
gatsby ecosystem so it's really cool

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,640
that

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,919
you know it it really started to catch

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,440
on from there and now you see it out in

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,559
the wild from you know within all of the

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,840
ecosystems and

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,120
it's definitely something that i've you

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,080
know put a lot of thought and time

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,960
behind it's it's

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,799
definitely one of the cooler

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,240
technologies to to start to get involved

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,840
with and and it doesn't always have to

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,480
be for education right it can be how you

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,080
source your

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,600
you know your blog it could be how you

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,520
source kind of any kind of

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,280
you know on-the-fly content can you know

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,760
come straight from markdown and and you

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,440
know

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,720
fit right into the ecosystem you needed

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:35,039
to definitely

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,960
and then we have they're pouring in now

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,880
okay we got another one from kurt what

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,159
is the first thing you use mdx for and

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,360
that and how did you get started with it

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,760
i think we already kind of answered that

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,640
for

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,200
you know with gatsby um another question

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,360
we have

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,760
here because the sky is the limit with

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,880
mdx mixing many components do you have

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,280
any experience

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,240
with pitfalls using it things developers

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,559
starting with it should avoid doing

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,280
that's a good question um i guess i

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,280
would

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,840
be careful about like if you are using

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,960
the the mdx provider like being mindful

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,039
of like what you're

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,400
passing in so that you're not having a

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,200
lot of unnecessary

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,200
um imports um

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,880
potentially you could have some like i

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,240
guess conflicts between

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,080
um if you're using i'm not sure like

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,080
what happens if you use

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,720
uh with mdx you can like override

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,480
default things within uh markdown so

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,799
like if you have a pre tag

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,400
um or a new paragraph you could have it

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,919
so that there's a custom component that

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,360
renders every single

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,400
time uh that uh

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,559
that type of uh content is is

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,080
created um so potentially you could have

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,840
like conflicts i would say if you have

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,400
like a custom component that's supposed

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,880
to

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,799
um interact with the same uh thing that

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,279
you already have like other logic for

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,840
but

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,960
um i would assume that that would

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,320
probably be pretty

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,480
obvious like as you're developing um

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,840
but i'm not sure like what other like

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,440
problems someone might run into that are

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,760
specific to mdx that

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,120
um you might not encounter you probably

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
encounter similar issues i would think

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,120
with

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,640
um react yeah i think one of the only

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,919
like off the top of my head things that

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,799
i can think of that i've run into

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,679
recently

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,200
uh i was sourcing mdx from sanity or i

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,080
was sourcing markdown from sanity and

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,640
they had the code

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,360
block set up uh and when it when it came

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,919
to

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,480
uh process it into the mdx there was a

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,720
missing

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,960
ending tag in one of the code blocks and

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,480
it was trying to parse it into the mdx

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,480
and it was failing because it was saying

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,400
that there was a missing uh

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,080
like final tag to throw into the the

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,240
custom code block that we were getting

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,760
so you know having something in mind to

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,520
kind of check and make sure that your

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,720
code blocks are set up and that it won't

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,840
kind of break while it's getting

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,520
transpiled into

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,360
into mdx has been one of the big kind of

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,360
stumble blocks i fit oh

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,640
yeah that definitely is true i know for

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,400
me i have had

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:57,279
issues with like syntax um and

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,640
the i ended up using next mdx deck for

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,480
my slides um so

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,039
all the slides i presented were um built

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,720
with mdx uh but before that i was using

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,240
i believe the mdx deck and i was

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,559
having a lot of issues because the hot

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,240
roll uh reloading was kind of finicky

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,760
um and then i would have like syntax

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,880
issues and like it doesn't

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,240
fail gracefully um so that is definitely

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,960
something that i think

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,360
comes with uh using mdx of just like

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,600
being

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,039
cognizant of that but depending on your

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,360
um environment

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,039
it may be easier for you to navigate

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,600
that like i found with

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,080
next i've had like pretty good errors um

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,400
if

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,159
i do have syntax issues so that i can

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,760
like get to the root of it and solve

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,720
them quickly

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,000
definitely um cool so i think that's all

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,279
the time we have for questions today

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,360
