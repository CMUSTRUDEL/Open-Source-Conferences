and and yeah to be having uh this kind

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,199
of

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,039
announcement here at apollo day it's

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,960
gonna be uh a lot of fun i'm very

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,160
excited to dig in ask you a ton of

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
questions

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,680
uh i guess really to kind of start this

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,519
off uh

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,039
let's tell folks i guess like why we're

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,520
here what is it that we're gonna talk

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,800
about today

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,040
well so um for the last

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,960
year or so we've been developing a new

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,879
way for you to write queries

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,719
and author queries with graphql and

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,320
apollo that

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,079
lives in studio and it's called the

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,680
explorer and

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,160
we shipped it in the summer and ever

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
since we released the explorer we've had

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,000
it in our sites

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,520
to bring that experience to folks as

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,280
they develop locally

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,199
and so what my team has been working on

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,120
the last couple of months is

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,040
introducing this new concept to studio

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,880
that we're calling development graphs

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,119
that allow you to use the explorer and

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,920
some of our other tools for development

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,280
time

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,600
against your local hosts says you're

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,799
working locally boom

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,479
which is amazing uh when when you think

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,600
about it so

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,280
this is going to get into a whole

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,640
question which i'm dying to ask you

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,360
about but like

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,479
everything kind of revolves around graph

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,759
and like that doesn't

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,799
stop uh like in like a production

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,320
environment

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,079
and like you know like yeah of course

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,960
like a lot of people are invested in

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,200
that but

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,960
even in the local development world

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,720
there's a lot that's happening

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,079
around a graph that's running right on

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,000
your computer um

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,320
and yeah exactly and so

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,399
um yeah i'm curious to hear like yeah

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,000
how did this idea like come about let's

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,920
talk a little bit more about the graph

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,600
and the importance of it and just like

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,960
what what made you all decide i mean

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,320
you've been doing it for the last year

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,880
to say like hey

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,439
not happy with the with the experience

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,719
of

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,399
of uh querying um you know let's let's

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,879
make it better and then like

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,879
how did you get to that next jump of do

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,760
it local

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,120
yeah well okay i mean the answer is a

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
few different

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,680
problems

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,160
um i mean the original source of

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
inspiration is that

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,360
apollo wants to be the place where you

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,280
come and do

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,720
development that's why we build apollo

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,720
client apollo server that's why we have

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,360
this whole plethora of devtools

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,879
and that extends to studio studio is not

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
just kind of like

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,040
a place that gives you information as an

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
afterthought it's a place where we want

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,920
to have you actively working

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,519
engaged we really felt like one of the

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,480
most direct ways to do that

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,959
would be to bring access to the graph to

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,000
studio so you could come to studio as

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,040
like a console or a terminal or like a

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
portal

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,120
to access the rest of your data

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,239
so that was something that we knew that

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,239
we wanted

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,560
and what we started by doing was going

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,040
out to the community and saying hey

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,760
what are some of the things that are

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,879
great

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,800
and some of the things that are

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,800
challenging about the current ways that

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,959
you access your data in the graph

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,480
because there's a whole like array of

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,760
things that people do people use

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,319
graphical obviously

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,680
playground both great tools people use

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,640
those

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
insomnia people curl on their terminal

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,879
like there's a whole

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,799
array and so we talk to people who are

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,159
new just learning graphical we talked to

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,840
people who've been using it for years

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,640
and we tried to get a good understanding

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
of

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,080
what works well and what doesn't about

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,959
those options

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,879
we did some research and um in doing

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799
that we kind of came away with this

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,599
realization that like it would be really

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,599
helpful if there was a single place

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,000
for all sorts of people to access data

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,959
developers clients photographs maybe

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,040
even

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,720
product managers and like designers and

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
other people related to the product

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,480
development workflow that aren't

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,000
in the code necessarily it could be

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,560
really helpful if there was a single

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,400
access point for your data across all

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,280
your environments that was

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,480
predictable easy to set up accessible to

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
people who might not be

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,759
absolute experts with the syntax and

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,479
that

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,919
all that research kind of led us to

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,320
develop the explorer

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,759
which fundamentally is like a query

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,199
building ide

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,800
but a lot of what we've tried to build

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,440
into it has been tools to help you

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,560
navigate really big graphs if that's

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,400
your situation

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,080
where you might not know the precise

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,520
location of everything in the graph but

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,960
you kind of have a general sense that

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,160
something's there

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,080
or write queries if you were

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,320
technical enough to be interested in

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,600
that but maybe not an expert in the

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,840
language like

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,520
one of the most satisfying feelings i

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,639
had in this whole project was when i

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,800
showed our boss

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,639
who's an engineer and technical but not

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,560
writing queries every day

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,639
and he's struggling with the language

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,240
trying to type it out and i was like oh

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,080
just click some of those plus buttons

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,080
and you can do the whole thing

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
not even typing a single keystroke at

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,960
all it like

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,639
it bring it like empowers people who

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,320
wouldn't otherwise be able to access

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,880
data to like access the data in their

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,199
graph

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,000
yeah i love that and so while while

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,759
we're

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,520
uh talking about this i'm actually going

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,120
to just bring up explore because i feel

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,039
like we've talked it up and i'm sure

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,680
folks would uh like to actually take a

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,120
look so

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,199
before we get into what we're going to

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,520
talk about which is local graph

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,240
i'm going to actually open up uh like a

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,919
bigger graph

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,039
a project something that's well i

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,360
shouldn't say bigger but like something

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,680
that's been pushed to production already

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,560
uh and then we'll circle back to the

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,080
local graphs

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,600
here in a second uh because just because

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,400
i thought it'd be really cool for folks

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,840
to get it

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,560
i'll look at this so what i'm gonna do

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,919
is go to like the example co

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,840
i think they have or actually

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,440
gets to um i guess like the star wars

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,039
i guess i can open any of them let's

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,560
just open one of mine

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,560
is an example code you want to look at

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,919
that one oh that's where it is

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,080
okay ample co brown yeah let's do oh

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,960
here we go star wars

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,720
so when we're in studio uh it's gonna be

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,039
explore right here this tab

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,160
boop we click this open and then it's

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,000
gonna look

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,280
pretty similar right so it's not like

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,520
super surprising

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,600
uh shouldn't catch you too off guard but

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,919
uh yeah it's gonna be something you know

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,400
that

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,319
uh uh should have some familiarity to it

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,400
with a lot of awesome stuff

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,240
baked in uh and i'd love that that is

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
the best part you know i know exactly

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
where i'm going to handle my operations

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,199
and my value

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
my variables uh or headers and my

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,240
response is gonna boop

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,360
pop right up so you know this is explore

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
this is what we're talking about for

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,000
folks who might not be

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,759
so familiar uh also uh danielle

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,840
uh actually did an awesome stream with

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,759
me and that's on youtube so definitely

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,960
check that out yeah if you want like a

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,919
kind of deeper dive

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,199
and or but we're gonna cover quite a lot

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,800
of awesome

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,240
anyway right now um cool so i guess my

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,360
my next question here

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,000
uh is we we've talked about um

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,919
why it's important to be able to access

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,280
your graph why the accessibility

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,280
accessibility of a graph is is paramount

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,319
right like and and to be honest

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,120
i feel like the community we got to a

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,800
point of like

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,400
good enough and and that happens

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
sometimes in open source and

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,599
it's tough you know you have people

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,000
maintaining these amazing projects

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,560
graphical playground they are amazing

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,039
for sure but it gets hard um to do that

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,319
so

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,880
for apollo to be able to

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,960
create something you know taking it a

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
step further and really saying okay like

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
it's not

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,120
important enough to look at the data

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,400
like there's a lot of other things we

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,080
need to do make it like

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,160
that more comfortable to people who

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,479
aren't comfortable writing queries or

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,360
work in graphql all the time make

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,319
care and more but i'm gonna let you talk

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,759
about that

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,720
um so i guess uh a good thing to do now

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,000
is maybe we set

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,240
up a local we we set up like a a local

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,639
graph and go through that

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,840
yeah let's do it okay cool awesome i

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,560
love it so folks uh what i have going on

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,280
uh here is not that that is the wrong

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,800
window

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,280
is this uh and that is uh

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
yes code what i have here running is a

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,120
project that

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,759
i built with trevor blades on uh stream

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,919
as well

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,960
i do a lot of things on stream uh yeah

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,399
and and it's called

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,159
uh jam spam and what it is is a fun app

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,839
that basically anyone who loads up the

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
page you can click buttons and you

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,399
basically just spam

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,760
each other with some fun sounds on his

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,440
downboard it's cool

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,959
uh it can get really bad because there's

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,120
no throttling so if someone gets in

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,040
there and really goes ham uh it gets

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,959
it gets pretty distracting but it's a

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,959
lot of fun uh i'm digress

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,959
i digress so what we have here is a

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,480
gatsby app so this is the client

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,000
running on localhost 8000 and this is

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
already running

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,839
i come here this is what i'm talking

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,839
about and if i give it a good old

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,480
there you go folks a good old hey or

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,600
maybe

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,160
and uh so yeah so we have this this uh

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,320
graphql app and i say let's make this

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,800
you know let's open this as a local

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,519
um you know a dev graph and uh see

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,600
what we get what we can do with it so

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,880
i'm gonna jump back into explorer

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,120
and go to my own personal uh

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,040
account here and then i'm gonna create a

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,920
new graph but not a new

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,680
graph kind of like gifs and repositories

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,519
i'm going for the dev graph here so i'm

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,680
going to do new dev graph

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,560
uh and this one is going to be jam spam

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,640
boom and here i'm going to say uh uh

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,320
development and you can

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,680
notice here that it's actually asking

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,600
for an endpoint

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,600
this endpoint is your localhost endpoint

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,320
and what port is the server running on

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,360
because

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,640
although we're in studio's ui we're

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,519
actually going to talk to our local

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,000
server

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,760
and get the benefits of explorer against

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,320
a graph that we haven't pushed yet we

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,079
just

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,519
you know i'm starting a new project i

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,120
spin it up and now the first thing i

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,920
want to do is be able to work with this

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,079
graph

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,279
and develop with it so boom first thing

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,279
we do spin it up

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,839
so that's it we're already in so now

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,399
we're inside of here

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,279
let's go ahead and zoom in on to explore

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,920
a little bit

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,600
uh just so that we can kind of see uh uh

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,880
closer what is it what is going on and

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,079
as a matter of fact i'm gonna just do

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,320
that we're going to just going to bring

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,399
up that size a little bit give a little

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,240
breathing room to our operation

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,240
so right now what all i have running

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,680
here really is this query so i'm going

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,680
to run it and you can see that it says

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,320
two connection i do have two tabs

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,519
this open that's why we're getting

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,880
action

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,160
um so what we can also do

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,200
if i expand out the window we

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,240
we can do much as danielle just said and

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,160
query through

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,800
as you can see under query we don't have

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,920
many fields but if i go back to root

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,360
we have mutation i have subscriptions

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,959
too which is really cool danielle do you

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,640
want to elaborate for me on

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,760
why subscriptions are so cool

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,320
we've built kind of a experience

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,560
in the explorer to handle subscriptions

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
that

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,680
helps you see both subscriptions and

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,079
your other operations at the same time

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,480
which we feel is pretty valuable because

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,480
whenever you are running a subscription

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,800
and you're in local development you're

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,399
almost always running a mutation against

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,000
it to affect what's going on in

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,519
subscriptions and we just felt like it

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,360
was really important for you to be able

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,040
to see these things together

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,399
so subscriptions is cool because we've

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,079
built an experience

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,839
around subscriptions in the explorer

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,040
that's tailored to

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,560
folks developing especially absolutely

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,600
and this is one of my

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,560
favorite features i'm often working with

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,200
real-time stuff

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,480
in graphql and as soon as you want to

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,040
test subscriptions

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
it becomes uh just like the the hockey

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
stick curve because

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,720
how you need a client you need a

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
websocket client to test it so

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,920
you have a couple ways to do that you

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,480
could just have like something that just

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,320
like an

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,760
app you build you connect to that just

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,440
console logs it out

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,440
you could start building the actual

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,440
front end of the project

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,959
um maybe you're not even familiar know

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,959
what the front end of the project is

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,480
going to be but not being able to

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,320
to quickly develop uh with subscriptions

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,480
has been a huge pain point for me

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,839
uh since graphql has been around so i

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,360
was extremely happy

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,000
to uh and so uh

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,560
yeah so we've got update the connection

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,399
settings

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,600
so is it because of um i need to go to

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,959
websocket connection yeah that's in the

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,160
advanced section here

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,440
under that like gray text ah there we go

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,120
so then i just

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,120
wow oh and it puts that in for me

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,839
it should be 4 000 but then i think you

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,880
have to do graphql to get the

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,519
subscription

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:12,240
right yep yeah let's save that

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,880
we run it and look at this folks so it's

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,200
going to pop

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,480
up here i need to let me zoom out just

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,920
so this is a little more

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,600
visible here so you can see it's

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,480
listening and so now what i'm going to

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,440
do is i'm going to hop over here

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,240
[Music]

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,959
i'm going to come back and look at this

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,440
here's our responses here are the

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:34,720
subscriptions

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,440
that i just ran inside of

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,839
explore this makes me just like alone is

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,240
like

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,519
make my money but it's free so no one's

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,920
going to take your money like you can

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,240
just use this which is also awesome

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,160
um yeah i said that and each

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,480
subscription when each mutation came in

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,320
and when it changed the subscription and

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,839
if you update the actual implementation

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,600
of your subscription those will kind of

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,160
fade out but still be around

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
for access as new things come in wow

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,839
that is

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,360
awesome amazing and we could take this a

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,240
step further right so

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,839
i went to the ui which was already built

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,839
and i ran this test myself

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
we don't want to do that and also i'm a

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,639
lazy developer so i definitely don't

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,560
want to type this out

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,320
but why don't we go ahead and let's add

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,040
a mutation so that we can do this

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,040
all from within uh uh

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,120
um within explore because i don't want

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,600
to have to do

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,279
so we're going to do we're going to get

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
back we're going to pass it oops

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,480
we go back we're going to add in our

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,199
type so it's going to start autofilling

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,440
you're going to have a

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,000
let me pull this over so you this is

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,920
also just mind-boggling so here i am i'm

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,320
adding look it's like updating

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,720
creating uh my entire mutation for me

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,760
so we're good to go there and then it's

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,480
also

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,920
done variable play sound type here so i

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,279
have to get the type i know

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,839
bop so we can do bop um

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,839
so this is good so let me fire this off

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,600
and you hear bob because i have the web

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,240
page open

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,079
so the subscription fired uh and then we

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,800
can see

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,680
um this is such a brilliant app these

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,440
sounds

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,519
i love this app it was one of my

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,720
favorite things to build uh we had so

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,240
much fun on the stream

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,079
folks i recommend going and checking

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,560
them out uh they're under the launch pad

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,959
playlist on the apollo graphql youtube

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,120
and if you want to see uh uh trevor

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,480
blades and myself actually get spammed

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,720
and people just like

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,000
i it sounded like i don't even know like

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,480
new york city like

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,680
uh rush hour traffic like oh it was

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,560
hilarious

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,959
uh lots of fun um but look at this folks

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,279
so

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,079
so it's it's preloading everything for

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,480
us which

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,199
is awesome but that's not all you can do

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,800
i feel like

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:52,240
uh the infomercial host but wait

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,880
there's more yeah

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,560
what else can we do uh because common

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,399
situation that i run into

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,880
is yeah i want this separated out like

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,920
this easy to add my variables and track

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,839
it but like

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,079
sometimes i want to share something a

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,240
query or a mutation that i've created

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,680
or vice versa which is someone has

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,240
shared one with me

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,839
but i need to change the variables in it

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,959
and i don't want to do like all this

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,800
manual typing

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:22,320
what would i do in that in that scenario

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,199
okay you see

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,320
there's a uh a context menu we call it

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,600
our meatball menu

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,000
those three dots meatballs i learned

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,600
fun facts three dots horizontal meatball

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,040
menu vertical

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,519
kebab menu ooh i was not

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,639
up on kebab menu i like it though that's

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,600
awesome

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,320
that's hilarious um so there's the

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,320
options

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,079
inline and extract variables and right

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,839
now your variables are extracted

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,839
so you can click inline variables

00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:00,480
look at that it cleared my variables out

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:04,000
and and popped them up so let's back in

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,760
just okay so it just popped

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,199
them in so now i can grab this and

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,559
drop it into black into jira into

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,439
anywhere vice versa i can grab

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,000
the query that ua is telling me uh

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,319
they're having

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,919
trouble with and it's they've already

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,160
pre-filled it with information

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,520
i've done my test now i'm ready to do

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,439
best with other variables

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,520
very common scenario literally like

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,120
every day of development and graphql

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,960
something you might run into

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,880
but now i'm going to extract them and

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,559
now

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,559
i can change that to whatever i want

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,160
and it just works and that is such a

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,120
powerful feature in time

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,559
saver like and this is a very small

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,679
example because

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,520
we have one one variable

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,200
what happens when you have variables

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,200
like where you're going to skip a query

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,000
given a certain circumstance and then

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,160
you have

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,919
uh more variables that are needed two

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,160
levels down because you're in github

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,200
repositories which have comments which

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,120
have something else and it's just like

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,480
it's not a big deal when there's one

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,039
it's a really big deal when they're

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,160
seven

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,880
eight and you're doing this every day

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,799
yeah exactly and the extract variables

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,120
is super useful when you want to

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,039
kind of copy a query and then get it

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,720
ready to put it into code

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,400
because usually when you're working with

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,840
variables in code you want to extract

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,799
the variables so you can change them

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,440
more equally

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,240
absolutely and what a pleasing developer

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,880
experience like

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,160
you know i just it just goes to show

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,480
it's like

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,799
it's not that like we're at the peak of

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,880
developer experience it's just like

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,640
uh for graphql like i feel like we're

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,320
just scratching the surface

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,080
which actually brings me to my next

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,160
question because you know we're coming

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,480
up uh on time and i don't i don't want

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
to

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,520
miss anything is there anything else

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,600
that we show off

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,080
uh about this local development and

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,559
again folks this is a server that is

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,080
running

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,679
on my local machine so it's amazing to

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,440
get this kind of power

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:11,679
um uh just like it's

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,679
wild okay but i digress

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,280
uh quick thing about that i mentioned

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,799
earlier that a big

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,280
focus of ours has been kind of

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,640
accessibility of the data graph

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,520
so that more people query it but um

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,559
the other thing that i forgot to mention

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,039
in that moment

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,799
is that um i mean half of our work here

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,640
is making graphql more accessible with

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,559
the explorer the other half is building

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,160
a power tool for developers

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,640
because this is fundamentally a

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,600
developer ide and so a lot of

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,600
our inspiration for building things like

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,880
inline and extract variables comes from

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,360
our experience

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,080
as graphql developers just being like

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,840
gosh we

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,360
really need this thing if this was a

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,000
click away we could be so much more

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
efficient

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,280
and that's exactly how things like that

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,320
get built absolutely and

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,480
when we talk about like a power uh

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,080
developer experience like we're not even

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,640
doing all of the things that

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,080
we do here we can turn on mock responses

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,360
by default you just go

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,919
you just put in a query and just go uh

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,600
you can uh get response hints you know

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,200
to make sure like oh wait yeah this

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,440
seems right this is the field i'm

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
looking for like this is the right uh

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,799
type uh

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,720
also something else um that you can get

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,400
with explore which i'm hyped about not

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,559
really doesn't make as much sense for

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
a local graph but for a production graph

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,559
which is latency estimate

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,000
right like that's huge for a developer

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,320
and i know i'm veering a little bit out

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,600
of the

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,520
the local uh experience but uh

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,960
that actually could still be very useful

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,080
information you know

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,960
um oh yeah

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,320
like get a sense of how long your query

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
will take to respond and what the

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,799
balance

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,240
right you can do that with the deployed

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,360
version of the explorer

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,120
yeah exactly and and i just you know

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,039
uh and then one thing else that we could

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,320
do which i don't have on here

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,760
is the show inline traces and this

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,520
is just like womb so here's what i'm

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,799
going to do i'm going to switch to

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,840
nom nom ramen because we did set up the

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,360
uh inline traces for this and so now

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,720
what i'll do i don't have a lot of

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,240
queries so you're not really going to

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,520
get the full

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,520
power of this but we're going to come

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,320
down here to traces and

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,960
boom look at this so it only has the one

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,919
property

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,360
but you can visualize over time like

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,120
this is going to break down

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,960
the entire resolver chain of your query

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,320
and show it to you in your your

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,360
uh query building editor and i just

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,400
can't even

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,080
like i just can't it's just amazing it's

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,840
so cool

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,760
development this will bring you back

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,600
traces of every query that you're

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,520
running against your local host which is

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,480
really helpful for debugging especially

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,799
this is

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,880
this has been on our wish list since day

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,880
one started the explorer

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,360
yeah it's in i see why because it's

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,880
absolutely and so that brings us really

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,559
up to uh the end the crescendo here and

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,720
if there was any parting words or

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,640
anything you wanted to drop on

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,480
the wonderful attendees of apollo day um

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,320
you know what should they do aside from

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,400
clearly start uh

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,440
using this if you want to speed up your

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,520
development

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,000
um and basically a lot of other things

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,600
but what else

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,799
i mean um so like i said before our my

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,039
dream with the explore

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,679
archery with the explorer is to make the

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,520
data in your graph more accessible to

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,159
people in your organization who would be

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,400
empowered if they had access to it

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,240
and one of the things we didn't even

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,679
have time to look at today which is one

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,919
of my favorite features

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,720
is a feature where you can see your data

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,600
not in json mode but in table mode

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,760
and see it more visually and i've showed

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,919
that to people even internally here who

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,360
are very used to working in excel and

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:59,600
their eyes

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:02,320

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,840
sorry their eyes light up and they

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,720
understand how this could be

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,600
useful to them um and i mean there are

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,360

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,960
