Description: 
	Talk from GraphQL Summit 2018 - Nov 8, 2018

Michael Watson, a Customer Success Engineer at Apollo, showcases how GraphQL and serverless work great together with the Apollo GraphQL Platform! Serverless enables you to not only isolate the resources feeding your GraphQL server, but also your GraphQL server. We're working on supporting Apollo Server running in various serverless environments like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions.
