Jason Lengstorf, Developer Advocate at Gatsby, is a developer, occasional designer, and frequent speaker. He’s passionate about building tools, systems, and training materials to create high-performance teams and apps. For most of us, “static sites” only work for simple sites, like personal blogs. But static sites can do so much more!
