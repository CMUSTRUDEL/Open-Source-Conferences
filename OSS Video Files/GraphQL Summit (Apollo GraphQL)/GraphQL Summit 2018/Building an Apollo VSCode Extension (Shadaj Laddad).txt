Apollo VSCode is a brand new, open-source extension that provides code completion, linting, and analytics data for GraphQL right in your IDE! In this talk, we'll explore all of the features of this extension, from writing queries faster to getting Engine performance stats displayed inline, and how to use them to optimize your GraphQL development workflow.
