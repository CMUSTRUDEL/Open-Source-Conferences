Description: 
	Talk from GraphQL Summit 2018 - Nov 7, 2018

Jake Dawkins, an Apollo Architect, focusing on making the GraphQL ecosystem easier to use at any scale. After putting multiple GraphQL services into production and assisting with countless more, Jake has learned a thing or two about how teams implement GraphQL within their organization.

Teams that adopt GraphQL see it become a powerful, yet critical part of how their applications work. The schemas that power these apps act as an important agreement between servers and clients. So how do you support such an important piece of infrastructure? With tests of course! This talk is a deep dive into how to test the Apollo Platform, giving you the security you need to go into production.
