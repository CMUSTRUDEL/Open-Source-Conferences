Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2018
Description: 
	Talk from GraphQL Summit 2018 - Nov 8, 2018

Søren Bramer Schmidt, co-founder and CTO of Prisma, is rethinking data access in application development from the ground up. Using GraphQL as a universal query language for all databases, we're enabling simpler data access with many benefits such as type-safety, cross-database JOINs and out-of-the-box realtime capabilities. This talk is about the challenges we've faced while building Prisma, such as the N+1 query problem, query optimization, reflecting database features in the GraphQL API design, building an event system for databases and more.
