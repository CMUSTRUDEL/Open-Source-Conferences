Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2018
Description: 
	Talk from GraphQL Summit 2018 - Nov 8, 2018

Johannes Schickling, co-founder & CEO of Prisma, explores why building applications in a type-safe way is the gold standard for application development. It comes at the cost of writing lots of boilerplate and, for GraphQL, keeping data structures in sync with the strongly typed GraphQL schema. This talk discusses the tools and best practices for building end-to-end type-safe applications with GraphQL, touching on topics like schema-based code generation, type-safe resolvers, Apollo Data Sources, strongly typed database access and more.
