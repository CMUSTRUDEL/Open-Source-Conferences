welcome everybody hello my name is Eve

00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:21,360
Porcello you can find me Eddie of course

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:24,779
hello on the World Wide Web so look I

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:29,310
heard graph QL Summit and I thought this

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,470
was a mountain themed conference so I

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,149
kind of planned a mountain themed

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,470
conference I've been watching these

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,269
talks today and nobody stirred we've

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:41,160
been talking about mountains so I'm just

00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:43,140
gonna go ahead with my presentation cuz

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,859
honestly it's too late I'm gonna do it

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,960
as planned

00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,809
I'm here to talk to you today about

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,320
teaching graph QL because graph QL and

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,239
teaching graph kill is my job with our

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,149
company moon highway my husband Alex

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,059
banks and I teach JavaScript node react

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,879
and graph QL classes we've taught on

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,150
LinkedIn learning and we're Apollo's

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,770
first official training partner and we

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,710
also write O'Reilly books not these

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,310
O'Reilly books these O'Reilly books are

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,050
about killing but these are Reilly books

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,040
these and Reilly books are about

00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:27,410
learning and at moon highway we think

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:32,280
that learning is better than killing

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:36,150
it's just what we think but we do think

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,530
that you can kill it at learning when

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,570
Alex did I moved to Tahoe City

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,730
California almost eight years ago we

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,050
learned something pretty interesting

00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,650
when we told people what we did for a

00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,710
living

00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,840
nobody really cared where we live

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,420
they're a ton of ski role models but not

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,580
a whole lot of tech role models but

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,760
there are people teaching in Tahoe all

00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,650
the time so I'm here today to talk to

00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,350
you all about what I've learned from

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,760
teaching from the mountains and

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:06,330
hopefully these tips will help you as

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,220
you teach others when you're learning

00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,009
something new there can be a lot of

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,750
frustration and that frustration is

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,210
there because the disc because of the

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,180
distance between where you are and where

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,670
you want to be you want to be at

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,609
the mountain and you think how do I get

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,439
there do I walk can I take a shortcut

00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:28,379
but I want to be at the top of that

00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,689
mountain right now and you feel like in

00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:32,849
order to be an expert skier you have to

00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:36,450
go buy all this gear you have to get all

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,030
this stuff and to be a graph QL expert

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,489
you have to go learn all this stuff

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,950
before you get started you have to get

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:46,319
all these NPMs you have to learn all

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,069
this unless and you won't be able to

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,799
learn graph QL unless you'd know it but

00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:55,109
before you do that and before you ask

00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,439
somebody else to do that I'm gonna

00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:00,269
suggest that you do something first

00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:05,099
think about what makes an expert an

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:08,099
expert this is Jonny Moseley he's one of

00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:10,590
the best mogul skiers ever he has a gold

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,200
medal to prove it but before Jonny

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,439
Moseley was doing the dinner role that

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,639
dude was focused on the fundamentals

00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,919
look at his body position right there

00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,250
he's focused on making the turns he's

00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,919
keeping everything perfect and the same

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,780
applies to being a chef you could throw

00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,319
a bunch of food on a plate and charge

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,120
people money for it but chefs who take

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,919
the time to learn the fundamentals can

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,750
create magic by focusing on simplicity

00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:43,079
experts are experts because they focus

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,290
on the fundamentals and ski instructors

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,810
know this so on your first day of skiing

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,939
they don't take you out here these

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,220
instructors understand how to instill

00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,799
the fundamentals from the very beginning

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,109
they have you sidestep up a hill to get

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,209
comfortable on your skis they have you

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:04,079
go slow and learn pizza and french fries

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:06,030
and they make sure that the fundamentals

00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,349
are in place before they introduce new

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:13,259
things too quickly when we teach we want

00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,389
people to learn obviously but if you're

00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:19,349
a teacher you're also in the business of

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:22,710
creating believers when we cement the

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:26,009
fundamentals we want to cement and spark

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,169
a lifelong love of skiing a lifelong

00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,760
love of JavaScript our graph QL or

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,980
whatever it is that you're teaching

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,520
we want people to have fun cuz having

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,590
fun gets results so when you focus on

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,990
the fundamentals of graph QL don't think

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:46,990
about the whole graph start slow think

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,300
back to the first time you ever wrote a

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,870
query using graphical it was probably

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,920
swappi

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,960
right that was so much fun and the first

00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,320
time I ever queried my own data with the

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:03,010
github API I was like what this is real

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,300
I can do this this is amazing and then I

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,460
played around with creating my own

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,240
schema and the stakes were really low I

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,290
could just focus on the fundamentals so

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,990
let's talk a little bit about the

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,340
fundamentals of classroom management so

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,740
a couple years I went to an avalanche

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,480
class which is a three day class where

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,470
you basically learn how to not die so

00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,600
kind of important stuff and what I

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,820
learned in that class is that whenever

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,970
you have a class and this is what he did

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,490
you're supposed to give out buffs so I

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:37,090
guess that's what you do give out buffs

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,800
I didn't run this by anyone but I'm

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:45,610
gonna just throw these out into the

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:48,360
audience horrible I'm really sorry

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:52,930
I'll apologize later in person for that

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,900
yeah nice that one didn't go as well so

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,880
here you go now once you have your buffs

00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,140
an important thing with skiing is that

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,040
you have to face forward you have to

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,620
point your shoulders downhill and the

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,370
same is true of teaching so let's say I

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,740
wanted to teach you about Apollo server

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,840
I'm gonna go ahead and require Apollo

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,870
server I'll start with my type desk my

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,940
resolvers I'll create a new instance of

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,680
a server and then I'll realize that I

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:25,030
have my back to the audience this whole

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,860
time so always face forward don't just

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,780
read code off the screen that's sort of

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:33,100
an easy one but an easy one to forget

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,400
another thing that's pretty important is

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,340
to explain all of your terms and all of

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,440
your jargon and one of those terms

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,670
that's pretty important in skiing is not

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,610
and what this stands for is get enough

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,960
aspect-ratio focus on your screen you

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:54,040
got to make sure that people can see

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:58,240
your screen a lot of times a presenters

00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:00,040
screen looks like this and if you're

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,010
trying to learn something from this

00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,980
you're kind of screwed so let's talk

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,390
about a couple of techniques that you

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,300
might be able to use when you're

00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,580
teaching graph QL to a group or to

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:18,250
another person so let me switch my

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:21,910
screen over real quick all right so we

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:27,040
should see the playground now and we're

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:29,790
gonna notice that that mirrored screen

00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,140
looks a little weird so we'll fix that

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,580
cool so the first thing we always want

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,160
to do when we're working with the

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,490
playground is let's zoom way in on this

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,020
thing you have only one screen so you

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,810
want to make sure that people can see

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,420
that screen at all times

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:48,820
you also can always choose to select

00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:52,750
this gear icon from the upper right hand

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:55,030
corner and depending on the room that

00:07:52,750 --> 00:08:01,780
you're in you can choose whether to pick

00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:04,210
dark or light theme let's see if my

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,010
internet works cool so you can pick

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,420
darker light theme and then you can ask

00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,180
the audience what's better what do you

00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,370
think's better darker light light all

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,710
right cool thank you very much for

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,450
participating in that so we're gonna go

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,240
ahead and write the query on the left

00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:22,480
hand side of the screen and remember any

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,330
sort of code you can zoom in until you

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,090
need additional space so I can say all

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:31,360
lifts I can grab the name as soon as I

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,729
hit play we can widen this up maybe zoom

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,169
it out a little bit but you have the

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:39,250
whole screen to work with so you can

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:41,530
always zoom in and out as needed another

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,169
thing too I'm gonna zoom in on this

00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:47,410
again I'm gonna hit enter on this and

00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:51,130
I'm gonna hit control space inside of

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:53,670
our selection set so control space if

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,770
you know about this the secret

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,990
that pops open the little drop down in

00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,240
the playground are graphical you should

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,790
tell other people about it so that they

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,800
don't have to learn from scratch so any

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,190
secrets that you know from when you

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,510
learned let people know another thing

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,240
that's a little tricky about the

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,810
playground is query variables and HTTP

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,820
headers

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,970
have you ever typed query variables into

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,210
the HTTP headers section I do it like

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,710
twice a day and then I feel upset make

00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,900
sure that you let people know that these

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:28,740
are two different tabs so that they can

00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:31,350
choose from both the other place that

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,570
you'll be working with in any sort of

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,420
demonstration or any sort of class is

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,070
with the terminal and again you can

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,720
choose a light theme for that as well

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:44,930
just make sure to blow this thing up to

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,350
you're gonna run NPM installed graph QL

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:50,970
Apollo server and whatever else you need

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,460
to but make sure that people can see

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:57,000
that and then when you hit enter it's

00:09:53,460 --> 00:10:01,830
going to disappear pretty quickly maybe

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,300
less quickly on a conference Wi-Fi but

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,980
just make sure that people can see those

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,930
commands because they want to know what

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,400
they are so they can run them alright

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,490
and finally let's talk a little bit

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,560
about vs code so if you're using vs code

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,990
or some other type of code editor

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,470
there's a few things that you can do to

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,240
make this screen much much easier to see

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,000
thing one is do you want to make sure to

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,560
pick a high contrast theme so something

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,650
that you can actually see the text

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,560
that's being written another thing that

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:37,890
I learned recently from taking some

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,930
egghead courses from john lindquist is

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,600
whenever what if they recommend for

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:46,050
their instructors is to select this view

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,580
panel and to change something here so

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,980
check out the left hand side of the

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,470
screen see the search and the github

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,420
stuff and all those extra notifications

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,180
those are kind of getting in the way

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,700
those are unnecessary for people to

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,680
actually learn about graph QL so what

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,740
you can do is you can select toggle Zen

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,270
mode and look at that it's very zen it's

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,810
very calm and all of that

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,120
extra

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,160
stuff is out of there people watching

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,680
won't be like why does she have 5,000

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,310
github notifications that's so weird

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,880
and then again you're gonna be going in

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:25,170
a game of zooming when you're working

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,660
with vs code so zoom in as far as you

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:31,410
can all the time I always like to do

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,990
this just to make sure that we are using

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:40,140
all of that real estate and as things

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:41,430
get bigger you can zoom out cool the

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,680
other thing I want to say here is that

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,110
whenever possible if you're teaching

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,060
somebody something new try to start from

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,190
scratch you're not always going to be

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,760
starting from scratch however it's a

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:56,010
really good idea to kind of take away

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,540
the idea that there's something magical

00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,690
that people have to know to get started

00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:03,540
with graph QL take them from scratch and

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:06,330
then they'll be able to apply all this

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,180
new knowledge upon this good foundation

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,610
with these fundamentals so that's a

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,140
quick little demo I also want to point

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:18,150
out one last thing which is in our

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:21,150
preferences and our settings so if you

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,970
take a look at the settings in your vs

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:27,210
code and scrolling down there's a ton of

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,940
these options what I did is for the repo

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:34,380
for this talk I put a bunch of these

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,970
user settings in that repo and the

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,130
reason I did that is because you know

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,950
those pop-ups that come up and help us

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,680
out a bunch when we're working with vs

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,780
code those are really helpful to us as

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,339
developers but those literally get in

00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,850
the way of lines of code for people

00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:53,640
trying to read them so we're gonna do

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:56,370
things like get rid of quick suggestions

00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,070
the mini-map at the light bulb things

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:01,260
like this and it'll make things much

00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,630
easier on the students I've been yelled

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:09,089
at before about this so that's why I'm

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:12,470
talking about it now all right so I'm

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,470
gonna go back to my slides

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,500
there we go

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,690
cool so we always in all of these

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,790
environments the playground in the

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,950
terminal in V s code we want to make

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,780
sure that we're thinking about the

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,390
people who are watching our screen and

00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:43,330
we want to make sure to include them in

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:46,660
the process make sure to do things like

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,940
start from scratch whoo do things like

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,770
start from scratch

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,580
minimize cut and paste and then zoom in

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:56,950
and zoom out so good screen work takes a

00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,610
whole lot of practice but you also need

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,020
a plan so this picture on the right here

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,780
did anybody see this video it's called

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:08,290
the crack and this guy named Cody

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:10,420
Townsend skied it now to see this having

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,390
ski fundamentals in place is kind of a

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,520
given but he also had a plan he knew

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,100
about the snow conditions he knew about

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,900
where he could put in turns and having a

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,210
plan is super important especially when

00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:25,510
you could like Jam your head into a rock

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:28,390
at any second so as a teacher you're in

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:32,490
charge of the plan and this brings us to

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:38,890
our next acronym here pal people only

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:42,120
want to know what your plan is so time

00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:44,830
management is super super important and

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,450
letting people know what the schedule is

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,040
for the day is a great thing to do at

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,140
the beginning of a class even if it's

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,120
two hours or whatever right up on a

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,950
whiteboard or whatever you have

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,840
available the schedule for the day

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,220
people want to know when lunches people

00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,660
want to know when the breaks are and if

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,500
you'll want to go and they get to leave

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,420
so make sure to let them know that then

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,160
you can do what you can do is write on

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,370
the board literally what you're gonna do

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,410
so today we're gonna cover Raphael intro

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,630
we'll talk about the query language the

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,600
schema definition language building an

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:19,450
API github authorization and once you do

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,480
that people think you have a plan people

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:25,570
will trust you and you'll make people

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,480
feel like they're in good hands and then

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,280
this also becomes a checklist and as you

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,060
move through the material you can check

00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:36,070
off these items so give the people the

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,520
plan and they'll take the journey with

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,520
you

00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:44,260
another super important thing you need

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,580
to consider when planning is time so a

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,530
lot of times the students you're

00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,540
teaching or their managers or whoever

00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,730
will come up with a list of topics that

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:56,890
they want you to teach and then they'll

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:58,780
tell you to teach it all in two days so

00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,730
all you can do at that point is figure

00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,010
out how much time you have and how to

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,010
break down the day or days of the class

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,890
so you can break this down for however

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,260
much time that you have and then you can

00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,630
break this down even further for every

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,880
section so you'll have a roadmap for all

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,620
of the things that you need to cover so

00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,810
you'll start with the easier things and

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,360
then you'll build on that as you go and

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,970
then you can mark things as required if

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,470
you want to so we can decide how to mark

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,440
something as required so we picked the

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,180
shrimp felt like an essential item so

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,010
went with shrimp so you can choose

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,710
whatever you want but figure out what's

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,600
the most important and then from there

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:41,350
what you can do is check off all those

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,240
items so this will help you out in the

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,740
class but it'll also serve as data for

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:50,560
future classes let's talk a little bit

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,110
about materials so our course materials

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,170
are easier to categorize when we put

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,320
everything into a separate bucket so in

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,270
our courses we have slides samples

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,240
exercises and labs and most things fall

00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:06,250
into these categories slides would be

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,000
something like a minimal lecture to

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:13,230
introduce a topic samples are small

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,850
demos they're already typed out and

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:20,170
they're probably in a code sandbox or

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:22,750
some sort of one-off file exercises are

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,970
more real-world so this is where you can

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,150
go more in-depth and build something

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:30,580
together so it's kind of like a cooking

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,830
show too you can have iterations for it

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,480
and pull baked things out of the oven so

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,340
if things are going a little slower than

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,460
you anticipate you can always roll

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,380
forward if somebody shows up at like 4

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,470
o'clock and they're like what did I miss

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,990
but you can help them with that as well

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:49,660
and finally we have labs where people

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,410
people can learn by doing so loud should

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,500
be open and

00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,060
and requirements based meaning that you

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,320
can give people a list of something to

00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,140
do and they can fulfill those

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,210
requirements if you have people of

00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:05,200
different experience levels you can give

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,880
them extra credit which people like work

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,810
toward they get excited about extra

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,450
credit and then you can have people

00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:16,840
volunteer to demo their solution so

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,370
these are typically the things that we

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,060
think about when putting together course

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:27,790
materials and probably what 99% of

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:30,220
everything falls into another so once

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,350
you have your materials together you're

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,270
gonna need to make sure that these

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:38,380
materials are resonating with your

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:41,050
audience so quick question do you know

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,740
what an audience who understands

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:47,830
everything looks like it looks sort of

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,540
like that and do you know what an

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:54,340
audience who understands nothing looks

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:59,230
like yeah big time you're not gonna know

00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:01,150
so you need to get a sense of if the

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,460
class is getting it or not so you can

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,960
ask questions you can walk around you

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,380
can talk to people one on one that's

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,750
super helpful but you should always be

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:14,860
evaluating you should evaluate early

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:16,540
evaluate often so there's always going

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,700
to be people and of course who ask

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,220
questions but not everybody is going to

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,770
because asking questions is super scary

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,200
a lot of times but if you create

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,990
channels for feedback some of which are

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,150
anonymous then that could be as simple

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,010
as giving people your email address then

00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,220
people can sneak questions to you

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:40,690
without having to raise their hand which

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,130
is again scary I also always give out

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,290
something like this a mid class

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,540
evaluation just to gauge this how the

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,780
course is going how things are being

00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:52,090
received sometimes I do this on paper

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,760
because people fill out paper they feel

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,800
like they have to and it works slightly

00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,890
better than a Google Form but either of

00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,280
those is fine keeping evaluations for

00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,200
every course means that

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,970
have to do less work later because

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,950
you'll figure out okay this is working I

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:12,740
don't need to worry about this but this

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:13,310
is stuff I can beef up or figure out all

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,250
right

00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:19,460
so teaching was something that was

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:22,130
pretty familiar to us and we were pretty

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:26,570
used to creating courses of all types

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:28,340
but the idea of writing a book was sort

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,990
of a weird one so when we started

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,880
talking to a Riley about writing this

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:35,600
react book we'd never written a book

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:41,330
before but we knew we liked the idea of

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,160
having our name on a book so we had no

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,350
clue how to write a book though so we

00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,380
realized we've created all these courses

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:51,500
why don't we just write it down write

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,900
down what we'd say in a class so

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,780
typically the first thing we do in the

00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,490
classes we say welcome everyone which

00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,620
might explain why the first chapter of

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:03,760
our react book was called welcome to

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:09,460
react and then followed that up with

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:12,470
welcome to graph QL that's real and we

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,840
decided that it's important even though

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,760
we hadn't done this before there's no

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,760
reason why you shouldn't write down what

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,100
you learn and what you know as you

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,410
already know there are tons of platforms

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:27,140
that you can use to share information as

00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:31,430
a teacher and the community needs you to

00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:34,970
do this so recently I looked at Google

00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:38,060
Trends to kind of get some information

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,920
about graph QL searches now this graph

00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,440
looks pretty good over the last 12

00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,020
months but if you start comparing it to

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,140
other searches it gets a little more

00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:51,530
questionable so react has substantially

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,810
more searches than graph QL and people

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:57,920
might not like this one but rest has

00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:59,930
more searches than graph DL as well so

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,210
in order to make this graph explode

00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:06,410
we're all going to have to share what we

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:09,020
know so there was a recent article in

00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:11,690
The New York Times by Adam grant he's a

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,610
psychologist and an author and in this

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,920
story he debunked a lot of myths about

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,060
teaching

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,150
the article starts with a story about

00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,920
Albert Einstein and around the time that

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,590
Einstein came up with a theory of

00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:28,340
relativity he decided he wanted to teach

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:31,490
some courses on the topic and the

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:34,790
courses didn't go so great it was hard

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:37,400
to get people registered and when a few

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:39,950
students did attend they smiled because

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,890
it's Einstein but they had no idea what

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:46,280
was going on so when he was asked how

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:50,390
the classes went a student said he is

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:52,490
not a fine talker and Einstein's

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,500
biographer said Einstein was never an

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,220
inspired lecturer and his lectures

00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,780
tended to be regarded as disorganized

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:04,100
which makes a lot of sense given on

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:07,310
Stein's hair and his office that's his

00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:09,770
real office so I found it thought a lot

00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:12,020
about relativity and thermodynamics but

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:15,950
not how to explain those concepts to

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:18,890
students and that makes sense if you ask

00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,860
Elon Musk to teach you about electric

00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:27,320
cars he might not have the temperament

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:28,670
to do so in the clearest way and you

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,410
probably wouldn't get a good answer

00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,080
about how to perform at the Super Bowl

00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:36,710
from beyonce she'd just say like be

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,690
Beyonce we tend to want to learn from

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,960
experts though because their expertise

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,640
seems completely effortless but studies

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,100
have shown that these experts might not

00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,200
be the best teachers partially because

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,920
of their natural talent but also because

00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,030
they're pretty far away from learning so

00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,640
let's talk a little bit more about

00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,860
learning at the University of Santa

00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,490
Barbara which has a campus that I

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:03,890
personally think is a little too nice

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:05,840
researchers recruited 124 students and

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,480
told them that they should study some

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,330
material on the Doppler effect and on

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,070
sound waves for about 10 minutes so none

00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:15,920
of those students had any experience

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:19,370
with the topic at all but they had 10

00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:23,030
minutes and then the students were

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:26,080
broken up into four groups group one was

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,539
asked to teach what they learned groups

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,039
you was supposed to practice

00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:34,630
multiplication exercises about sound

00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:36,970
waves group three was given a script and

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:40,600
was supposed to teach from that script

00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,740
and the fourth group was just asked you

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,610
know write down everything you remember

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:47,919
and a week later the groups were given a

00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,840
surprise test to gauge their retention

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,130
of the material

00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:56,049
guess what group did the best yeah the

00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,809
group that was told to teach the topic

00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:02,049
so that students learned better from

00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:04,120
teaching and in his article grant also

00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:07,210
points out that his teaching assistants

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,070
and grad students often yield better

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,070
teaching outcomes than tenured

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,539
professors so this would suggest that

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,909
not only do you retain information

00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:18,850
better but you might even be better at

00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:20,080
teaching it so I just want to say here

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,389
today that you don't have to be an

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,510
expert to be a teacher so don't wait to

00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:29,139
teach teaching is a huge part of

00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:31,000
learning now there's a lot of graphical

00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:33,460
experts out here today a lot of graphic

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,820
UL Einsteins and you have so much

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,519
awesome information but remember to put

00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,320
yourself in the shoes of beginners as

00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:45,549
you share all of this incredible

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:47,049
knowledge and to the beginners start

00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,669
teaching you're closer to the

00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:52,240
fundamentals and you have a lot of great

00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:54,389
knowledge to share but no matter where

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,250
you are on this journey as graph QL

00:25:54,389 --> 00:26:01,080
enthusiasts it's up to us to get people

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:05,409
up this hill and in the spirit of that

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:10,330
I'd like you to stand up let's all stand

00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:12,970
up so if it's comfortable for you to do

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:23,010
so let's stand up and hold up your hand

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:23,010
and just repeat after me I Eve Porcello

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:32,250
your name fun joke but your name do you

00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:37,950
solemnly swear that I will write a blog

00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:38,340
about graph QL that I will speak at a

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:44,550
meet-up

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:46,920
about graph QL that I will be empathetic

00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,260
to people learning by keeping it simple

00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,940
and approachable because why not help

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,980
other people learn so they can help

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,780
other people learn and I know that

00:26:52,980 --> 00:27:05,930
sounds kind of like a pyramid scheme but

00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:05,930
let's not focus on that all right

00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:13,410
[Applause]

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,940
thank you so much for having me drafty

00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,940
