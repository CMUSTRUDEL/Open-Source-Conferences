hello everyone welcome to the day - I

00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:10,100
really enjoyed yesterday's talks super

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,420
excited to hear about the apollo

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,070
platform i think that's gonna be really

00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,049
really interesting hopefully we can use

00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,219
that when it comes out I'm really

00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,270
interested to go home and take all these

00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,220
best practices we've heard from like

00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,740
github and Shopify and all these other

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,140
people and I really want that cogent

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,460
magic that Matt did yesterday or Adams

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,650
wrote yesterday seems really interesting

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,630
to me I hope you all have enjoyed

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,170
yesterday stock as well

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,850
so before we start it's fluff time so

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,360
this is a part for me this is my

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,610
favorite part

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,920
I can ramble about some things for me

00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,710
and calm my nerves so let's see how we

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,540
go it all started about a year ago when

00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,370
I got the job at Netflix I feel really

00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,860
lucky to be a part of such a really cool

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,239
team of we can start on this brand new

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,670
Greenville project which was really

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,820
really awesome it's always been fun to

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,960
be starting fresh so we explored lots of

00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,670
different tools and frameworks that we

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,500
won't be able to use internally we use

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,840
lots of Java we have some Ruby market

00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,920
services some note here and there we

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,210
rate up the pros and cons of lots of

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,979
these in terms of support maintenance

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,049
from our runtime team in core and all

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:10,450
these whatever else but of course we

00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:13,069
don't want to be left behind

00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,329
so we hop on the bandwagon we went with

00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:15,679
a follow on the client and on the server

00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:17,990
because it really rocks

00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:19,670
I will use react typescript throughout

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,590
we have very little in Ian's which is

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,729
you know I'm very proud of that yeah and

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:27,679
of course we used actual so our team

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,060
each lunch most the days together and

00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:30,409
when the start of the sebou project

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,539
everyone was really interested to know

00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:34,639
how it was going in particularly mostly

00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:36,619
this graph you'll section of it says it

00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:38,689
hasn't really been used much an hour or

00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,069
goes yeah so as we learn more and more

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,389
about it I would raved about cool new

00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:44,240
features or how the spotty different and

00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:45,289
rests and I'd realize this is happening

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,810
but I kind of been haired of the phrase

00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:48,979
of not being sold yet I'd realized I was

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,869
doing it but every time I talk about in

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,399
your future or something about retro I'd

00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:54,889
always ended with you know I'm not sold

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,310
yet a few months went by one of my

00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,509
co-workers

00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,310
I think controlled me into writing a

00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,409
call from proposal for this event as a

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,779
skeptic so that was pretty funny so I

00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:04,759
did do that I press it into the last

00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:06,259
moment as you do submitted the CFP it

00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,090
was like who are part server there's no

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,910
way they'll pick me

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,290
that's unfortunate so I do get picked so

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,910
the first thing I did was go to Amazon

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,040
and buy a big red field book I defined

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,950
and read it one of them you got for free

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,870
today which you

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,250
definitely read it's very great and the

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,500
presenter spoke yesterday as well for

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,700
the writers let's go get your dad it's

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,800
after that I progress things as long as

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,849
possible as you do and to distract

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,590
myself from time to time you go on

00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,450
Facebook and you browse and you see this

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,349
amazing ad for this event to remind me

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,370
that I should be working on my talk

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:37,290
instead so anyway here I am I want to

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,430
thank the organizers a lot this is this

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,500
place is really awesome and I'm super

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,489
excited to be here thanks organizers are

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,660
putting on such an amazing conference

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,610
and I'd like to thank you all as well

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,030
listen to me ramble about some fancy

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,230
grass maybe you heard of it so I hope I

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,549
can shed some light until I think that

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,370
what the power of graft feel really

00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,360
brings and if nothing else hope give you

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,340
some talking points to share with your

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,890
team maybe some skeptics of your own you

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,110
have in your organization the truth of

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,120
it is until recently I wasn't a very big

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,829
fan of draft Joe as I can probably tell

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,900
from the title of my slide over my talk

00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,610
I hadn't used any production capacity I

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,870
had even built any side projects with it

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,220
and to be honest how that goes looks

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,860
like this huge is bad they would come

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,720
and go like they often do but once I

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,160
started to dig into this really really

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,569
dig into it I noticed a lot of things

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,010
that I liked about weren't actually much

00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,420
of the technical parts to be honest I

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,739
enjoyed but it really allowed for an

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,690
organization and your and the teams

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,620
within that organization and I can see

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,040
the eliminating a lot of problems people

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,090
face day to day so since then my tone

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,069
has rest with change from being a

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,750
skeptic and to a graphical enthusiast so

00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,329
I'm super happy to be here today talking

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,220
about it so this is my face just like

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,049
this one I recently moved here from

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,850
Australia back in January I was living

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:42,930
there for the last five years so if you

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,850
wanna hear about some cool places to go

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,980
visit or want to learn some cool slang

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,630
please come chat with me I like beer

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,010
video games all the boring stuff and I'd

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,639
like cringy things especially so I'm

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,930
sorry if I make some bad jokes so as I

00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,829
mentioned earlier I do work on Netflix

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,049
and I've been been there about a year

00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,340
which is blown by really really fast I

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,530
feel really grateful to be part of such

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,790
an amazing organization I can't go and a

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,889
lot of the details but it's very unlucky

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,720
anywhere also ever worked and I've grown

00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:08,430
a lot individually as well as personally

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,769
professionally from being a part of this

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,329
organization so I'd like to tell you

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,489
what we do at Netflix and kind of set

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,049
the context for our organization in

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,250
particular so for the purpose of this

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,709
talk we'll just imagine there's two

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,060
tracks in terms of development one I'm

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,520
hopeful most of you will be aware of so

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,870
when you or I go home we make a search

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,070
on Netflix we get some recommendations

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,960
we have the banners the billboards off

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,990
on downloads all those things we refer

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,080
to that as the product

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,610
or streaming like Netflix calm so the

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,220
other facet which is more secret or like

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,600
unspoken team of people it's kind of the

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,830
organ that I said within called content

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,510
engineering you're from Dane earlier

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,130
yesterday speaking about it you heard

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,020
from Connor this afternoon and we're all

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,730
in that same organization but we helped

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,650
take an idea from these creatives around

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,820
the world help facilitate and scale all

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,650
the processes that go into like

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,380
producing these shows and a content that

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,540
eventually shows up on the product so

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,610
what does that really mean so let's say

00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,660
you want to make a band okay cool

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,000
probably to figure out what kind of user

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,470
you got to play what kind of drama you

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,790
need to find some other band members you

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,990
probably need a place to practice that

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,660
will know your parents or your neighbors

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,860
or whatever and that's just the start so

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,210
how'd you get your first gig do you need

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,860
like a promoter or do you like have some

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,870
friends that run a venue you need to get

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,010
your name out there somehow you record

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,120
their first album you need to produce a

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,500
very good to do Garage Band

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,240
you know how do you how do you do this

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,770
and then how do you work out who gets

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,120
page that lead singer get paid twice as

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,100
much just because of the bloody singer

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,300
that doesn't make much sense so the

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,830
thing is the list goes on and on and a

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,090
lot of things go into making a band and

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,950
very similarly a whole lot goes into

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,130
making a show or a title that eventually

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,450
shows up on the product so in short we

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,860
helped create all the Netflix originals

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,510
we are building a largest internal

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,740
studio in the world and you got to do

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,110
this in the way that will scale not with

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,300
people but with technology so we often

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,830
look at with technology we can use to

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,210
make this possible and we really think

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,540
that graphic will is going to be a make

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,610
a big impact in that realm so Lepik has

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,350
a lot of like large amount of teams and

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,730
it always grows each team has the

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,710
freedom responsibility like we heard

00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,930
about bit earlier to do this and build

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,270
things however they see fit this allows

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,040
them to build and innovate innovative

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,990
creative and empowers individuals to

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,720
make very creative solutions there's not

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,830
a one-size-fits-all solution so however

00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,330
this talk is going to specialise in my

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,100
team's perspective and experiences and

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,660
no buts no more more teams across the

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,820
entire organization some of even in

00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,830
Netflix comm are exploring the option of

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,880
using craft girl themselves and I'm

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,850
really excited to see if this is gonna

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,260
take off across the whole ecosystem so

00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,470
Netflix is called through again one more

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,960
time

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,460
unlike anywhere else I've ever worked we

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,720
started out sending DVDs to people in

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,680
the mail and now we're one of the

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,540
biggest shipping platforms in the world

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,990
so we didn't get there by playing it

00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,580
safe

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,010
so we pride ourselves on taking really

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,050
big bets this allows us to be innovative

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,580
explore and learn along the way no of

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,350
course not all these big bets they often

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,090
make a lot of

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,410
work really well we like the sunshine

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,730
these mistakes and shared them with the

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,860
water team so we can all then I grow and

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,510
move forward so our team is taking a

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,290
really big bet on graphed trail we

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,850
really think it's going to drive

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,190
productivity not only within our team

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,250
hope in the larger organization and a

00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,360
pretty drastic way so over the last year

00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,670
we've been building a single entity

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,290
graph we have a lot of different

00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,630
downstream data sources some are Java

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,000
JDBC so i'ma drop a rest somewhere no

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,220
micro services Ruby the thing is like we

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,890
don't really care we expose the graph

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,050
best suited to our use cases and our

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,880
products needs this is the rest of this

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,710
implementation details of how we it's

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,540
all that graph this whole just allowed

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,460
us to move very quickly and iterate on

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,140
our product to the best of our abilities

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,190
and allows us to see this data in a very

00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,830
different way than we're accustomed to

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,930
so as we've been showing off this craft

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,280
other teams may know it seems we're

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,600
super keen on using it themselves

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,190
they want to use our data they want to

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,480
use our graph and even better they want

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,180
to expose their own entity into this

00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,410
craft and make their own so it's really

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,440
contagious and people are getting really

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,550
excited about this idea but we are still

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,810
super early and are draining with a

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,000
graphic yo unlike a lot of other people

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,410
we've heard from so far so we solve

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,120
what's to learn and I'm super excited to

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,770
learn from everyone else here please

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,150
come tell me all of your ideas and I

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,950
would love to retain that in my brain

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,810
but I like to share like where we are

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,790
where we're headed and we'll go from

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,860
there

00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,910
so why should we care about graph QL why

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,290
are we have a hosting a conference with

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,240
too many scary people listening me talk

00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,490
about it at the end of the day I think

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,170
graphic roll is very good for teams so

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,240
it fosters team communication in an

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,410
unmatched way it radically improves the

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,670
way back in in front of engineers work

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,200
together and acts as a living

00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,240
documentation a similar source of truth

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,730
for your entire macro service ecosystem

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,170
just really powerful tool so let's stick

00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:23,040
it to I think a graph girls get four

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:26,360
teams you know maybe your team so this

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,000
is a big rock this also is a big rock

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,500
any guess what this is

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,900
so yeah these these are all monoliths

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,190
and maybe to an unpopular opinion

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,500
I actually think one of us are very

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:41,580
great anyone else okay so I mean I do

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,169
have their problems but I would argue

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,340
that most successful products in the

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,650
mark of the day at some point probably

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,060
started as a monolith and he recommended

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,800
live down into its core pieces they have

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,600
some very interesting characteristics

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,899
so all the code lives in one deployable

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,339
system that's pretty neat and offers

00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:58,959
lots of really interesting things when

00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:00,699
you look at it each commit or each

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,110
change as an atomic action across your

00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:04,209
entire code base so you make one change

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,480
you push it and you've therefore change

00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,440
your entire stack so that's pretty neat

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,630
debug ability becomes really simple

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,709
because one a or one stack trace it's

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,209
all in one place you don't have to go

00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,519
across everywhere it's a piece together

00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:17,050
the world versioning and while all these

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,399
things become quite simple because you

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,660
don't really version because you're the

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,069
only client for the thing you've built

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,750
so again you just avoid it and it works

00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:24,790
you know fingers crossed

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,399
basically information is easy to find

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,110
when it's collocated or all together so

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,339
everything everything is in one place

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,019
and it becomes really easy to be

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:33,250
familiar around like maybe not with all

00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,899
the intricacies especially as it grows

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,579
but you have a good idea of like we're

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,110
in this monolith certain functionality

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:40,569
behavior will live so you can just go

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,800
look in that area on the other hand

00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:44,649
though distributed systems are extremely

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:48,160
hard and that's how you know it's hard

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,360
so so you're like good and they're only

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,029
as good as the internet and between them

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,680
and that never goes bad data is forced

00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,180
across multiple different databases and

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,410
it becomes a you know very challenge to

00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,689
piece together bit by bit of all this

00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,860
information the shooter Rob a single

00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:02,230
source of truth of what an entity really

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,939
means managing versus become managing

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,230
releases and versioning is very

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:09,610
challenging across multiple different

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,959
api's and systems become very complex so

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,819
race conditions of sugar transactions

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,740
davinci consistency are some of the fun

00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:16,449
buzzwords I was able to Google so

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,579
information is hard to find when it's

00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,560
spread out so while the slope has lots

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,089
of good benefits everything is isolated

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,660
and separate and I think that makes it a

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:27,699
much more complex this soon so if more

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,620
or less of super gray and shimmery

00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:32,350
systems were super hard why do we offer

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,029
the harder of the two almost always as I

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,529
mentioned I would wager that almost all

00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:38,079
successful products in the market at one

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:40,899
point probably were a monolith but one

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,550
of us break down so they can't scale but

00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:43,899
what does that mean well from my point

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,279
of view I think a computer doesn't

00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,079
really mind if it's on one computer or

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,810
on three hundred Peters running your

00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,660
code it just wants to do its job so how

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,819
do they break down I don't really think

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,019
it's a computer thing so I believe it

00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:58,920
isn't the coding problem at all

00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:01,389
I believe it's entirely a people problem

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,440
because communication is inherently

00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:04,629
complex

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,779
it's inherently bossy and it breaks on

00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:09,069
that scale so I think communication at

00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:10,810
the fruits is a very interesting topic

00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:12,879
so I have an original thought in my mind

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,319
and the only advice I have is my words

00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,389
to communicate that thought into your

00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:18,040
mind and everyone has different

00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,660
background and experiences and like my

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,519
phrasing or my terminology might impact

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,230
your adults versus my thoughts you know

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,579
an entirely different way so we spend 1

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,990
to 1 this is a very challenging thing to

00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:27,850
begin with let alone when you're trying

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,860
to communicate to tune 10 people or 10

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,449
we keep 50 people open on your team so

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,459
computers will do it every way tell them

00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:36,189
to with code however people aren't

00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,870
always so easy so there's great talk by

00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:39,670
rich icky called simple made easy and

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,589
where he covers the main differences

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,540
between simple and complex easy and hard

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,920
and if you haven't watched it please go

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,420
watch it it's much better than this one

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,660
but um anyway I'll try to summarize it

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,910
briefly so simple at its roots is

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,649
composed of a single element so I have a

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,360
hope we all understand simple but you

00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,800
look at this rope oh you know where it

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,889
starts and II know what's going the

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,149
simple rope it's it's one thing so too

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,589
complex something or the next on the

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,230
complex is kind of the opposite of this

00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,370
it's to interweave or braid together so

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,870
if you look at this example of ropes

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,910
it's very hard to determine where one

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,139
rope starts one row of ends other kind

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,060
of braid to really tightly together and

00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:16,269
to remove them to go back to one simple

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,350
rope would be very hard so let's see how

00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,990
this comes into play when we're talking

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,250
about our teams or a monolith so in this

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,630
example we'll imagine all the circles

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,689
are people and the lines are how we

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,100
communicate with each other so if you

00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:28,569
have team of three there's three lines

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,430
of communication these lines aren't

00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:32,800
grated or crossed this communication is

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,120
very simple generally with the team of

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,860
three this is what I'll get to tell the

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,569
dream team it's very simple to have

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,949
community communication like impromptu

00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:40,329
meetings at your desk it's probably a

00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:41,920
little very little process in your

00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:43,899
workflow and you're able to move very

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,899
quickly and the cost of communication is

00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:48,339
very low because it's very simple so

00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,500
naturally as this team grows at just six

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,509
the lines you know it three more people

00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,529
the last I've gone from 3 to 15 and as

00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:55,000
you can see they are abraded

00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,980
so it is much more complex of an

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,750
environment so generally teams will have

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,639
meetings meant product memos you know

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,199
daily stand-ups and all these things

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,730
ticketing issues things like that and as

00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,350
you can see as we go to just twelve it's

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,879
nearly impossible to work in this

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,459
fashion there were naturally will be

00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,230
silos that develop so there's no way a

00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,950
team of twelve or fifteen or thirty more

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,320
people can work in

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,870
away in this manner so the cost

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,340
communication is way too high it's it's

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,870
almost impossible to everyone to be

00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,450
aligned moving in the same direction and

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,400
not too fast it's very impossible

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,930
so probably the no surprise of view we

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,730
break these into smaller Tunes or

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,250
smaller groups and generally these break

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,570
up into smaller microservices this

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,730
allows them to go back to the dream team

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:37,000
same tool people four teams three lines

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,830
no complexity so with microservices

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,720
we've optimized very well for

00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,160
independent teams each team can go back

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,900
to their dream team opposed to three to

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,180
five people moving very quickly knowing

00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,610
what everyone else is working on and

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:50,670
communication is very simple so this is

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:55,060
power single teams to move very quickly

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:56,110
and I think that has lots of power but

00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,000
what happens when these teams need to

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,190
work together data requirements very

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,450
rarely live within just one system now

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,490
we need to push and pull data between

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,430
these systems and how do we do that

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,560
today most commonly oh well we use rest

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,090
and I'm not here to bash stress I think

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,200
rest has gone this a very long way and I

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,060
have still has lots of very good use

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,430
cases and particularly foul-up those are

00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,590
hard however I do think that rest has

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,330
fell down sometimes the main issue I

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,650
have with rest however is that I think

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,650
it's it makes it easy to make mistakes

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,560
so let's go through so a couple of war

00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:29,110
stories so if you have a resource called

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,170
person is the plural of this person's

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,520
slash one or is it people slash one sure

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm sure the spec talks about what to do

00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,130
here proper but would you know the top

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,470
of your head or with one of your

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,540
co-workers what about another use case

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,370
we were like I need to make a breaking

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,920
ABI change to one of my ten resources

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,080
sure awesome ride some new codes lab the

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,380
API v2 on it BAM you're done

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,300
alright well what do you two do like do

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,070
you tell all your clients hey you need

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,870
to use v2 just for this one resource and

00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,070
be one for the rest already promote all

00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,440
of them now to be too even though only

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,180
one resource has changed again I'm sure

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,290
the spec covers what to do but I seen

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,990
this done very differently at every

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,240
company I've ever worked at so each

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,890
client each new resource has to be

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,750
curated manually with all the students

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,880
--is a client needs to know which tile

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,590
which service houses which data which

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,450
api needs which authentication or

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,880
authorization and which teams can even

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,840
add new attributes to be used so Rebecca

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,540
the same place we were with this

00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,690
monolithic team except worse we're doing

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,490
it over the internet with a smash

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,310
network we're over a large amount of

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,350
teams with their own competing backlogs

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:32,390
so API versioning req new changes data

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,690
migrations we are in a very complex

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,520
system so graphic old was a sip for the

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,080
Beyonder s in my opinion I think it

00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,580
helps an entire organization of teams

00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,120
communicate and I'm much more efficient

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,410
way it changed the paradigm of how we

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,120
build systems and interact with other

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,550
people and that's where the power I

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,110
think of Gref 12 surely lies instead of

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,610
backends dictating which data and in

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,730
which shape is exposed to which clients

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,800
Nix Ansari it instead just Express what

00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,030
is possible to access the clients have

00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,840
the power that they can pull data out

00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,300
however they see fit

00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,100
it is the schema and is the API contract

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,350
between all teams it is a source of

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,230
truth and it is ever-evolving agreement

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,790
between everyone of what is possible so

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,470
con the days of throwing over the coat

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,970
over the wall hoping for the best

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,290
instead ref chill promotes a more

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,850
uniform working experience between front

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,620
and end back and engineers but I would

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,750
argue that even goes beyond that I can

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,910
help drive the main driven terminology

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:26,090
between product design engineers and

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,320
potentially your users all like so no

00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,820
more back-end saying here's the data

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,320
you're going to get and no more weird

00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,270
front-end requests that you know a bit

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,290
wonky they don't make much sense instead

00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,880
all these argument are just gone

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,620
I would say both teams or all teams

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,590
should be involved in developing the

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,880
schema it's a contract between everyone

00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,440
within the organization this is the data

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,450
that it's possible to access yet the

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,430
parodies are however you want I think

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,500
that schemas are a superset of all use

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,000
cases so sure you want to add a new use

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,630
case you can probably use the existing

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,460
schema to do so so instead of exposing

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,560
database those database tables over

00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,080
api's I think we should instead reflect

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,430
the products needs so we can truly think

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,800
what is what would best serve our users

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,170
and boss for most holistically reflect

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,730
our business domain and expose that

00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,709
through the schema and then the clients

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,939
can pull and pull this edit to build

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,680
whatever is possible to make a quality

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,270
product I'm behind the scenes bingo

00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,250
fetch and saw this ad however we see fit

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,050
to be the most performant or whatever we

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,589
need it becomes your public interface

00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,720
for your entire company so how many of

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,709
you have ever been in a meeting where

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,390
everyone says slightly different words

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,740
to mean the same thing and then you have

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,559
to go back to your editor to try

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,120
yet again into something else you know

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,410
to make it work and I tuned this

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,170
whatever company as well and I think

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,540
that's I was a really sad thing but with

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,559
this product locus schema in mind it'll

00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,179
to have so many benefits within the

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,920
organization whether you use craft you

00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:44,120
or not honestly but I think graphic will

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,920
help remotes are speaking the same

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,960
language all working towards the same

00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,940
shared schema front-end engineers back

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,470
an engineer's product design users can

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,929
all be aligned on what the terminology

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,040
is and what it means it can help drive

00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:57,380
this ubiquitous language for

00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,030
organization everyone talked about the

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,450
same thing meaning the same thing that

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,950
has real power so when you have this

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,600
product locus schema and everything is

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,559
aligned with terminology this will

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,850
enable teams to move pretty quickly

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,710
because they'll have a good idea of you

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,179
know what's going on but things

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,850
naturally change and how do we handle

00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:15,830
that well versioning unlike rest becomes

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,970
much less of this dance of like you're

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,040
changing and I'm changing and you gotta

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,679
deploy first and I'm after you whatever

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,880
so like and said all the teams should

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,320
work together to figure out what should

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,400
I change the schema actually mean and

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,260
how do we reflect that and the most

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,750
possible like the best possible way so

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,460
you know add some new fields to ever get

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,260
some old ones semantics of an old field

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,840
of change that's a bummer

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,640
at a new fields every kid the old one

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,590
this kind of there's great tools like a

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,600
polo engine that will help you drive

00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,190
actual quantifiable metrics around like

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,600
which clients are using which fields and

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,520
if you're lucky enough you can go and

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,900
force it or just encourage them like we

00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,330
do at Netflix that they should migrate

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,800
through this new field and this overtime

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,540
will allow you to remove things that are

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,800
no longer being used and this kind of

00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,179
allows for rolling forward development

00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,140
cycle instead of like let's halt the

00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:58,460
roll to make sure we orchestrate

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,160
deployments and so you're just like

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,050
continue to move forward one of the

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,820
biggest fears I often hear and I felt

00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,830
myself was when you start looking at

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,960
adopting graph chill the fear of you

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,030
have to change the world well you've

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,190
already built your castle you all have

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,110
your infrastructure and your Marcus is

00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,610
some of that has to change instead you

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,809
can just leverage existing platforms and

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,700
tools and interests enhancer which

00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:21,830
crafty well you don't have to rewrite

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,690
the world so what this means for your

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,550
teams is pretty interesting and I in my

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,600
opinion pretty empowering so beckon

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,340
engineers don't necessarily have to

00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,750
change their entire workflow they could

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,490
keep optimizing but things are they

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,860
enjoy doing but front-end engineers can

00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,480
leverage this new platform to access the

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,580
data in a much more simple way I'm sure

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,409
most of you aware you have an old your

00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,270
PC service you don't want to know

00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:43,190
awesome don't do it you have an old soap

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,990
API that no one can use or work on any

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,149
more awesome treated as a black box and

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,250
wrap some calls to it the team's been

00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:50,750
sued Optimas like what they're best at

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,279
whether that's Hayase LA's or

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,570
performance or building the best you

00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,279
extra our users

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:58,159
let them do with their best set and just

00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,779
enhance that experience with graph QL so

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,070
you declare your product focus schema

00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:02,840
things really quickly you're able to

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,460
change your requirements but what

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,980
happens if you live in a world we had a

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,570
few of these entities well you can merge

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,010
these entities into small API gateway

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,990
and some teams have gone as far enough

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,490
is automating this entire flow that will

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,899
proxy all the requests to the correct

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,370
downstream service and I'm really

00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:18,770
excited to hear about other things that

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,630
a public platform may enable in a more

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,130
efficient way to do this so I'm really

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,559
interested to see what what comes out of

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:27,080
that let's see an example and my one

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,360
diagram for this entire presentation so

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,770
I always want the word stitching very

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,080
hard to say in Sibel as you can tell

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,669
from my diagram so I like to call it

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,220
SEMA folding because that's way more

00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:38,809
easy to say so with this model you can

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,159
have your dream teams like I mentioned

00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:41,390
before each team being three to five

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,520
people moving quickly working on their

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:46,220
product domain you know in this example

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,200
we have users products payments and

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,730
reporting whatever so the communication

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,750
within these students can remain simple

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,220
they can move quickly they can iterate

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,260
on their product focus to do whatever

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,789
they need to do and then when tools like

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,169
Apollo you can leverage them together

00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:00,080
merge them together stitch them together

00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:01,909
into a single API gateway where you can

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,649
explore and understand your schema in a

00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:05,210
whole new way so you take me

00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:07,940
strongly-typed schemas merge them

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,590
together to build a single API so if you

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,320
can achieve this you'll have a single

00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,929
API a single graph a single monolithic

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,730
API that will allow teams to develop

00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:17,779
very rapidly all teams will have a

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,950
common language to describe the

00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,960
interactions and behavior of the

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,010
entities within their whole system so

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,990
let's build understand big monolith

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,789
let's build let's develop a single place

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:29,270
to explore and discover what it's

00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:31,340
possible of our system this will enable

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:35,659
mini teams to move very quickly

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,610
I believe graph corel promotes a new

00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:39,470
type of service a higher order service

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,820
if you will I think of it as like a

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,179
giant map function in the cloud

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:46,039
countless clients can be it can explore

00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,080
and a build against the safety are in a

00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:49,820
whole new way instead of having to write

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,440
bespoke new recen points they can just

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,770
use the graph and most likely that it

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,140
will

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,430
fill their needs as I mentioned earlier

00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,850
my team over the last year has been

00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,740
building a single entity graph so having

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,780
us press rap has changed the way that we

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,760
worked it as well allowed us to optimize

00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,160
therefore break exploration of this data

00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,510
we can dig into the complexities of how

00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,040
this data should be expressed across

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,680
multiple different contexts of people

00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,050
using this data and allows the way to

00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,680
change the way that we build features as

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:20,180
we saw yesterday in the live demo I want

00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,740
someone that types coach and it's

00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,300
amazing but you can see that it really

00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,710
just changes how we build features and a

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,660
whole new way they were able to build

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,970
basically Airbnb in like 30 minutes

00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,500
that's pretty cool I'll tell you that so

00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,720
it opens her eyes to a new way of

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,340
answering questions we can visualize

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,960
this data that historically has been

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,300
sparse and spread around many different

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,220
subsystems as one unified data model and

00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,240
that really changed the way I think we

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,950
think about building things

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,220
the thing is though this was just the

00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:47,090
start as we've been exposed to the new

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,130
way of thinking and answering these

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,080
questions we really think that the prize

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,180
of graph drill it's quite bigger than

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,580
you think sure having a single entity

00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,080
graph provides tons of value but I think

00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,250
the real value lives when you can expand

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,290
this principle to have your other team

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,520
it will unlock a whole new world of

00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,950
thinking about these types of problems

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,640
because in reality as soon as you have

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:09,680
one entity you need them all really did

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,230
something live in isolation and one

00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,410
entity will you know just you know need

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,940
relations for the entities and this data

00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,170
in a system is going to change over time

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,720
so more and more nodes will need to

00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,980
connect with each other so like I

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,150
mentioned earlier we've been showing off

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,920
our graph saying when you graph two

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,330
other teams and they want on board they

00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,650
think this is super interesting they

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,740
want to expose their enteral and

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,760
engineers and they want to leverage ours

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,800
seems are happy to talk about what the

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,110
schema should be and evolve the the

00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,160
meanings of these names and it helps us

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,130
interact with each other in a much more

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,200
efficient way so it is spreading and it

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,480
seems like every new public weeks a new

00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,840
talent entering a new graph is spawning

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,820
up so really excited to work on this so

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,190
over the next year we're working to

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,660
build a multi entity graph just to get a

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,340
view into the holistic information that

00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,710
we have within our org to explore these

00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,660
questions so we've tried this initiative

00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,109
and I'm super excited to see what will

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,340
come out

00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:03,479
both for graph Giro and for Netflix

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,009
hopefully we can work really closely

00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:06,419
with Apollo and the wider community to

00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:09,840
potentially make some open-source tools

00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,950
that we can all benefit from so we will

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,570
be able to answer questions the business

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,159
says now but I think if we didn't get to

00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,809
this model at the KPI and that describes

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,309
our entire entities and they behavior

00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:18,299
between them we'll be able to answer

00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:20,159
questions we don't even know to ask

00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:21,840
instead of having to retrofit new

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,159
features in or when the business wants

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,479
more information we'll just be able to

00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,889
say oh cool we have this graph let's go

00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:29,759
explore it and we'll find the answers

00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:31,469
that you need a new way to visualize

00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,440
this information is going to directly

00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:37,279
change how we build systems but that

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,849
Netflix can may go a bit further

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,649
whatever you could stop building

00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:41,809
applications altogether like what would

00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:45,269
that mean and what would that look like

00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:47,759
so our team is trying to find that out

00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:49,320
so we've recently created an Innovation

00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,839
Lab to explore experiment what these

00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,609
what these ideas might be so can we

00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,259
leverage these strongly-typed api's and

00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:56,909
not only expose the data from them but

00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:58,229
potentially generate entire UI is based

00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,450
on them based on some UI primitives

00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:01,919
maybe with some configuration and a

00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,179
couple of whiz-bang features and bam

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,989
you've you've launched a brand new app

00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,999
what would that be

00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:07,019
I'd be pretty mean what if we would have

00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:08,099
figured build things ahead of time that

00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:09,839
business don't even know they need or

00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:12,089
haven't asked for yet I think having

00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,109
this graph of a facilitate pulling

00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:15,509
together multiple different data sources

00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:17,009
in a very interesting way and how can we

00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:18,899
leverage and build a system that not

00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:20,820
only impacts and benefits our team but

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:23,339
potentially benefits the entire org in a

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,869
very very very efficient way so we were

00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:27,659
starting us endeavor I'm really excited

00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:29,129
to see what I come out of it so crazy

00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,779
ideas on what it can mean to build these

00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,950
kind of apps or you want to change the

00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,809
way that content is produced and

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,609
consumed to impact our users or the

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:36,839
happiness of our viewers please come

00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,499
speak with me after this I would love to

00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,509
chat with you

00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:42,109
and I'll leave you with one final

00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:43,919
thought I think graph girl is amazing

00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:45,389
not necessarily because of all the

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,619
technology or the tools well I think

00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:47,789
those although all of those are very

00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:48,419
powerful when they're very big driving

00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:50,489
forces

00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,619
I think Raph girl wins my heart because

00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:54,119
it changes human behavior it really

00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:55,950
starts teams talking together to work

00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,659
together to evolve this single schema

00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,639
there are a type of living source of

00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:01,559
truth of what the API text text anonyme

00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:03,719
really is within your ecosystem and it's

00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,830
an explorable viewable navigatable thing

00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:06,809
to understand how all of your systems

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,820
