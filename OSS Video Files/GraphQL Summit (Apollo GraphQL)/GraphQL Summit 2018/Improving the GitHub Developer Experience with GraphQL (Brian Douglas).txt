Title: Improving the GitHub Developer Experience with GraphQL (Brian Douglas)
Publication date: 2018-12-05
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2018
Description: 
	Talk from GraphQL Summit 2018 - Nov 8, 2018

Brian Douglas is a Developer Advocate at GitHub where he works on increasing use of the GitHub API by helping users through technical content and examples. He focuses his day to day work on developer engagement through the GiHub Developer Program by fostering a community for 3rd party API development. The move to GraphQL marked a larger shift in GitHub's Platform strategy towards more transparency and more flexibility in our API. Over the past year, GitHub has been iterating on their schema to bring it closer towards feature completeness and strengthening the use for 3rd party integrators. Join me in walking through some of the newer ways developers are leveraging our API primitives and benefiting from GraphQL adoption into their development workflow.

all right so I'm here to talk about

00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,440
github Dow developer experience with the

00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,059
graphical API so how many were you were

00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,340
in the talk yesterday by mark Andre

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,710
Giroux all right so he talked about how

00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,000
building it I was gonna talk a little

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,830
about that but he'd covered a lot of

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,870
that so this could be more of users

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,250
using to get a graphical API didn't

00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,260
proved their deadline for experience so

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,690
just for context in case people want to

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,090
go see the talk upstairs I also realized

00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,920
so I was the talk my talk was accepted a

00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,930
while ago I had an abstract and I had

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,300
this whole plan and I I created the

00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,949
title of like with that plan but if I

00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,660
were to resubmit this talk today I just

00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:43,940
called this sampling graph QL I think

00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,589
that's like the best context of what I'm

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,350
gonna be talking about and I think it'll

00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:49,489
be clear once I get through this but if

00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,059
you guys don't mind bear with me I'm

00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:55,219
gonna share a bit of a story telling any

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:56,989
Netflix engineers here they've been

00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,769
working Netflix alright cool so I love

00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:02,179
this show and it got cancelled so I'm

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,979
not upset I'm just gonna mention that

00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:05,089
but this is an awesome show so a couple

00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:07,190
years ago this came out in like in

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:09,229
summer and the show who's ever seen the

00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,460
show to get down you can still watch it

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:13,579
tonight they didn't delete it

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,259
RM dash RF to get down thank you for

00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,909
that at least but yeah so this shows

00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:19,159
about the Bronx kids in the Bronx they

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:22,130
were building their first hip hop crew

00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,079
so hip hop at the time it came right

00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,340
after disco so in the Bronx it was going

00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,770
through like a lot of fires a lot of

00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,649
problems bad infrastructure poor mayor

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:33,140
and leadership as far as New York goes

00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:34,909
and so this was like that story telling

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,829
of that summer where hip hop was sort of

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,450
this kind of blew up and these high

00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:40,789
school kids saw this and they want to be

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,039
build their own hip hop crew which is

00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:44,799
great and what I learned is that since

00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,119
it was coming after the backs of disco

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,859
all the hip hop beats that were coming

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,530
out were actually built on top of disco

00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:54,020
so that's sort of the stage OB settings

00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,090
and because of that and what I wanted to

00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,159
call this talk sampling graph QL is

00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,729
because it's nothing but sampled disc

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,229
disco tracks and to prove that there's

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,359
this group that looks like there's some

00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,369
disco crew literally out of like you

00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,899
know studio 54 they're actually a

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,240
hip-hop crew it's a Grandmaster Flash

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,879
and the Furious Five you guys anybody

00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,599
heard these guys maybe not maybe yes

00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,530
they did a lot of cool stuff one song

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,630
that I

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,580
really like touch my heart as like a

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,350
young high school kid learning about the

00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,520
old hip hop of the day because this is

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,980
like way after my time was called this

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,300
song was called a message you probably

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,560
haven't heard it but just bear with me

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,120
I'm just gonna sing a little line of it

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,740
it's like my brother's doing fast at my

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,900
mother's TV says he's watching too much

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,970
it's is not healthy so anyway that's it

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,580
you probably have heard that one but the

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,150
hook of it is actually don't push me

00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:46,459
cause I'm close to the edge yeah you

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,590
guys know the rest yeah so that's a song

00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,570
and this song was actually just the

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,150
transition from everything being about

00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,010
hotel motel holiday inn to being social

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,230
commentary what was going on in the

00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,820
inner cities and this was this was great

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,040
because then we got gangster rap

00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,959
directly right after that so late 80s we

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,610
got gangster rap and you guys are

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,080
familiar of gangster rap like it is

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,310
social commentary it's just a little

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,690
more forceful and if you don't know like

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,569
we did that like straight up compton it

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,790
was a movie that came out so NWA it was

00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,980
portrayed Public Enemy as well with Ice

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,610
Cube and Flavor Flav who were now like

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:26,030
amazing reality TV stars and NCIS and

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,709
then obviously dr. Dre who built my USBC

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:31,459
connector I don't think he really did

00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,500
but so from gangsta rap then we had

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,799
early 90s gangster reps and we had Tupac

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,110
as well and the cool thing about Tupac

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,390
Tupac is born in Brooklyn but raised

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,890
here in Oakland so he had a song called

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,329
ain't nothing but a sorry I was actually

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,670
called to America's Most Wanted he did

00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:48,410
it with Snoop Dogg and which is funny

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,079
because one of the conference's I went

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,630
to that I spoke at actually here

00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,730
upstairs in the lodge there was a day

00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,430
after Snoop Dogg performed here and like

00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,109
the entire venue sort of smelled like

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,579
plant-based material it was interesting

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,769
I'm not sure of what they were doing in

00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:07,310
here the night before but it must been a

00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,660
crazy party so this song which the hook

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,120
for that song is called ate nothing but

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,650
a gangster's party I said you guys

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,859
familiar am I just like embarrassing

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,410
myself okay so that song was sampled

00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:21,109
from the message from Grandmaster Flash

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,340
so the actual hook it's hard to hear but

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:23,990
the hook of that song

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,880
the beat is actually sampled from that

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,169
song so I about all this because in 1996

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,870
one thing happened to Pok actually was

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,280
unfortunately killed and shot and then

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,830
that was the year gangster rap sort of

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,960
died kind of died with them is long with

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,520
a couple other people got shot but it's

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,710
also in the same year that we got rest

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,389
so house a lot of slides that get at

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,270
this point so Roy fielding did the

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,220
architecture of rest and submit us to

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,990
the college after go to analyze but yeah

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,050
we got rest this year and we kind of got

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,220
it in production in 2000 so I do I went

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,600
through all that because I work at this

00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,840
company called github bring have you

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,800
guys uh heard of it no a couple of ok

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,240
I'll explain it

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,680
we're small incubator inside of

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,350
Microsoft where we're hanging on

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,600
developer tooling where can I developer

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,850
tooling which is awesome because I'm a

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,500
developer advocate I get up so my

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,540
day-to-day this is what I look like on

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,400
the internet it's also all my handles

00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,110
and stuff like that so you can if you

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,760
are you curious of like Who I am and all

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,160
that it's sort of like bio stuff and my

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,979
dog picture is like check out that my

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,539
Twitter but as an advocate github like

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,950
we have a lot of advocates like I had a

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:28,900
co-worker who does nothing but shift

00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,520
graph QL schema stuff and API stuff and

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,320
he's advocating github by just being

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,389
here on stage my full time is being

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,400
advocate which is slight slightly

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:39,280
different because my full time job is to

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,160
be queen bee I'm sorry the Queen Bey of

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,010
github and this is like this sounds

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,139
really like conceited for me to say but

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,599
it's what I really mean by being queen

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,030
bee of github is that every single day I

00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,979
get to ask what would they do

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,110
so like github 31 million developers

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,340
worldwide so we have a lot of people

00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,840
using our platform and we have a lot of

00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,919
people of different use cases and the

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,539
cool thing about my job is I get to

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,070
listen to those and I could kind of like

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,900
I could be a solvent myself which is

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,010
really hard problems I don't think it'd

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,479
solve it but then I can also pitch it to

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,220
other people I can build an open-source

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:10,510
projects help support that effort so I

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,950
can't do it all but all the stuff that

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,740
you do in your free time I get to do in

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,240
my full time which is awesome and sort

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,220
of sum that up I go to bat for the hive

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
so if you do have issues definitely you

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,669
hit me up on Twitter I've been given

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,830
people actions access we like ship

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:26,349
actions I could do that as well

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,470
this one at a time please so my focus

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,729
really is around the API so I'm gonna

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,680
talk about the graphical API we've had

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,810
the public for two years even before

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,630
graph kilo came out of Developer Preview

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,810
we've been using graph fuel publicly on

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,729
our API which I'll get into in a moment

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,280
but the cool thing about this is that

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:47,980
github really shows

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,740
the graph QL spec to help ride

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,910
flexibility the integrators so a lot of

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,970
people don't know this but get-ups ten

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,410
years old and the API itself is ten

00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,030
years old so we've been shipping an API

00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,370
as long as we've been shipping code to

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,820
support entire developer ecosystem and

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,230
pull requests and etc and these two

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,480
points really it's all about integrators

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,610
so anybody who builds on top of the

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,860
eight our API so it's like circle it's

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,020
Travis this is Microsoft this is Google

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,540
everybody who's using our platform to

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,830
ship code or our integrators and we look

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,480
at integrators slightly different

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,310
because you're building the future and

00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,900
our future features and supporting our

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,730
future features and that's what I really

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,040
want to support and what I'm here to

00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,800
really talk about and then provide that

00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,260
flexibility so we're all about building

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,570
something or providing some endpoints or

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,310
now queries and then getting out of way

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,820
so if you're not if you don't have what

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,860
you need

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,260
we have you but we have tools for you to

00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,960
come look for us and ask questions and

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,970
like make a big storm on Twitter as well

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,500
this is the picture of our github

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,260
universe a couple year couple weeks ago

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,540
not years but weeks on the other side of

00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,300
mixin especially the power some kind of

00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,370
hearts but we want github actions for

00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,630
this actual purpose it's actually our

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,280
biggest feature should simpler request

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,320
and the core quest is 10 years old as

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,150
well so like as far as changing the way

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,000
people interact with git and interact

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,130
with their teams across the world

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,270
actions this is really huge and that's

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,050
all I'll say about actions this know

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,970
that it's a thing you should probably

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,320
look it up but again I just want to

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,789
reiterate like we're we're in the

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,110
business of building developed with

00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:18,669
tooling and then moving out of the way

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,860
so the developers can push their code so

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:22,600
a lot of us or push and get like

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,800
including myself like sometimes I've

00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,229
ever been logging to github for like

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,160
weeks because I'm just like working on

00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:28,570
something and I just want to make sure

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,220
it's saved up and github and that my

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,570
team can see it and then I open up ER at

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,140
the end of a sprint or whatever I should

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,870
so yeah the day we're trying to build

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,400
better hooks into our API better reasons

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,560
for you to use it better reasons for you

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,050
to build on our platform and I don't

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,360
know who better to talk about hooks than

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,220
Puff Daddy you guys might know him as P

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,950
Diddy that's his new name he was like

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,990
reborn or something but Puff Daddy

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,209
he'd built a song shark he'd create a

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,610
song he didn't really build it but he

00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:59,240
created a song which is called like I'll

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,000
be missing you and it was

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,730
right after the same year in 1996 big

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,920
notorious b.i.g got shot and killed as

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,540
well and that was what a puppy's really

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,880
close friends he was on the bad puffiest

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,100
the producer for bad boy and Biggie

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,440
Smalls was on bad boy so what I'm

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,959
getting at is that Puff Daddy build a

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,339
hook on top of an old song so like this

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,980
is like a pattern that we've been doing

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,420
years after years like we took like rock

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,490
music came from other things blues music

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,160
came from of things like rap hip hop any

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,779
sort of like techno you know trance I

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,139
don't know what did kids listen in these

00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,720
days

00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:34,910
I don't know I'm too old I'm way old I

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,740
look really good for my age too

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,260
but what I'm getting at is that in 1997

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,389
just one year later the entire hip hop

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,070
industry changed based on all these

00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:45,529
sampling of this new age of sampling

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,240
beats and no longer looking at disco but

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:50,089
looking at what came before and sampling

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,680
that and it was like a whole time when I

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,810
was in middle school that every single

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,209
hip-hop artist would make the same video

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,610
with the fisheye lens and like had the

00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:00,800
same sort of beats from like Jermaine

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,300
Dupri and etc at that and we're the same

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,630
clothes and had the patent leather suits

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:08,480
were like super popular in the 70s and

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:11,269
came back as like weirdness and the

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,620
early 2000s in late 90s but I think the

00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:14,209
best part about this age and hip hop

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,339
which I'll move the code in a sec but

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:18,560
I'd want to mention that even Will Smith

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:19,910
came back to get jiggy with it so like

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,089
this is when he came back and became

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:26,449
like finished Fresh Prince and became

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:28,250
the second Age reborn rapper so I bring

00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:30,230
all this up to be the correlation -

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,760
sorry if you guys are like hip-hop

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,380
culture I don't know this is too much

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,920
it's like 20 slides Linden he hasn't

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:40,220
even showed me code so in 2016 github

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,720
decided to sample graph QL the spec came

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,399
out like I think about react comped I

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,839
forget when it actually was officially

00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,970
launched our warrant was launched I was

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,639
gonna react and actually be honest and

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,930
they decided to build a prototype and

00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,430
graph you all because they are having a

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,680
lot of problems like we have 31 million

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,510
developers at the time was less that are

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,790
using our platform and we had problems

00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,709
like rate limiting and like constantly

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,410
having this stuff fall over from like

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:05,959
over usage and we decided this sample

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,970
graph QL and we sampled it enough time

00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,780
so finally we decided to try it out for

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,080
real

00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,640
and at that time I actually I do a

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,010
podcast about Jam sack radio and I had

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,200
opportunity to interview the now senior

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,360
director of ecosystem who pushed efforts

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,410
for grass gol his name's Kyle bagel so

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,700
check out this podcast if you want to

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,400
hear more about that story I'll just

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,770
move on from that but Jam sec radio it's

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,460
on Twitter somewhere so the very next

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:34,070
year in 2017 github so it's like a

00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,950
correlation github launched their public

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,360
first graph kill first API so a lot of

00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,130
people that I actually was up I'm the

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,330
guide it was upstate upstairs standing

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,160
actually to github table so if you were

00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:46,130
walking back to the lodge I was this way

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,330
to get you and like take a sticker but a

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,890
lot of people didn't realize like github

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,440
is actually a ruby on rails app it's

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,450
like it started as a giant mono lift

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,430
I think server SurveyMonkey had like

00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,250
very similar problems that we just heard

00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,990
about the last talk and we went graph

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,150
cool first which like a big shift away

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,920
from the traditional ruby on rails app

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,150
but we decided to do it because we

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,260
needed to solve a new problem like we

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,400
were solving these problems in other

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,290
technologies trying to create our own

00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,130
technologies so then we decided to go

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,330
ahead and give graphical a try and

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,500
talking about hooks like one of the

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,150
problems we had with rest is that what

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,100
there was inconsistency in the RIC in

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,020
the API so we had a ten-year-old API at

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,250
the time eight years and every time we

00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,680
had a new version like we had breaking

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,370
changes so we had to make a new version

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,150
endpoints would change issues and then

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,830
repositories would have different like

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,150
timestamps that were formatted

00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,010
completely different so there's like no

00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,660
consistency across the board and that's

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,360
mainly because I github is a fast like

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,790
growing company strappy startup today

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,620
we're 950 people today but most of that

00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,050
actually come in the last year a third

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,620
that's come in the last year so we were

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,840
significantly smaller than most

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,150
companies that we would think and that

00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,680
inconsistent came like between different

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,820
problems we have solved and those years

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,100
we solved them and the different

00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,620
technologies being available the other

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,140
thing that I sort of got first hand up

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,640
it's like documentation like github is

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,900
nothing but reference Docs devote

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,520
productive a commis is a lot of

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,230
reference Docs and if you know what

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,040
you're looking for you can find it but

00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,480
if you don't know what you're looking

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,720
for you can't you're never gonna find it

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,810
and all my developing as as far as like

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,300
being a sort of like a startup e SF

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,100
developer came from another engineer who

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,750
knew more than me would just tell me

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,279
what to look for and that's how I would

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,259
get to the documentation

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,459
and that doesn't really scale especially

00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,560
so if we're having so many new

00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,660
developers come from college boot camps

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,060
and supporting all these new new roles

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,279
the cool thing is that at the time of

00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,629
the public graph QL API being launched

00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,360
we launched this thing called graph fuel

00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:40,040
Explorer it really wasn't anything new

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,959
if you've done if you touched graph QL a

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,209
couple years ago we had graphical it's

00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,800
still around it's electron tap and you

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:49,100
could sort of interact with your

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,870
graphical API through this and directly

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,180
get a developer Docs you can now run

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,399
queries on your actual github data so

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,870
you can sample github data today and

00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,519
developer to get up a comment so I

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,920
should be for Explorer so that's the URL

00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,079
but you can easily Google that so the

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,910
biggest thing is like I think actually

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:06,800
boot highway the individuals who did the

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,410
the teaching early this week like they

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,290
leverage github and the developer

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,819
Explorer and their actual material so

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,350
you can actually train people how do you

00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,999
graph go but I think without ever

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,309
spinning up a server because it's a good

00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:21,079
chance that a lot of us in the room do

00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:23,569
have a github account at least signed up

00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,519
once and then of the cool thing is like

00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:27,230
the data is right there so I can test

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,879
out my queries see what data I'm looking

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,290
for and then go ahead and just copy and

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,149
paste that query in the drove right into

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,009
my IDE or a BS code or whatever you're

00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:35,569
using to that the other cool thing is

00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:38,120
that it solved the documentation problem

00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:39,319
for me so I was able to discover what

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,930
sort of endpoints what's her data was

00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:44,180
actually being a to receive for this

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,860
graphical API and I'm having a time in

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,329
2017 when they went public with the API

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,309
was intact so I've been at github since

00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:51,410
February so my entire interactions with

00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,120
graphical API has been a consumer so

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,699
that's why my talks really focus for

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,279
consuming the API so at that time in

00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:59,990
2017 I got really excited about Brock ul

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,689
I went to I bet this is my third summit

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,579
and I wanted to really try it out and

00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:05,899
because github had like the most

00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,319
prominent public API

00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,759
I had graph tool at my fingertips so I

00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:13,490
had the idea of actually this building a

00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,439
project and at the time I would always

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,420
like contribute to open source but I'd

00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:19,220
never like follow through so and then I

00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,319
would read hacker news or read some

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,899
newsletter and find a project that I

00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:25,790
think I could probably contribute to but

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:28,100
then it'd be like two weekends later and

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,569
I'd forget what that project was so I

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,279
wanted to build a like a tool on top of

00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:32,329
github to get get into open source I

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,040
know there's a lot of them out there but

00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:35,110
I wanted to scratch two itches like open

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,680
source as well as

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,730
the graph QL and that's what I did and

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,110
as I mentioned I want to get involved in

00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,130
open source but every time I find a

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,370
project I didn't know buddy good start

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,570
which thing comes to Gucci Mane so this

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,089
is all hip-hop it's gonna keep going

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,589
guys so gucci mane he's the Godfather at

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,269
rap music he's the reason why we have

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:55,360
mumble rap so if you're not really into

00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:58,480
Lego that's good she made so he's from

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,430
Atlanta he's also a prominent sampler if

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,320
you guys ever watch South Park there's a

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,810
song called like love and you it's easy

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,680
cause you're beautiful

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,140
that's the only reason I know that song

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,959
he sampled that and made a trap song so

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,180
it's it's pretty awful but trying to

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,680
feel like but I get I talk about good

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,000
Chi man because he had this one

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,740
interview on YouTube there's actually a

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,180
tumblr originally but now it's on

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:24,550
YouTube anybody still use tumblr cool

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,680
keep it up alright so that the interview

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,390
was all about talking about all these

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,890
new up-and-comer hip up-and-coming

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,930
hip-hop artists and like getting into

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,300
hip-hop and how to how do you find the

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,769
sauce a secret sauce and he had a one

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,660
line answer which is like he's just

00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:40,120
looking at him looking at the reporter

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,860
and it's like you don't got sauce then

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,390
he lost and I was like the pretty much

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,310
the whole interview and it was like it

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,980
just went in like history of like memes

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:51,490
for like years I think it's still pretty

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,769
much referenced today on worldstar you

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,870
guys on worldstar it should be alright

00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:57,220
but I say that because I wanted to build

00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,019
an open-source project to manage my

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,490
open-source projects so I wanted to get

00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:03,519
over the source and have like this like

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,079
pseudo CRM tool and I built it and I

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,390
built it because of Gucci Mane I called

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,520
it open sauce that's actually the actual

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,199
TLD I got so open sauce that pizza and

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,549
that's what it looks like it's not the

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,140
greatest like I wouldn't recommend using

00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:15,549
it it doesn't even work anymore because

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,500
I haven't supported in like six months

00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,329
but I weren't grachi well on this

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,850
project so I was able to sample graph QL

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,100
sample a public API get an idea what it

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:27,549
was and then I was able to bring graph

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,740
GL to my work so all it is is basically

00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:33,160
a CRM tool it's a way for me to save and

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,600
take save issues which as of three weeks

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,830
ago this is like pretty much not

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,400
non-existent because now you can

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:41,980
actually save you can bookmark issues

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,030
through directly from the profile which

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,020
you should just look it up in a blog

00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:48,880
post but at this point I was just I was

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,890
generally just hungry to learn and graph

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,780
Kewell and the github api couldn't serve

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,330
my needs from that point and more

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,530
architecture a lot of boxes this is

00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,110
actually what it looks like so I was

00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,250
able to use the graphical API serve it

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,020
to Apollo because I was doing a lot of

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,700
react at the time and then I Apollo

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,170
actually talked to Prisma as well so I

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,290
had two different schemas that were sort

00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:11,740
of like side-by-side and it was about my

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,420
attempt of sampling graph QL I do also

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,550
to mention that I did have two tubes I

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,690
do have two different schemas but today

00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,070
like you could literally just stitch

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,720
that together with a lot of these tools

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,260
like including Prisma which we heard

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,970
about earlier today so some questions

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,310
that a lot of people ask me upstairs is

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,920
who is actually using graph the github

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:32,020
Dracula API we have a lot of like we

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,240
have a lot of users in general on github

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,100
we have a slightly smaller number of

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,920
people integrating on our platform but

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,650
our biggest user is us we have 200 plus

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,020
engineers that are all shipping schema

00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,580
updates and graph QL to our projects so

00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,190
everything you see on github.com is

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,000
actually being powered in my graph QL I

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,770
also want to mention that last year I

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,240
spoke I did like a very brief lightning

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:57,160
talk on wrappers and we're basically a

00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,750
graph QL gateway so I built a wrapper

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,040
around my REST API that's how that was

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,840
my introduction to graph QL because I

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,940
could not go back to the backend team

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,000
and say please grachi well they would

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,130
say yeah haha no way so that talk was

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,500
all focused around sampling rest to

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,180
power my grackle api the cool thing

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,280
about github is that we're using github

00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,650
to power our REST API so I mentioned

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,380
every single thing at github is actually

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,760
graph QL we now have a REST API to

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,740
support our so we have we still have a

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,900
REST API that stand up that's still

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:30,220
being stood up by a graph QL schema so I

00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,900
talked about Tupac and I talked about

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,070
Biggie and like how gangster rap sort of

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,560
died

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:38,710
I think 2016 was like the year everybody

00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,930
was like rest is dead medium post hacker

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,910
news no more no more rest

00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:46,210
because graph QL is now the new king of

00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:48,010
api's and I'm a big fan of saying

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,300
addresses not dead like we don't have to

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,890
do like this East Coast West Coast thing

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,230
about resting rock you all if you use

00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,580
any rest like use rest and then figure

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,340
out a way to transition it if it makes

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,500
sense for your team and then open source

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,260
it so that we could all sort of build

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,510
and sort of

00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,860
move on I think the best thing about at

00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,230
that time when Puff Daddy was sort of

00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,390
doing the sampling and he moved on rap

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,800
moved on like hip-hop gone it made room

00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:12,320
for new people and it was less about

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,420
gangster violence so I would honestly

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,370
say like honestly we have every single

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,320
sponsor here on this in this room has a

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,030
different situation a different tool to

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,710
solve certain problems like there's room

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,970
for everybody to be in the space so I

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,140
would say let's just move forward and I

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,370
think the best thing about that we

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,610
launched on Monday was graph QL

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,020
Foundation which is still in the works

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,390
which github I think will put

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,760
potentially a big part of it we want a

00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,960
bluegrass go forward so let's let's not

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,160
do this whole East Coast West Coast

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,810
thing let's just move forward

00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,270
take the tool that works and then blog

00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,760
write about it speak on this stage and

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,770
that'll be awesome for everybody so with

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,200
that being said REST API our github

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,240
recipe API is not going anywhere

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,590
like we're supporting Enterprise you're

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,970
supporting all these other people were

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,710
integrating on platform for the past ten

00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,830
years it would be silly for us to be

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,300
like all right good luck we don't want

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,800
to do that like that's not what we're

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,540
about we're we're here to support the

00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,100
developer community and then move out of

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,700
the way and if you need help we'll be

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,710
we'll be pretty close by so this talk

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,060
itself also was about improving your

00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,330
experience so I'm gonna talk about

00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:16,000
github apps pretty briefly who has a

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,560
good map where ever used to github app

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,930
get up integration yeah so this is like

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,330
a term that actually came out this tool

00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:25,520
came out our framework of building api's

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,410
on RIT I came out the same year Brack

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,690
you all came out our public API so to

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,460
sort of took second seat to all the

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,440
announcements but it's actually a really

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,170
cool like a bit like a way for you to

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,640
get flexibility to our integrators so if

00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,170
you're in a granite platform definitely

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,940
check this out and the best way to check

00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,010
this out is by our open source framework

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,540
like a solo engineer built this in tied

00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,400
inside getting at github and he

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,080
open-source at the entire time and now

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,880
we're supporting this full time so it's

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,500
called pro bot it's a really easy way

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,390
it's built on node and JavaScript it's

00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,160
easy way to build integration to github

00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,570
so if you have a very tedious thing with

00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,100
open source or a tedious ting and your

00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,750
workflow that you want to improve with

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,220
github or a feature that's missing you

00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,450
could possibly do this on the github API

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,250
using Probot

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,820
and it's really all about automating

00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,680
workflows by leveraging the github API

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,200
we do all these repeated tasks every

00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,580
single day like every time an issue note

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,900
is open like you need to notify

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,220
somebody every time a pull request is

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,110
open you should probably set the slack

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,610
message and the cool thing about this is

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,590
we have integrators today who are

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,360
already doing this so blur binders is

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,160
one developer based out of Chicago he

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,020
gave a talk at github universe look it

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,640
up if you're interested but he had a

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,790
problem when he was a CTO of a company

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,080
and he wanted to let like the team they

00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,280
did to let people know when the floor

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,130
requests are open so it'd be like

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:40,160
constant like slack notifications like

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,870
hey look at my PR next day look at my PR

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,040
so he built up he built a product and

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,230
now he's doing this full-time it's

00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,910
called pool reminders so he was able to

00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,440
identify we want to look at pull

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,760
requests at least once a day or twice a

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,070
day so you could actually set up

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,960
notifications on every single PR and you

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,880
can be set up like who to assign the PR

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,940
to directly from this tool so he built

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,740
this on the grass or than the github API

00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,090
and it's all about listening so

00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,260
listening the web hooks on our API so

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,210
he's just listening for every pleura

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,890
quests open and we build that with robot

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,560
so he's using proba and he's able to use

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,060
use that directly in line another brief

00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,190
example too is that every time you open

00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,220
an issue it's a triage I like ad needs

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,650
response like so Bex whatever interns

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,860
for previous past two summers built this

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,150
this bot they basically just add a

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,190
simple label it's like super trivial

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,900
it's not something we'll probably spend

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,400
a lot of engineering time at github to

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,980
solve because you can actually solve

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,810
this yourself and now every time an

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,670
issue is open you have a whole list of

00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,440
needs response Monday morning or

00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,120
whatever day you check you is triage

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,360
issues you just check them right off -

00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,830
right off the bat robot itself is built

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,150
on top of octave kids so if you ever did

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,640
any sort of interaction with get up API

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,020
we do have a library that we support in

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,760
the community supports which is called

00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,220
octo kit so it's interactions with the

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,230
API it's like better or so SDL or if you

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,360
if you want to call it or yeah it's

00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,130
better language to interact with and as

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,770
of today you can use graph QL directly

00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,300
within robot and octo kit so that's how

00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,010
you do it and you can go ahead and build

00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,360
your schemas it's actually like so this

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,280
is huge for me I didn't know about this

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,990
I came from a company that we had an

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,070
entire API file of all these

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,020
interactions there are one-to-one

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,180
mirrored from to get up API because

00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,430
that's what we needed and instead of

00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,750
doing that I don't have to do that

00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:19,340
anymore because github provides the

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,170
opportunity with the graphical API to

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,240
solve you can create functions based on

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,760
solutions not on endpoints and that

00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,370
looks like this so I've got a query that

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,470
I can just drop in an explorer anywhere

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,600
that's using our that has the API or a

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,160
graphical API attached to it and I can

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,930
find all contributors based on my

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,450
organization's so if I'm a open source

00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,890
project I would I like send a t-shirt or

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,750
send a message to everybody who's

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,880
contributed the past year I can sort of

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,960
set that up and grachi well and that

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,850
would normally take like five different

00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,950
endpoints on the REST API that's just

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,200
one graph QL query now it's massive

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,480
actually sir I've seen bigger graph

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,490
field queries to be honest so it is cut

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,809
off a little bit but I can solve that

00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,700
problem extract that it's some sort of

00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:02,559
library file and pull that into whatever

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:04,059
client that I'm using for SQL so I do

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,770
want to point out that github also

00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:07,450
constantly getting interactions on our

00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,370
API we're constantly shipping we've got

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,820
a lot of Engineers I didn't mentioned

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,440
we're hiring so I'll just say that once

00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,970
but we just launched in June we launched

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,530
this new thing called the checks API and

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,090
the checks API provides you

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,610
sophisticated feedback directly and

00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,929
github so tools like Travis who normally

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,179
have like commits statuses and that

00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:27,510
little box in your PR box you can now

00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:29,679
have way more fine-grained feedback

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:33,520
instead of going back to Travis for that

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,350
those details here we are the checks API

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,630
actually provides that data in line so

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,520
as of today every pull request you open

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,750
has a checks tab and that checks tab if

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,850
you have any check any sort of

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,030
integrations installed like Travis that

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,380
used the checks API actually apollo's a

00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,390
platform the engine actually also uses

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,920
the checks API as well so they have that

00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:54,850
you will see that if you couldn't make

00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:57,429
that connection so I went made a a PR

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,990
and I opened it up and added a one

00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:00,250
markdown file that had Beyonce's lyrics

00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,500
so because I'm talking about the checks

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,270
API Beyonce has a song called check on

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,070
it you probably haven't heard of it

00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:09,190
because it was in the soundtrack for a

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,540
Pink Panther like back in 2007 and no

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,250
one watched that movie said anyway it's

00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,100
a good song you should check it out but

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,929
I just add a kid in the PR I added two I

00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:20,350
added yeah I added the PR and I also

00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:21,940
installed a github app this github app

00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:24,580
is using the open source of JavaScript

00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,620
library called Alex and Alex actually

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,210
goes through your your PRS and checks

00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,880
for instance and Timothy so if you're

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,380
like not using gender pronouns properly

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,940
or if you using something like you know

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,920
curse words and that's not okay for your

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,870
team how it should actually rate like

00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,390
say something the bot will say hey maybe

00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,140
use something else so I did that on this

00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,610
repo

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,220
and then you can see my tab right here

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,660
is to do checks API and then I had it on

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,910
that tab I have all these details

00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,260
annotations based on the feedback that

00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:53,140
alex has given me based on my

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,120
sensitivity so looking up closely I'm

00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,190
using the word girl and Alex has

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,560
actually recommended me use kid instead

00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,910
so very generic obviously you wouldn't

00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
use this like in production like if

00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,760
you're writing songs probably use a

00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,380
better tool than get up

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,870
but maybe where the tool for writing

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,760
music so maybe I'll just retract my

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,630
statement and the other cool thing is

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,070
you can click through from those

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,570
annotations and look exactly exactly

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,430
what the file has been changed and

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,570
because of three weeks ago we launched

00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,190
another feature which is called

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,420
suggested changes you actually make

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:25,270
those changes directly inline without

00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:27,670
cloning and shipping that again so sort

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,170
of rounding this all up I want to

00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:31,570
mention that you can actually build

00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,550
graph QL into your workflow like we have

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,410
an API we have integrations we have

00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,570
github apps like you could build and

00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,340
improve your workflow today using gibbs

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,840
graph because like i think most of us

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,780
are half of us at least Rose our hand

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,940
said we use github maybe other people

00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,280
have other solutions but look for ways

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,930
to do it one other I just want to make a

00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,110
quick footnote to yesterday we had a

00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:55,330
talk mark Andre mentioned that we were

00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,800
seeing graph QL dr. and this is a this

00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,070
is actually a github app built up robot

00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,690
actually it's not building for a bot I

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,940
don't know actually it's rails anyway

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:06,490
sorry I don't want to mince my words so

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,320
graph field doctors built its internal

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,000
for us it solves all our problems and

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,470
every bike pretty much everybody heard

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,060
that went upstairs and asked me an azide

00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,730
open sourced can I use it and I would

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,020
say no you can't because we're not going

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,210
to open source it solves our problems

00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,370
but I also would say literally James

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:23,740
talked for like a section of his talk

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,930
and has the same sort of like one

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,670
feature which is graph QL doctor is in

00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,470
and Paulo's engine so you can actually

00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:31,390
just connect that connect your Apollo

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,740
engine your Apollo platform whatever

00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,440
they're calling it today I'm not really

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:37,150
clear install that and you have that

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,710
well we're using you already have it

00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,120
look Apollo so if you are using Apollo I

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,580
also want to mention that graph Gale

00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,230
doctor is open source because mark gave

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,850
the talk like four weeks ago and someone

00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:48,490
saw the talk and they reverse engineered

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,750
and open sourced it so I also want to

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,190
say you can also use that it's open

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,430
source figure it out if it works for you

00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,140
so one other thing is the checks API is

00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,820
and developer

00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,170
so you actually unfortunately can't use

00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,020
an explorer we're trying to mirror

00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,730
production data and the Explorer but the

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,140
cool thing is open source so graphical

00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,540
playground exists so you can actually

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,790
just add your AP the graph QL API

00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,920
directly to the playground make sure you

00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:13,050
provide your token to and github we have

00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,280
documentation on that check it out and

00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,880
you can actually sample graph kill

00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,820
anywhere you want using github data so

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,800
use a grafter explorer and get sampling

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,480
i do want to mention that we do have

00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,100
github community so if you have

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,600
something that like a mutation or query

00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,490
that's missing that you would love the

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,140
seed to support your business or your

00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,210
integration let us know in the community

00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,400
forum this exists i didn't know this

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,690
existed because i'm the type of person

00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,100
it was like hey i don't want to ask for

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,140
help because i should know this

00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,060
don't do that don't be like me ask for

00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,280
help ask for questions or reach out to

00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,500
me on Twitter to ask me questions

00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,220
another thing is that we recently

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,290
deprecated some things that we're not

00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,700
being used in graphical and July we have

00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,980
a whole talk about data from graphical

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,300
Europe but we do have a change log so we

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,860
do make changes like that we have a

00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,960
change log which you can check out and

00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:01,470
with that being said I am V Dugger yo
