Description: 
	Talk from GraphQL Summit 2018 - Nov 8, 2018

Brian Douglas is a Developer Advocate at GitHub where he works on increasing use of the GitHub API by helping users through technical content and examples. He focuses his day to day work on developer engagement through the GiHub Developer Program by fostering a community for 3rd party API development. The move to GraphQL marked a larger shift in GitHub's Platform strategy towards more transparency and more flexibility in our API. Over the past year, GitHub has been iterating on their schema to bring it closer towards feature completeness and strengthening the use for 3rd party integrators. Join me in walking through some of the newer ways developers are leveraging our API primitives and benefiting from GraphQL adoption into their development workflow.
