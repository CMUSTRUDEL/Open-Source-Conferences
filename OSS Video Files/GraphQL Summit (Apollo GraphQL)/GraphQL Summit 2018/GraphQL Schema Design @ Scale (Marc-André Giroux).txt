	Talk from GraphQL Summit 2018 - Nov 7, 2018

Marc-André Giroux, Platform Interface Engineer at GitHub, is trying to help build better APIs. 
GraphQL's type system is what makes it so powerful. However, as our schemas grow, they sometimes become hard to evolve, hard to reason about, and hard to use for our integrators. Over the past 3 years, he's observed the good, the bad, and ugly in GraphQL schemas. These are his findings.
