	Talk from GraphQL Summit 2018 - Nov 7, 2018

Using Apollo, we can write directives to supercharge our schemas with custom behavior. Let's talk about how to write custom directives and the benefits they offer.

Ryan Chenkie, Trainer/Developer at Angularcasts.io, is a full-stack JavaScript developer, trainer, and Google Developer Expert and believes that GraphQL's schema language is beautiful. It allows us to author data models concisely and communicate with teammates clearly.
