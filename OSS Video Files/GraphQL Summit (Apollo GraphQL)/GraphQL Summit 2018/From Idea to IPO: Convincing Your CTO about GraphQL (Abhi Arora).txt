okay hi

00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:11,820
so before we start the talk just wanted

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,849
to say thank you for everybody who voted

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,460

for our democracy so really appreciate

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:25,529
who ever voted and secondly congrats to

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,140
the community for coming so far and

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,239
making it to the Linux Foundation it's

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,640
really good to see the community growing

00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:36,620
at this pace so what's this talk about

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,810
[Music]

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,670
this talk is about you are really

00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,750
excited about a technology like graph QL

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:50,880
and what can you do to convince your

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,290
team your CTO your executives to also be

00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,050
as excited about the technology and

00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,440
adopt it

00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:04,049
so is graph QL plus your management does

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:07,340
it get you happiness yes or no right so

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:11,520
Who am I and what's the backstory like

00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:15,380
why am I talking about graph QL so I am

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,720
CTO and co-founder of hire card the

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:23,190
peer-to-peer rental car platform for

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,360
uber lyft drivers we are like said we

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:34,190
are car sharing for ride-sharing drivers

00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:37,140
why did we do this we four years ago we

00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,659
met a lot while taking over left rides

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,760
we met a lot of drivers about 30 percent

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:48,770
of them that were renting cars and the

00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:51,930
cost there was no open marketplace they

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:54,030
only met one guy who had one offer and

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,740
they had to take it right so we said

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,530
okay what can we do to help these

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,140
drivers there why don't we create a

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,380
marketplace where anybody can be a car

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,200
owner and give least the cars to these

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,319
drivers who are starting their careers

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,299
so we create this marketplace it's going

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,010
really well in four years we went from

00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:21,099
two guys at Starbucks

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:24,040
to an IPO or Nasdaq last June we really

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,439
followed the lean philosophy as we were

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,220
growing and we only build things that

00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,540
our customers really really wanted so we

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,790
didn't build any sophisticated

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,659
technologies there's an engineer I was

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:40,629
really used to so by the time it came

00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:42,519
down to IPO you were like oh crap like

00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:44,230
with this money what do we want to do we

00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:50,170
really want to scale we cannot scale on

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:52,030
this brittle back end right so that's

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,849
that's why we decided to rewrite the

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,370
entire back end in two months

00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:59,379
before the IPO I know it sounds crazy

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,310
but we did it

00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:06,519
and you're reaping the benefits now so

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:10,420
before we go into the graph QL part have

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,310
a couple of questions has how many hair

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,409
work for a start-up or have worked for a

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:23,129
start-up Wow and how many have

00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:26,079
participated in a venture round thanks

00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:28,090
so one of the key questions that I keep

00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:31,599
getting gasps is like okay why did you

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,930
go I peel why not is funding from other

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,019
sources so just wanted to go through our

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:41,260
thought process we were exploring Lisi

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:44,169
is private equity and the public markets

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,989
right and you're looking at okay what

00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:47,579
are the key criterias that will help us

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,379
succeed

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:52,720
what is the market condition the market

00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:55,389
conditions for VCS private equity were

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,699
doing phenomenal but you're also seeing

00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:00,340
this new opportunity with the public

00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:03,790
markets and we were estimating that if

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,260
we launched an IPO on time the markets

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,260
are heating up and there'll be enough

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,510
volume there and that happen as you can

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,079
see there's a lot of hype you cite in

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:16,889
this year and then the next question was

00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:21,220
okay how can we get the best valuation

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:23,919
for and keep as much control as possible

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,340
of the company right and that the best

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,020
option was there again the IPO and

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,840
finally burst but

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:36,580
importantly how can we provide liquidity

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:39,340
to our employees the fastest and our

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,320
existing shareholders that those are the

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,610
reasons that you know were considered

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,530
before we went public

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,030
how many Before we jump into graphic

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,950
another question how many people here

00:04:49,030 --> 00:05:02,530
are either managers or senior executives

00:04:52,950 --> 00:05:04,750
okay so for everybody else how I cannot

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,030
speak for all the managers here but for

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,310
everybody else I want to walk you guys

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,470
through the journey of for a startup

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:15,250
what did it take what was the decision

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:21,400
process what do you take for us to adopt

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:23,260
graph QL and as as an executive I'm

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,800
always looking at a couple of things

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:29,890
before to evaluate a new technology and

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,710
one is what is the business opportunity

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,870
right what how does what does the

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:38,220
customer want and how how will this

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,710
technology help the customer and

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,260
secondly what is the risk factor what

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,630
does this what what are the risk coming

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,830
into this technology that I should be

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,910
aware of so if you're bringing those two

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,300
if you're taking care of those two

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,790
topics I think it will be very very

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,450
beneficial to your managers to your

00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:04,450
executives if you can bring them up and

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:06,220
explain those two things so the very

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:10,090
first thing is what is the opportunity

00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,720
for us it was post IPO we really wanted

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,760
to scale we really wanted to grow fast

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:23,110
with the funding that was raised and

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:26,260
what does part of the scaling is we have

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:30,070
the scale efficiently we don't want cost

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,630
to go crazy we don't we want speed and

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,090
flexibility we want to be able to

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,730
iterate and build features that the

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:40,210
customers want and not spend too much

00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:42,490
time on maintenance and then we want

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,910
stability we are going to spend the next

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:49,300
two months rewriting a back-end that is

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:51,220
working in production we are crazy but

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:56,710
we don't want to do it again ever right

00:06:51,220 --> 00:07:02,410
or for as long as possible so the first

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:04,240
part of something that the first part is

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,539
speed and flexibility okay how are we

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,860
addressing how does graph QL perform on

00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:14,650
speed and flexibility graph QL really

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,409
helps us by allowing us to have one

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:21,069
single API for multiple clients we want

00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:24,099
our customers want apps they want web UI

00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,539
there I'm sure you know a few years down

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,840
the length they'll want I want like a

00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:32,680
voice controller or an app on the phone

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,470
so it really it really works for that

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:40,180
case and now we're launching apps that

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:43,599
are built on a graph QL UI API then we

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:47,590
warned graph QL is very it decouples

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,229
your client from your service and by

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,919
doing that it let it lets us build and

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:56,349
play around with our on the client side

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:59,050
and do a/b testing to make sure that our

00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:00,250
customers are we can adopt to our

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,770
customers needs right

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,990
and same thing on the back end so we can

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,240
add and remove services without

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,389
affecting and breaking our existing

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:16,210
clients so it really helps speed up

00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:20,080
development the other thing that graph

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:23,770
QL has really helped us it has been the

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,380
developer experience so not only is it

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:29,860
easier to read it's also easier to

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,969
onboard and it has been easier to

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:36,250
onboard engineers because now they have

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:41,380
just one place to go to look at the

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:44,070
entire data available instead of going

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,810
through multiple traditional api's and

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,779
playing around with exactly what does

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:52,290
which they paid us for and then we have

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:56,200
an amazing community around graph QL

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:58,870
like Apollo Prisma playground

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,380
that provides all the tooling that or a

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:06,310
lot of tooling that helps build these

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:11,940
things build both the back end and the

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:16,900
clients foster so scaling efficiently

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:19,450
like I said for me it is scaling is how

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,210
can we keep how can we prevent cause

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:27,190
from growing up linearly as we get more

00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:30,220
and more customers since our IPO we have

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:34,210
doubled our user base that's been a few

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:36,550
months and but our costs have only gone

00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,580
up few percentage points so that's

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,830
really exciting for us and how graph QL

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,550
provided for that was with smaller

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,930
payloads reduced a lot of round trips

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,380
the round trips to our servers have gone

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,590
down to 1/3 of what on average on what

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:56,170
it used to be with traditional IT guys

00:09:52,590 --> 00:10:02,410
it also has helped scale our developers

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:05,320
from by providing unified a single

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:08,980
umbrella to play around with multiple

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:15,750
micro services third party services our

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:24,910
data layer our OEM layer and lastly to

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:27,730
stability so stability for us is we

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,430
don't want to redo this for a while we

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:35,410
also don't want the clients to suffer

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:40,240
from any kind of outages or as you know

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:43,260
as much as we can avoid so graph QL

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,590
again like I said really helps that by

00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:49,540
decoupling and letting us play around on

00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:53,710
both the client side and the server side

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:56,380
without breaking both parties it has a

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:59,920
large and more importantly a very

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:02,650
fast-growing community so we know that

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,880
it's not going away yesterday was you

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:10,440
know proof of that it has we used

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,360
typescript and typescript provided us

00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:18,310
strong that strong typing across the

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:22,020
board and that helps us dive into that

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:27,490
gives us like a very granular control on

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:31,779
error handling analytics we can monitor

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:36,190
using a poll engine exactly which query

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:36,760
is performing good or bad and why is it

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,959
doing that

00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,209
right and it's also from an engineering

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,390
perspective it's self documenting so you

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:48,190
have to write less and less documents

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:54,790
and you know less maintenance of your

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:56,980
documentation so in addition to all the

00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,290
exciting opportunities it's also really

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,420
important to understand what are some of

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:05,980
the risks that come with this technology

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:07,690
and that's that's what when I was an

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,500
engineer I've been in ninjatroll all my

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,930
life and I used to get really excited

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,800
about all the cutting edge signals I

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:21,220
just wanted to jump in but as a manager

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:25,420
now I have to understand what are the

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:31,089
risk that could happen that would affect

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:33,040
my customers right so one of the key and

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,220
why is wireless understanding this is

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,800
important is because you want to be able

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,320
to you want to plan for it and then you

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,140
want to mitigate those risks so some of

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,790
the risks are we knew going in it would

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,970
be it's a new technology it's going to

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:53,380
be really hard to hire for a graph QL

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:56,079
engineer so we plan to train our

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,670
existing engineers or bring in a strong

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:02,230
JavaScript engineers in the strain the

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:05,470
amount of cure the community vial has it

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,120
has amazing tooling and it's growing it

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,240
still needs more there's certain edge

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,810
cases that are still that still need

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,810
coverage

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:17,750
and like query complexity rate limiting

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,930
caching error handling they all could be

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,930
better

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:30,650
so has graph QL made us happier has that

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:32,720
adopt it's absolutely yes but given a

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,370
different context give given a different

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,710
business problem would we have SIL done

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:43,130
it we don't know so what is the current

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:48,770
state of graph QL and the tooling around

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:50,839
graph QL at hired car we have being we

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,880
have done really well on performance we

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,029
have doubled our customers but we have

00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:00,010
improved the performance of our APs

00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:02,990
we have had really phenomenal stability

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:05,300
because we can track down exactly what

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:09,110
is happening why is it happening very

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:12,830
quickly the development work has moved

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:16,480
from maintaining API is making back-end

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:20,240
changes to more front-end iterations

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,070
more customers and focused work so it

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,000
has really helped us knock out a lot of

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:30,770
features so what are some of the tools

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,680
that we use you guys all know Apollo we

00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:36,530
use Apollo engine heavily and a lot of

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:43,060
other tools provided by Apollo this is a

00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:43,060
screen shot from us a latency monitoring

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,420
we use Prisma a lot of things Prisma is

00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,120
done for the community has been super

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,540
beneficial and we use it on a day to day

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,540
basis

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,339
playground by Prisma is something that

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:06,920
we love it lets us see the schema or

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:11,089
api's and test our queries so shout out

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:13,940
to Prisma apollo playground and very

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:16,490
important the training tool that Prisma

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:22,610
has how to graph QL so shout out you

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:25,150
guys thanks for building these and shout

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,670
out to the crazy team who helped us

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,860
in two months rewrite the entire bike

00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,010
and started to know him this sitting

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,010
right here

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,840
[Applause]

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:40,300
you're hiding you're growing like crazy

00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,540
we are in downtown Los Angeles so if you

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,820
want to work with some of the latest and

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,370
greatest tech and be in the mobility

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,740
space please shoot out an email see a

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,320
software we are with knowing we are
