Publication date: 2018-12-05
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2018
Description: 
	Talk from GraphQL Summit 2018 - Nov 8, 2018

Ivan Goncharov, GraphQL Consultant at APIs.guru, is active in GraphQL community and one of the core contributors to graphql-js. We all love GraphQL query syntax because it’s simple and easy to learn. At the same time, it has a few useful features that are typically overlooked. If you think that you already know everything about GraphQL queries this talk is for you. Warning: this talk will contain spoilers from GraphQL Spec

the effect for great introduction also

00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:13,080
thanks to Jeff Smith for shoutouts

00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:15,670
yesterday so I yeah I'm work on

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,130
graphical specification and graphical JS

00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,619
and because I contributed to this

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,710
project and not only like Gordon pr's

00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:25,989
but I review a lot of the arts and I

00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,700
answer a lot of issues so I don't some

00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:29,800
interesting stuff about graph clearly

00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,079
and what you can do inside your queries

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,600
so let's start from something like

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:38,350
simple like simple query nothing special

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,870
the most interesting stuff here so I can

00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:45,940
win fragment but you probably do it in

00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:49,630
every almost every queries but what if

00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,440
we remove one part is it like while it

00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,550
were you're not

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,710
who think it's invalid choir and you

00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,140
definitely you know it's like it's it's

00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,960
a trick that's why I show it so

00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,420
graphical happy visit so it done doesn't

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,880
have add anything if it's think it's

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,620
valid what what about 0 so we send it to

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,420
a server server actually send us

00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,940
response so it's working

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,310
so when up with like whispered

00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,860
construction with show quake objects

00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,979
right and JavaScript is it back a

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:25,000
feature I don't know why could find out

00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:27,310
so like a first place to walk file for

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,400
information about graph kill it graph QL

00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,890
or website and if you go there there is

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,850
like a bunch of menu options to choose

00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,990
from and there is excellent tutorial and

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,869
you should definitely check it out if

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,630
you starting with graph key but today we

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,580
go beyond that because tutorial doesn't

00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:49,030
contain answer to this question we go

00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:52,869
directly to to the spec and on this page

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,610
you see also releases previous releases

00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:58,750
of specification in the release notes

00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:02,049
and before June 2008 units actually was

00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,659
working draft and we just like like

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,360
three months ago four months ago we had

00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,700
like first type of release and we'll use

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,120
it today so it's like a first page of

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,519
really one document and you can be

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,450
tempted to actually print it out but

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,790
before doing that

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,069
actually change the number of pages

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,430
because actually did that and here's the

00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:26,230
end result and it was even hard to find

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,930
the bin door I went through a couple of

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,790
stores asking and I always show that to

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,790
store owner and say wait can you give

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:38,260
myself into feet with swag

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:39,970
so let's go to table of content even

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,019
table of contact whose looks

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,430
intimidating what should you start I

00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,799
personally really like Appendix B

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,370
because it's contained a really short

00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:55,360
and compact grammar summary for entire

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:58,810
graph gear and if you open a subsection

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,630
about document about my query or HDL

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:05,440
documents and find rules about the

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:08,680
fragments and what's who look how

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,630
through supply to acquire II so first we

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,690
need to equate the fragment in wine

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:16,840
fragment which is pretty easy when we

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,910
will much like three dots and when the

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,130
finally see type condition and things to

00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,980
note here is the type condition is

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:28,359
optional so we we can safely remove it

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:31,329
so we absolutely sure hundred percent

00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:34,180
sure it's illegal but it's the liver

00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:36,910
citizen so why it was added and how it's

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,660
useful in real life what white way it's

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:43,900
possible so this is created from a

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:48,190
section about any wine fragment and its

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:50,079
have example and it's explained that in

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,280
one fragment can be used up wide

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:56,709
directives to to a set of fields so it's

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,930
especially useful with skip and include

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,380
instead of duplicate and skip include on

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,849
every field you can just group them

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,049
inside the new one fragment and up white

00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:09,359
directive

00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:11,950
two of them at the same time so like

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:15,549
from private concept those go to

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,650
something basic and 2x 0 XR is the most

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:24,610
simplest part of like programming

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:28,630
languages can see can be some yeah so

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:31,720
what you can notice that there is two

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,750
two syntax two ways to describe strings

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,229
in graph here and one of them we all

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,789
know it's like just quotation mark but

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:42,130
graphically also will be to specify like

00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:46,930
triple quotations strings or box strings

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:48,969
and like from with grammar rule we can

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,800
see it start from triple quotation and

00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:52,330
ripple quotation but we don't know

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,780
anything else about it

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,820
so graphical specification I have really

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,690
cool feature you can click on any row

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,430
and you go directly to a section

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,880
explaining it in more details and

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:09,370
providing examples so let's do that

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,530
with this example from a spec and it

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:16,719
show how you can provide such trinkle

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:19,840
mutation and its work by graphical just

00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:22,090
removal as starting and trailing us and

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,090
also remove common annotation so it's

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,630
what similar to Bach strings in llamó if

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,700
you previously use it and basically with

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,700
request is equivalent to this one just

00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,280
like we took nicely and you can use

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,669
books linked in any place where you

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:46,570
using normal strings so it can be like

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:48,880
directives arguments anywhere yeah what

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:53,919
about numbers numbers of usually pretty

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:57,789
simple can can something you can can say

00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,340
surprise you and you can see like

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:02,740
exponent part rule and probably you

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:07,300
guess it described exponent part of a

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,710
number E and graph will have a graph

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,349
here spec have another really cool

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,389
feature if you put your cursor on some

00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:15,909
row its highlight of occurrence of this

00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:19,419
row in other roots so we can see it's

00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:21,599
using forward numbers so you can craft

00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:25,090
yellow so provide this example for that

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:29,620
so you can write numbers for exert and

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:32,649
the last example and I wanted it to be

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,320
something very wise simple and basic so

00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:35,900
it's a first page of grammar summary it

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,419
says

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,820
like the very basic things of roughly

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,970
Arabic what kind of source characters

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,340
you can use and also ignored tokens and

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,070
what exciting about ignorant Rockets

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:53,630
it's about you to do minification of a

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:55,520
graphical queries which is the query we

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,310
start with and we can start by removing

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,860
the comments and after we remove a

00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,139
comments we can remove of the spices and

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:07,759
after we remove the spices we can remove

00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:10,910
all new wines and after we remove all

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:15,889
new wines here is the end result and we

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:23,500
started from 253 bytes and the end

00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:26,030
result is actually 37% smaller and like

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,880
when I work on this presentation start

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:32,360
working on it like more than a month ago

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,430
like month and a half ago and I put a

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,610
lot of quite cool features about rock

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,820
rock lyrics you can it depends on

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,070
definition oh cool feature and I just

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,039
remove them because it's not the main

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,470
purpose of his talk like main purpose of

00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:51,500
his talk is to show you that there is

00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,630
like a lot of exciting things inside

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,789
graph key because it's pretty big

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,650
document is pretty big aspect and today

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,070
I just saw like some things about YT

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:04,539
syntax the riswick SDLC indexes type

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:11,960
system introspection query responses and

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:13,729
I used in my solitary screenshots from

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,099
graph theory specification not because

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:19,039
not only because I'm wiser but also to

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:21,949
show you that graphical spec is like

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,240
really cool spec was there is a lot of

00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,800
effort that was put to make it readable

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,020
to have it a nice format in syntax

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,400
Coweta cross-links and a lot of examples

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,979
and it's not only formatting it's like

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,000
design principle graph gives back

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,789
because one of the design principles

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,570
actually like understand villages just

00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:47,570
importance correctness is basically spec

00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,330
was designed to be read the ball not

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,760
only way

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,790
by implementers of graphically why

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,700
berries or compacts tooling but by any

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,680
person who interested in graphical so I

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,810
encourage you to try to read this but

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,480
next time you have some question or try

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,690
to the second feature of graph here try

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,670
open and read this back even my godson

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,040
tried to read the spec for a couple of

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:14,190
minutes like it was only a couple mins

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,380
but yeah and if you have any question

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:20,430
about graph jjs about a graphical

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,800
specification you can contact me we can

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,230
discuss it in the conference of wine and

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,779
I have like I have graphical

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,459
specification with me I can help you to

00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:34,020
find an answer I can even give you a

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:37,320
page with an answer yeah thanks

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,320
