the once kalasa family left Poland in

00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:12,090
the late 1800s and they emigrated to the

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,160
North America they landed in Canada

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,160
originally and then they moved to the

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,060
northeastern United States after the

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,720
turn of the century

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,060
for the brothers in 1918 they wanted to

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,610
get in on the brand-new motion picture

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,350
industry so they moved out to Hollywood

00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,740
California and they bought some property

00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:34,199
off Sunset Boulevard be able to start

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,679
making pictures within just a couple

00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:40,019
years a rescue dog off the battlefields

00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,269
of World War one became the first big

00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:44,519
film star for what was now Warner

00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:47,249
Brothers Studios the dog's name was Rin

00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:48,449
Tin Tin along with the Warner Brothers

00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:50,909
there were a number of other motion

00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:53,760
picture pioneers who set up shop in the

00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:56,609
larger LA basin and set Los Angeles on

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,579
the path to what it is now the center of

00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:02,549
the entertainment industry in the United

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,959
States and in the world the Warner

00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,000
Brothers they didn't just stop with one

00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:07,440
property on Sunset Boulevard they

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,960
realized how we really need some more

00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,490
land and so on the backside of the

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,970
Hollywood Hills in Burbank California

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,400
they bought a much larger property and

00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,680
today if you visit that area you'll see

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,730
the now iconic Warner Brothers water

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,590
tower on Warner Brothers Studios as you

00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,390
drive around the area you'll see some

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,890
kind of interesting stuff if you drive

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,170
around the area here what are you gonna

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,910
see a bunch of tech companies you're

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,490
gonna see a bunch of small companies

00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,780
that support the tech companies for

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,850
doing things like circuit board

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,130
prototyping maybe some custom new

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,830
software development if you go down to

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,650
LA you'll see this supporting ecosystem

00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,560
but it's not for technology it's for the

00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,150
entertainment industry a bunch of small

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,800
companies that provide specialized

00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:56,580
camera equipment or maybe they provide

00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:59,550
post-production services it's all built

00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,810
to support the larger film houses at

00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,190
film studios that you're familiar with

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,420
and one last thing I learned is I was

00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,459
preparing for this talk the Warner

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,259
Brothers years ago they sold that

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,370
original Sunset Boulevard property and

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,760
now today

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,959
it's known as sunset Bronson studios

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,629
there's still a bunch of sound stages

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,120
there where shows get made and there's

00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,830
also this 14 story office building and

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,920
if you go and drive by you'll see that

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,110
it is the center of Netflix operations

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,040
in Southern California in Los Angeles I

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,069
didn't even know that until I was

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,870
preparing for the talk maybe you knew

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,900
all about the once Colossus maybe you're

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,159
a film history buff you knew that all

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,549
those things but you don't know much

00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,160
about me so I grew up in the Bay Area

00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:46,019
I'm actually a local grew up in San Jose

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,269
which is right at the south end of the

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,980
San Francisco Bay I've got over 20 years

00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,230
of software development experience at

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,260
this point started off doing handhelds

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,540
moved into server software and

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,340
infrastructure lots of web application

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,829
development system integration mostly

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,819
back in tools the types of things that I

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:10,709
would call data plumbing lots of pipes

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:12,150
and filters and the other thing that

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,340
isn't immediately obvious about me is

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,690
that I'm a failed optometrist all

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,680
growing up if you ask me what are you

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,120
going to be when you grow up I said oh

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,310
I'm gonna be an optometrist because I

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,720
had to wear glasses I thought that seems

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,450
like a pretty good gig you get to help

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,970
people see better and I got in an

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,500
optometry school and the first day of

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,959
lab they have him pair up with somebody

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,120
else and then you take a q-tip and turn

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,910
the other person's eyelid inside out to

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,980
check for pathologies I never even

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,690
thought for a moment before that that I

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,500
would be touching people's eyeballs and

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,840
it freaked me out

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:48,299
so I got out of that got into software

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:50,190
and it's worked out alright so initially

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,440
I was doing C programming I'm gonna do a

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,540
little pendulum here then I went to Java

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,410
and then the last number of years I

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,590
spent a lot of work doing Ruby and now

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,449
I'm doing graph QL looking really

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,040
closely at it and I noticed there's this

00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:06,930
arc see he has really strong types

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,000
you're managing all your own memory Java

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,150
okay it's got types but they're more

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,620
loose and Ruby ah who needs types forget

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,840
all that stuff we're doing duck typing

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,690
but now we've swung back and graph

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,969
Sheila's got strong types kind of

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,190
interesting I joined Netflix in early

00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,020
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,110
really excited to be able to share with

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,150
you today what Netflix is doing to

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,180
impact the entertainment industry but

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,610
also how graph QL has changed how we're

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,700
thinking about the technology that we

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,040
bring to bear on this industry so in

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,900
order to understand that I need to take

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,720
you inside Netflix as an organization

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,580
and get you to kind of wrap your head

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,200
around the perspective that we need to

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,080
take in order to be effective inside the

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,880
larger organization if you're not

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,320
familiar with Netflix we are the world's

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,120
leading Internet sort of entertainment

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,220
service and my favorite part about

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,070
Netflix is we don't have any commitments

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,240
if you see something you see a show or

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,890
you hear about something you say I'd

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,230
like to watch that you get on Netflix

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,300
calm and within a couple minutes you're

00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,250
watching and then a day a week a month a

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,680
year from now you decide I'm really not

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,300
getting much from you guys turn it off

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,980
and if you change your mind you can turn

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,370
it back on again it's very very easy low

00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,370
friction

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,290
Netflix has a culture memo and I've got

00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,610
the URL up on the screen maybe some of

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,830
you read it maybe you happen but there's

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,130
three points from the culture memo that

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,330
really have bearing on the conversation

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,840
about how do you bring technology into

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,420
an organization and that the first one

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,310
is freedom and responsibility or F&R

00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,880
you'll hear people talk about FNR for

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,440
add Netflix what is F&R well as an

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,650
outsider it's kind of confusing as an

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,140
insider my perspective is I'm part of a

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,730
start-up inside of a larger organization

00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,770
we've got lots of tools and

00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,870
infrastructure to support us but it's up

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,930
to us to choose what technology are we

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,490
gonna use what how are we gonna build it

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,630
what are we gonna run and how are we

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,500
going to maintain it how we're gonna add

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,570
new features that's all on the team the

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,780
second thing is informed captains so

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,190
each team is made up of generally senior

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,390
engineers but then there's also one

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,340
person who's sort of the informed

00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,450
captain who if there's disagreement in

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,910
the team the other ones who are going to

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,830
make the ultimate decision and then the

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,380
third thing is highly aligned loosely

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,080
coupled to go with this idea that each

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,660
team is a ship with a captain that's

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,490
going in a direction there's lots of

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,720
micro services and lots of macro

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,940
services that Netflix that are all

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,620
moving in a direction together but it's

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,260
up to each of the captains to negotiate

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,150
with the systems that consume data from

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,610
them and that they're providing data to

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,080
as far as what are those interfaces look

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,690
like when did they get delivered how do

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,490
they get delivered so freedom

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:54,080
responsibility and formed captain's

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,080
highly aligned loosely coupled

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,490
I want to give a couple words about the

00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,370
organization that I personally work

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,830
inside of as well if you're a Netflix

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,659
subscriber you're familiar with the

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,629
streaming side of the company the

00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:15,849
company that streams or the DVD side

00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:18,430
that that provides content for people to

00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:20,860
watch the organization that I'm in was

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,599
formerly called the Netflix studio but

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,389
then we realized there's more to what

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,189
needs to get done then as was done by a

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:30,569
traditional studio so we had to expand

00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:33,039
the term to be content engineering and

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:35,229
the important distinction is content

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,120
engineering is involved in the process

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:39,419
of creating content that then gets

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,430
delivered on the streaming service I'm

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:46,689
in the former content engineering and I

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,219
don't know if you were paying attention

00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:49,779
but in 1918 that's when the Warner

00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:52,689
Brothers set up their studio and here it

00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:56,139
is 2018 or a hundred years later

00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:58,259
literally and if you look at all the

00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,479
technologies that we have cell phones

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:04,000
digital cameras for shooting movies

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,669
we've got surround sound all this

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,949
technology but the business of making

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:11,439
movies now versus what it was 100 years

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:14,050
ago it's still pretty much the same

00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,669
there's a ton of paper there are call

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,629
sheets where a cast and crew that show

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:18,009
up in the morning and they get this

00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,050
piece of paper that tells everybody

00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,310
where they need to be everything gets

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,319
run on clipboards with printed out

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,800
spreadsheets and the goal of content

00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,839
engineering is to design and create an

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,520
app ecosystem that enables the Netflix

00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:35,289
studio to scale as we create original

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:39,010
programming around the world ah what

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:42,490
does that even mean well to me a summary

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:44,050
is we work script to screen there's a

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,480
script that's sort of the beginning of

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,880
the content engineering process and then

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,459
ultimately it's viewed on a screen so

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,810
for shows like sandy Wexler starring

00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:56,800
Adam Sandler available streaming now on

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:58,990
netflix it's not just script to screen

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,010
but really content engineering is about

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:05,260
enabling all the stuff that goes on on

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,610
the movie credits and I know there's

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,649
some of you out there that sit in the

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,790
darkened theater like iView and you sit

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,019
there and you look at all the names this

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,950
is going up and you're looking for

00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,329
somebody named a

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,470
and then you nudge your I have to say

00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:17,139
hey there's there's another Dane up

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,250
there maybe if you have an unusual name

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,440
you don't look for Dane you look for

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,500
your name and unfortunately he was a

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,880
great name Zoltar is cut off right at

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,519
the top of the screen here you can't see

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,050
him but as all these things scroll up

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,610
there's all these people with

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,100
organizations and companies and

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,649
contractors that work together to

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,880
produce this and I don't know if you're

00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:39,339
paying attention but in this particular

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,709
set of credits there's a Yugo mechanic

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:44,709
and a Yugo manager does anyone know what

00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:47,740
a Yugo is I see a couple of hands okay

00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:50,560
so the Yugo was an economy car made in

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,329
Yugoslavia in the 1980s and imported to

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,760
North America it's sort of late 80s

00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:57,190
early 90s and it's known for its lack of

00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,459
reliability and poor build quality but

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,060
apparently mr. Sandler for his period

00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:03,399
piece

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,350
sandy Wexler said in the 1980s he wanted

00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,250
a Yugo to be part of his character and

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,589
so there's a company that provides these

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,060
vehicles as well as mechanics to make

00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:14,940
sure that when the film needs the role

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,160
that so the vehicle roles as well

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:22,720
they're part of that ecosystem that's

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,130
present in Los Angeles and a shout-out

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,720
to my coworker to Mir for pointing this

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,690
out as far as I know the Yugo was the

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,440
only car that was offered as the two and

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,050
a two-for-one deal

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,019
so back in the 80s you could buy one car

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,570
and get two for free as the credits

00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:39,720
scroll up you move from here through the

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,160
stars were and you get into things like

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,130
this shot right here from Sandy Wexler

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,810
which is all these songs every piece of

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,910
music that you hear in a movie is

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,740
licensed specifically for that show and

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,930
there's all sorts of legal and

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,070
accounting firms providing the services

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:58,300
needed to put all this stuff together

00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,589
and again the info on the credits that's

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,680
what content engineering is all about

00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:05,019
bringing technology to bear on this 100

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,970
year old set of workflows and

00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:09,959
integrations and interactions that are

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,860
memorialized in the closing credits and

00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,350
you notice there's a lot of

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:18,069
relationships potentially between shows

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,000
and vendors and there's some challenges

00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:19,890
when you're trying to bring all this

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,630
stuff together

00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,570
apart from graph QL so I want to talk

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,250
about some technical challenges

00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,050
I want to talk about some non-technical

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,590
challenges and how we can think about

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,810
approaching those successfully

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:35,330
internally at Netflix we've got a

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,860
polyglot development environment okay

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,170
Java lots of Java

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,760
we've got no js' we've got Ruby who's

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,590
you got go those are the ones I know

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,780
about there's Python people around and

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,640
other things as well and there's just a

00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,520
proliferation of micro micro services

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,290
some of them are rest some of them have

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,650
swagger documentation some of them don't

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:56,000
and there's a lot of G RPC services as

00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,310
well and I'll talk a little bit more

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,700
about G RPC as I go on for those of you

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,770
who aren't familiar with it there's to

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,780
me as someone relatively new to Netflix

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,660
a pretty impressive security

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,100
infrastructure and the Netflix security

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,570
team maintains a YouTube channel if

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,310
you're interested in security I highly

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,350
recommend you check some of their videos

00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:18,020
out but there's one piece in particular

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,790
called Metatron that as somebody working

00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,500
to integrate data from a bunch of micro

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,710
services I have to pay attention to and

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,810
that's a service to service mutual

00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,570
authentication using SSL TLS

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:32,990
certificates and then the last thing up

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:35,780
here is how do you run scalable services

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,000
in the cloud and we run all of our

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,220
applications in AWS and so you have this

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,520
idea that I need this service to scale

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:46,970
as demand ramps up and I bring new

00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:51,590
instances online how do other systems

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:53,780
resolve that because inside the AWS data

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,940
centers inside the the region's they

00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,590
don't have DNS so Netflix has a project

00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,230
called Eureka linked up here on the

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:03,670
slide to basically implement service

00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,670
discovery inside AWS

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,830
and as somebody relatively new this this

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,590
is a lot to be trying to pay attention

00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:15,470
to and I felt like man I feel like I'm

00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,540
in a boxing ring I'm trying to integrate

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,490
put a bunch of services together to

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,320
present the data out for the application

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,900
that I need feels like I got all these

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,160
jabs got a minor security issue okay

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,530
there's a good there's a client here for

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,520
the service that I want ooh but some of

00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,910
the calls that I need they're not

00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,700
implemented in my language of choice and

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,470
so just boom boom boom distracting me

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,660
from I'm trying to integrate this data

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,450
so that I can surface it to a UI for

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,920
presentation to two users I started

00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,330
asking myself can I make it so that I

00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,010
don't even have to get in the ring with

00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,560
these guys so I don't even have to deal

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,030
with those types of problems maybe I

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,580
could get to the point where all I need

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,700
is a graph QL client and then everything

00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,930
else is taken care of behind the scenes

00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,370
it's a good question but I'm gonna hold

00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,510
that thought cause I want to talk a

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,260
little bit about non-technical

00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:05,330
challenges and relating data across

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,190
domains but also how do you bring things

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,750
into an organization like I described

00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:12,980
earlier highly aligned loosely coupled

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:14,330
and form captains that any solution that

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,760
you're going to bring in it has to

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,410
support those in form captains they have

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,880
customers of their own who are going to

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,670
be using their applications and and

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,230
those people who are in LA they have

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,510
hard deadlines they have access to

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,240
talent to shoot on screen for a certain

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,740
window of time they may have access to a

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,790
shooting location for a certain period

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,690
of time they may have access to

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:38,000
equipment so anything that another

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,410
informed captain may decide to do has to

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,160
be compatible with the commitments that

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:45,530
they've already made and also just how

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,660
do i organically grow developer

00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:50,150
mindshare because one of the other talks

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:53,660
I saw is titled convincing your CTO

00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,440
about graph QL and I thought I can see

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,600
how that would work in some

00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,360
organizations but that's just not how

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,070
decisions are made within Netflix so I

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,230
got to come up with a way to win

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,380
developer mind share and as a developer

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,300
myself I agree I've got a pretty good

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:12,200
stick here I'm sorry I could pretty good

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,400
carrot move because graph QL what does

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,860
it have to offer it's got strong types

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,180
strong types are cool again tooling it's

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,610
got some really nice tools it's got

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,680
explorable API so that just blew my mind

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,750
when I first saw it and potentially I

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,850
can eliminate all of that kind of

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:31,200
language specific client integration

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,210
work back to the boxing analogy so okay

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,980
how do I go about doing this within the

00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,050
organization with the understanding of

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,820
how things work and it's not tough down

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,620
as well what are the possible approaches

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,080
and the first one seems like a of course

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,610
there's the the One Ring and we're gonna

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,230
go to the claw we're gonna we're gonna

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,570
go to the graph it's gonna be amazing

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,930
top down we're gonna have some big bang

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,920
release it's going to take us 18 months

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,980
maybe that could work it's not gonna

00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,920
work at Netflix so what are the other

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:02,010
options available to me and one of the

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,960
things as a developer at Netflix I hear

00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,150
a lot about is this people talking about

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,990
the paved road the paved road you got to

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,330
stay on the paved road

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,300
what's the paved road the paved road is

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,490
a set of practices and tools and

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,410
utilities and automation to make it

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,580
really easy to go from absolutely

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:23,160
nothing to I'm running a web application

00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:27,690
inside AWS and that's part of the larger

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,740
Netflix ecosystem so in my in my mind I

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,810
started thinking well maybe we're

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,600
blazing new trails here maybe we're out

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,520
on a horseback there's no paths but I

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,830
need to do some integration the team

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,860
that I'm on right now we're using Ruby

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:43,260
on Rails to create a graph QL schema

00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,390
that takes a bunch of data from some

00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,640
other micro services and surfaces it to

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,650
a UI that's the application that we're

00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,470
building that's my current data j

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,910
day-to-day work but i thought okay if

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,140
i'm riding through my riding with my

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,040
horse through the wilderness here

00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,780
cutting a new trail maybe i can identify

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,250
hey i see a spring there i'm gonna dig a

00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,570
well so that the next people who come

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,850
through here they can take advantage of

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,880
the work that i've already done and so

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:12,150
I'm kind of working with that analogy

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:15,089
and thinking what are hunks of data or

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,260
services that I need to expose to my

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:19,020
application that might be useful to

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,190
others sort of maybe I'm making some

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,190
graph QL micros microsoft

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,579
so the more I thought about that I

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,290
thought hey if I do this and then

00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:31,230
Garrett Heinlein is going to speak

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,120
tomorrow his team is doing this maybe

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,290
there's another team and if we could put

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,450
them all together and it would be

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,309
something totally awesome like Voltron

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,620
right for those of you not familiar with

00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:42,090
Voltron it's this kids cartoon where

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,890
there's these giant robots and they all

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,830
go together to form an even bigger and

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,210
more powerful robot called Voltron but

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,110
then I thought it all turns only got

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:54,690
five lions that make up the bigger

00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,340
bigger robot and we've got thousands of

00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,340
micro swords of micro-services for

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,250
shirts and if I took a step back as an

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,530
API developer I've got my data that's

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,270
graph GL enabled there's another team

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,100
there's another team now I can start

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,670
linking in together and thinking about

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,710
it that way

00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:14,160
and then of course that made me think of

00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,240
bacon but not this bacon the game six

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,130
degrees of Kevin Bacon

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,929
I thought Netflix is actually trying to

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,730
do some of this stuff if you're not

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:22,650
familiar with the game it's you try and

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,000
go from Kevin Bacon to another actor by

00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,429
connecting them with movies that they've

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,200
all been in and I thought we need to do

00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:34,559
a lot of this types of type of thing and

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:36,450
you probably have data objects in your

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,110
business that you're thinking about and

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:43,760
things that are linked together so now

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,760
we're not necessarily talking about

00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,960
about just data by itself but we're

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:52,200
talking about networks and networks have

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,179
network effects most engineers have

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,220
heard of this but the value of a network

00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:59,429
is the square of the number of nodes so

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,920
if I have never worked with one node the

00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:05,580
value is one if I have a network of two

00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,929
values for of three nine four sixteen we

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,840
know this about telephone networks we

00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:11,130
know this about data networks I know

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,410
this about transportation networks all

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:17,280
this makes sense but are we thinking

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:19,200
about networks of data points not data

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,150
transport networks not the wires that

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,320
carry the ones and zeros but individual

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:29,970
data objects and I believe graph QL

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:32,850
enables network effects for our data the

00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,059
more nodes the more entities more data

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,529
objects that we are participating

00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:38,720
network the more valuable that network

00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:41,480
is going to become and back to the

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,759
carrot at some point the network is so

00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,499
valuable that as new applications are

00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,019
developed or new services come online to

00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:49,879
not be part of that network it's just

00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:52,039
unthinkable because the costs that you

00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:54,440
would bear are so great

00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:56,509
of course you hook up to the network so

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,509
going back to my horseback-riding

00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:01,789
analogy again we're creating this

00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:04,850
graphical schema and trying to as much

00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:07,279
as possible expose services that we need

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:12,350
in a way that are useful for others in

00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:14,059
the future that we think might be from

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:19,070
an implementation standpoint what do

00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:21,379
things look like for us there's a number

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,940
of different concrete technical paths

00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:24,830
that you could take one of the things we

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,899
looked at I mentioned before we have

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,710
swagger documented restful services so

00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:34,190
swagger if you're not familiar with it

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,389
swagger do you can go there and find out

00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,269
about it but it's basically an API

00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:40,759
specification and so somebody on github

00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:43,369
named dr axe has this swagger to graph

00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:45,499
QL translator it's pretty amazing but I

00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:46,999
had to get at Metatron enabled once I

00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:50,149
did that I realized your mileage really

00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:52,340
varies as far as the quality of the

00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:53,809
swagger API documentation if it's not

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,210
very good you're not going to get good

00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:57,769
results so that didn't work for us very

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,200
well the second thing we looked at was

00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:02,090
database servers like post graph file

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,059
and shout out to Benji Gilliam from the

00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:07,490
UK I think he's here and it's a

00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:08,600
fantastic piece of software I highly

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,480
recommend you take a look at it but

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,869
unfortunately because my team is taking

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,830
data from a bunch of Micra services and

00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:17,779
presenting it out it wasn't a good fit

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,429
for us we didn't have a big data store

00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,720
we were trying to expose obviously

00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:22,580
bespoke approaches that's what we're

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,210
doing using the graph QL rubygem and

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,990
there hasn't been a good solve for G RPC

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,340
services

00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:33,649
I haven't been aware of one until now so

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:37,039
I'd like to introduce the graph QL G RPC

00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:40,690
rubygem and what it can be used for is

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:43,009
to easily take a G RPC service and

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,169
generate a graph QL schema from it that

00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:47,060
then you can make queries and mutation

00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:49,500
calls in

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,750
for those of you not familiar with G RPC

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,090
it's a it's a remote procedure call

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,920
system and it has an interface

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,470
definition language or IDL called

00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,750
protobufs and the idea is as a developer

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,610
you go in and you say here's all the

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,070
different calls that can be made to my

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,570
system here's the names here's the

00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,130
arguments that can get past them with

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,340
their types and the types that you get

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:13,260
back and you do that in this generic IDL

00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,880
and then you run a compiler and it spits

00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:20,250
out stubs in your language of choice and

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,410
G RPC strongly typed so it's graph QL

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:25,050
hey maybe we can write something that

00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:28,530
translates between the two so credit to

00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:31,860
Zane clays at Airbnb he wrote some code

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,420
that proxies requests to G RPC from

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,270
graph QL so you make a call to graph QL

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,100
this code turns it into a gr PC call you

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,590
get the results back he turns it from G

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,080
RPC to graph QL back to the client

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,850
he wrote the original code kind of gave

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,530
me the idea but all the schema

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,660
generation code wasn't there so I wrote

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,250
that worked with Zane to package it up

00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,260
into this ruby gem it's very alpha

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:55,080
quality and it currently supports

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,520
queries and now supports basic mutations

00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,370
and yes

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,590
Zane and Dane worked on this I didn't

00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,550
make that up there's a few gotchas that

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,710
you should be aware of if you're

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,800
thinking about using this input types

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,600
versus output types G RPC you can

00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,190
provide the same type as an input and

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,300
get it back as an output maybe you

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,270
didn't know this you can't do that in

00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,880
graph QL you can have type collisions

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,470
there's some named collision issues

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,870
there's not really a good story for how

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,320
do you name space separate services as

00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:27,630
part of a larger schema and then there's

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,430
the hash as dictionaries hashmaps within

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,100
graph QL there's a very long discussion

00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:33,990
on github that you can find the current

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,930
code as implemented right now a few gem

00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,160
install graph qlg RPC it will do what

00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:41,310
you see up on the screen on the last

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,260
line there if a.g RPC call is returning

00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:45,540
a hash map that has integers as the keys

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:49,560
it'll turn that into an array where each

00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:52,340
object is has a key in value field so

00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,910
I'm going to do a quick demo here and

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,770
let's see

00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,770
it says video can't be loaded

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,190
our brother

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,480
this

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,220
bear with me here please I'm sorry this

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,380
this was all set up before I got up here

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,380
but apparently my session timed out so

00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:23,160
what I'm going to show here is this a

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:25,530
Ruby on Rails application using using

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:29,930
the graph geology RPC Gian gem to talk

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,930
to an actual service that we have

00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,559
okay now let me pause it

00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:53,080
okay good apologies for the technical

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,730
difficulty so here we have graphical

00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,440
running on the right hand side this

00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,730
whole schema was all generated by the

00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,980
gem I didn't have to do anything myself

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,870
I just pointed it at the client and then

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,090
on the left hand side here I'm actually

00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,980
running a query boom and get the results

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,770
back and stroll through it there's

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,780
really no additional latency on the

00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,520
right hand side here I just want to

00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,740
point out I don't know if you can see

00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,510
this but each of the input types is

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,429
prefixed with an i underscore and that

00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,809
was the current way that I'm handling

00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:22,289
the fact that you can have the same type

00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:26,350
in G RPC that's a request in a response

00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:28,240
so the other thing because this is

00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,970
generating a valid graph GL schema you

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,100
get all the benefits of tooling which is

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,600
super amazing and I was speaking with a

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,159
co-worker he says hey can you rename a

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,340
field and I tried it out and work the

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:47,380
first time it's pretty fascinating so

00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:49,929
that's my demo look look that's the demo

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,280
I wanted to make everyone aware of it

00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:52,780
it's a tool in the toolkit it's not

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,120
necessarily hey this is the perfect

00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:58,840
solution but it allows you to bootstrap

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,840
G RPC data and resources into a larger

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,390
graph QL based data network and feedback

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,370
and PRS totally welcomed love to get

00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,679
people's thoughts on this I'm going to

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,960
be around today and tomorrow we'd love

00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,850
to have discussed this with with others

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,929
and my team at Netflix is hiring so

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,789
there's a number of us walking around

00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:17,169
from Netflix we'd love to talk to you as

00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:18,400
well so thanks for your time and

00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,510
attention appreciate it have a great

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,170
afternoon

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:25,170
