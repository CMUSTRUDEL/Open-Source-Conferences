Description: 
	A good state management library should have the ability to manage side effects, transform data, and update state. Apollo client 3 has all of that but where does that stand with Redux? If you were also a skeptic then you will enjoy this talk as Ankita takes you through her journey of adopting and scaling Apollo client for state management.

 In this talk, Ankita will draw comparisons with Redux and Context and walk you through how an e-commerce application has adopted it and scaled it.

Key takeaways:
* How hooks allowed the team to remove redux actions
* Use local-only fields and type policies to manage all client data in one place
* How to use reactive variables for authentication
