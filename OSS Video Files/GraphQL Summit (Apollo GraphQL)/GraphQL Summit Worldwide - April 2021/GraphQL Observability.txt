Publication date: 2021-04-13
Playlist: GraphQL Summit Worldwide - April 2021
Description: 
	GraphQL is an immensely powerful tool and while there are tons of resources out there on how to leverage it, there doesn't seem to be much open discussion around Day 2 (maintenance in production) operations of GraphQL. 

In this talk, we'll be focusing on applying OpenTelemetry to federated GraphQL services to empower teams through observability.

Key takeaways:
* How observability works and why you need it
* Using Open Telemetry in Apollo Server
* Using Open Telemetry in a Federated Graph
