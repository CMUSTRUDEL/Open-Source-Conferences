hello hello hello and welcome to graphql

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,839

welcome from california west coaster

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,239
monica is here in the lower left hand

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,239
corner how are you monica

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,600
wow and carolyn how's it going

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,360
it's good how are you i'm great

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,359
i love that everyone is waving i think

00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,920
we should be normalizing waving into the

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,160
camera

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,440
we should have fun and wave as much as

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
we want in these zooms

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,799
so we shouldn't feel bad about that

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,760
so i'm really excited to be here today

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,600
all of these people

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,520
are incredible software engineers but

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,200
they're also teachers they're

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,640
constantly sharing what they know and

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,119
i'm really excited to learn from them

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,400
today

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,200
so the reason we are all here today is

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,119
to

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,439
kind of talk about the process of

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,000
learning graphql what's worked for these

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,960
panelists

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,680
who have done it what hasn't worked um

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,159
and

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,720
if you're in the audience on the stream

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,040
and you're

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,920
a graphql super expert and you're

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,479
thinking

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,000
i already learned graphql this is in my

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,399
past

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,439
maybe some things that we discuss can

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,520
help you onboard

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,119
others to work with graphql successfully

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
so that they love it and they want to

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,840
use it for every project

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,040
so with all of that being said let's go

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
ahead and jump into it

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,640
so i want to take us way back let's

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,079
think way back

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,799
to when we learned graphql in the first

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,439
place

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
when we began our journey with graphql

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,320
what were

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,080
what was it like to learn graphql what

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,959
was like your first week learning

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
graphql like and what types of tools did

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,160
you use

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,280
i'm going to start with anybody want to

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,680
jump in

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,920
i'll pick on you but i'll let you do it

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,840
yeah hit it kate

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,840
um so for me personally i guess like the

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,239
first week or two learning graphql has

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,560
been

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,000
familiarizing myself with the tools and

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
like the very basics

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
i personally kind of started on the

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,800
server side and decided to

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,280
um specialize specifically in like um

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,920
graphql plus node and typescript

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,000
so um for example one of the things that

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,560
i've been specifically figuring out how

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,040
to do

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,000
for a few hours like i don't know like

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,800
two weeks ago

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,519
was how to break down a singular schema

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,519
into a more

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,000
modularized solution so for example

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,160
every object type like user or card or

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
product then would be able to have its

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,400
own schema and it's all

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,280
like its own resolver definitions so

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
then i also

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,280
um decided to use graphql code jan

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,840
because it would allow

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,680
to generate typescript types so that i

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,720
wouldn't have to like really find

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
um already what i have in my schemas and

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
then

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,599
basically it turns out that apollo

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,120
server allows multiple type definitions

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,920
for resolvers as well as the graphql

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,599
type

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,560
sorry graphql code gen allows to accept

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,920
like multiple schemas so that's kind of

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,360
a fun thing that i did

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,760
some time ago that's awesome

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,599
how about you prince what was it like

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,640
learning graphql

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,560
yeah uh coming from like just learn

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,560
like just building with ruby on rails

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,200
and like restful architecture i was like

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
why would i ever want to use graphql but

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,040
then i was like wait let me take a step

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,159
back

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,920
let me let me actually like um see it

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,239
and look at how it works and i actually

00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,480
was pretty impressed i started with the

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,000
just reading about the the graphql.com

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,439
site and going through and kind of

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,159
getting like my literature around from

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,640
there

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,760
and then also going and starting through

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
the apollo work

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,720
that's there and just kind of playing

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,159
around and building my own toy app and i

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,599
think that's like my learning process

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,200
it's just like starting to build with

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,720
something and then seeing like what do

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,000
these fancies words mean

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,000
because i don't really understand

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,080
what are all of these graphql words

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
totally

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,479
um monica how about you what was your

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,639
journey like with learning graphql

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,840
yes um so i would say for my journey of

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,080
learning graphql

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,160
um originally i kind of learned it or

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,000
started telling it by accident so i was

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,120
um using gatsby js

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
which is a react framework um for a side

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
project and

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,840
all of the data management by default

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,400
uses graphql

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,840
um so as soon as i started there were

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,919
like already queries

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,840
like pulling in data and i had to kind

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,120
of understand like what was happening at

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,680
least

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,320
at a minimum level to to like edit the

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,160
pages

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,639
or to change what information is being

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,960
pulled in um so that was like my first

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,960
exposure i'm using graphql more so like

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,240
as a consumer and also

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,320
um more so writing queries and then um

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,520
as i got more familiar with like how the

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,280
data was working

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,800
uh how the data was being pulled in i

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,600
was able to then um

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,479
like write mutation or resolvers um but

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,240
it definitely

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,840
for me it started off just like needing

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
to understand like how to actually query

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,840
the information

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,000
um so that was kind of how i fell into

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,120
starting to learn graphic as well

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,080
totally yeah gatsby throws you into the

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,680
graphql snake pit really fast and i

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,800
think it's so cool that it's based on

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,400
that because i think

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,080
more and more people will be using

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,199
graphql because it is

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,000
baked into gatsby so that's awesome

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,800
hey carolyn how about you what about

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,720
your

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,039
start so i first learned graphql as part

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,520
of

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
a job interview process back when i was

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,280
a technical writer

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
so i was asked to build an app with

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,759
graphql

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,639
apollo and react kind of new react

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,319
didn't know graphql or apollo so and i

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,199
had also had to write a tutorial

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,919
on that app so i have a lot of opinions

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,520
about

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,479
having that big of a chunk in your job

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,400
interview process but

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
i was mostly just focused on throwing

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,039
together it was like an image board

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,400
that showed pictures of baby hippos so i

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,160
was really focused on throwing it

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,160
together and i didn't really

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,759
learn what i was doing like i had built

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,759
an app but i hadn't

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,520
like with graphql but i didn't i

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,800
couldn't have ever really explained how

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,919
or why

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,560
so i didn't really get it until later i

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,120
had a job

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,840
where i was given the time to really

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
revisit

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,840
and learn the fundamentals so my first

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,080
two weeks were a little

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,160
hectic i would say yeah totally

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,680
what types of learning resources when

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,240
you were first learning did you reach

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,919
for i know

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,000
prince you said the docs were there any

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,840
other like tutorials or things that you

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,240
found useful

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
um i personally really enjoyed using how

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,520
to graphql.com

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,280
they have a serious tutorials on both

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,960
the client and server side and

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,400
it was essentially originally developed

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,639
by the prisma team but then

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,840
kind of picked up by the overall open

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,240
source community

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,680
and like i believe they have like like

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,680
node and elixir and

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
ruby and java and python and whatever

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
like whatever languages you can think of

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,199
and i think that's kind of pretty cool

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,560
and i believe like because it's open

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,440
source i think

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,759
um it's gonna probably stay up to date

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,280
with the new graphql features and as

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,280
crackheel moves forward

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,560
as well as i hope that if somebody like

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
stumbles upon something and doesn't

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,199
understand

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,880
something from the first time and like

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,720
do their research and figure it out

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
that they would be able to then kind of

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,680
contribute for

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,919
the overall good of like everybody else

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,400
yeah how to graphql.com how to

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,080
graphql.com how to graphql.com

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,919
if you haven't checked out that site

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,479
before it's really awesome and

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,360
you should definitely get in there if

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,879
you're looking to

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,720
learn anything about graphql and as you

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,120
said like for any platform really

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
because

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
the thing about the graphql that's kind

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,960
of cool is that you don't have to be

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,639
necessarily a javascript engineer any

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,680
certain type of engineer to really

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,160
benefit from it

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,280
so um what other learning resources

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,440
anybody have a

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,879
favorite that was useful as you're

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,840
learning stuff

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,840
oh my gosh i do

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,240
it's easy oh no

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,199
i promise she didn't pay me but really

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,279
this book was

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,279
really helpful every time i'm on a team

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,719
that needs to learn graphql for a new

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,760
project i usually order it for the

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,880
library

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,240
in the office or yeah i think it's a

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,919
really good fundamentals especially

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,440
because it's detached from

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,360
specific programming languages

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,880
necessarily so you really get down to

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,080
those like root concepts and

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,120
fundamentals

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,000
i also really like apollo's graphql

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,760
glossary

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,200
to address exactly what prince was

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
talking about this

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,880
issue with all of these terminologies

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,880
that's really

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,240
hard to keep track of and hard to figure

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,399
out what

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,360
like what does sdl really mean took me

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,399
forever to figure that out

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,000
for sure yeah

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,360
that's very funny that you had that prop

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,080
available at your disposal

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,560
you're very prepared love it

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,080
[Laughter]

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,600
uh who else what other learning

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,120
resources have you been

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,959
have you enjoyed using um well i was on

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,480
echo about how to learn graphql i really

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,760
liked the interactivity within the

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,839
documentation

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,600
um and then also like really like

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,120
exploring i feel like taking advantage

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,120
of the fact that you can explore

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,760
um the graphical schema like within the

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,000
different um like graphql playgrounds

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,440
um i think was for me very helpful for

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,120
me to like really actually understand

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,959
like how to write queries

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
and like making sure that i can see like

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,279
in real time

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,959
um what data was being returned um

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,399
it took it took me i would say longer

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,600
than i want to admit to find out that

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,120
there was like the

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,200
graphical was embedded in um gatsby

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,880
um so yeah i definitely urge people to

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
like really just like explore and get to

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,480
know

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,040
um the schema like not necessarily just

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,519
like

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,240
um how it looks like in the code but

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,760
also when you're

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,519
writing the queries and like what is the

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,519
data that's being returned look like and

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,200
not being afraid to really dive into

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,120
that

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
totally can you imagine not having

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,720
graphical or the graphql playground to

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,480
work with graphql

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,279
it would be a very different world a

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
sadder world a less enjoyable world i

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,800
think

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,720
definitely um are there any of those

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,360
playgrounds like public ones that

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,160
you use to play around with data i know

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,399
there's the

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,880
star wars api which is like the rule you

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,079
have to use that one at some point

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,519
eventually but are there others um i've

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,279
used like github there

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,360
they have two apis so they have a rest

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,440
api and a graphql api and for the

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,240
graphql one you can like authenticate as

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
yourself

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,079
um and then write queries within the in

00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,200
the browser so i

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,800
thought that was cool for me because

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,920
there were like some ideas i had and i

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,079
just quickly wanted to

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,920
understand like does it seem like these

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,640
methods are actually exposed in the api

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,480
or not

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
um and it got me it got me to like be

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,200
able to kind of like

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,680
do a little bit of rough like

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,680
prototyping without actually having to

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,839
like set up the api locally so i thought

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,120
that was pretty cool

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,800
yeah totally um yeah the github api if

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
you're learning graphql is something

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
really

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,959
to i'd encourage you to check out just

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,120
because you can

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,560
play with all of your live data which is

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,600
wild you can

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,200
send pull requests through the github

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
explorer if you really want to

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,120
take too long to do that things like

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,519
that but it's very fun

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,920
all right uh so what was the most

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,760
challenging part of learning graphql

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,079
i skipped over prince on the last

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,440
question so i'll start with you here

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,920
i think uh to to the point i made before

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,320
it's just

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,279
a lot of the language i think one uh

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,680
specifically like

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,200
the terminology that is used as well as

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
like what are the kind of different

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,839
options that you can use like

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,639
at first the course that i used was um

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
like westboss's advanced react and

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,200
graphql

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
course which happened to go through

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,079
prisma at the time

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,839
um and yoga and i was like wait but why

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,200
well why not apollo server and just like

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,760
knowing that there's all these different

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,360
options

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,800
and like what those options mean and

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,000
like what's the kind of like drawbacks

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,200
to those and that was kind of

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
the part that i struggled the most with

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,240
is figuring out what what's like the

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,120
right approach or is there like a kind

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,320
of pathway that i should be taking

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,360
yeah yeah carolyn sorry

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,360
yeah please oh um i guess i just wanted

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,600
to uh go off off what brings add

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,200
and the fact that it's hard to know

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,279
where to start as well

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,560
so like uh prince chose to start with

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,560
west boston scores but

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,959
they're like countless talks countless

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,720
articles countless like video tutorials

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,480
it might be kind of difficult mentally

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
to figure out where to start

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
and i think the best advice that i can

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,920
give here is pick a specific tech stack

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,120
and pick a specific like type of

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,240
architecture that you perhaps are

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,279
familiar with

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,959
and start like loose and then go from

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:09,440
there expand your knowledge from there

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,399
yeah i love that that's great it's funny

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,800
because

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,200
like i said before there is not one way

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,600
to do graphql there's a lot of cool

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,839
ways of getting started so i think

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,639
picking a stack is really important or

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,880
you start to

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,240
like drown in the sea of options you

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,120
know so

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,639
uh monica are there any challenges that

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,920
you ran into when you're learning

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,680
graphql

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,920
um yeah i would definitely say like when

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,959
writing um for example when writing

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,360
resolvers

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,800
like really understanding um i guess

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,480
like what are the conventions like what

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
are the best practices as to like how

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,680
you should

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720
um handle mutations and things like that

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,880
um since there

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,720
is like a shift between like how the

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,360
graphql way to do things and the the

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,600
rest way to

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,120
think the rightful way to do things um

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,959
so i would i guess echo what

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,240
others were saying as to like really

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,680
understanding like the

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,120
the conventions and um like what are

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,720
some of the drawbacks to like different

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,360
approaches

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,360
as to how you handle um dna and graphql

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,199
since there is like a lot of flexibility

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,279
um but not everything necessarily like

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,360
scales or um

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,720
and things like that so um for me that

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,600
was like the most challenging part of

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,000
just like

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,360
really trying to learn like the graphql

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,440
way of doing things versus

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:26,560
necessarily like how to get it working

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,279
yeah for sure there's no

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,639
one right way to do it so that always

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,639
makes things tough

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,079
um carolyn do you have anything on that

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,720
like what was challenging for you when

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,000
you were

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,000
getting started yeah so i'm primarily a

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,839
front-end developer so i think

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,120
when i first got started it was hard to

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,279
figure out like where to go

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,399
as someone who is pretty much only front

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,160
end so

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,079
i would get part way through a tutorial

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,279
and then i'd be like whoa scary back-end

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,320
stuff like

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,839
i'm just gonna put that over there so i

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,120
was really intimidated by a lot of the

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,199
things i was running into

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,320
um so i'll throw in another like

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,560
learning resource

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,079
that really helped me was peggy raises

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,079
has a guide called a front-end

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,519
developer's guide to graphql

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,120
and it kind of walks through how you use

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,399
graphql on the front end and different

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,480
examples

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,680
of you know client libraries and things

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,680
like that so

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,600
i found it really helpful maybe we'll

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,760
have someone else

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,600
yeah totally that's a great one uh

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,240
someone was mentioning in the chat too

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,760
there's the spacex api that's a good one

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,000
to get started with that's kind of from

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,880
an

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,880
earlier question but that's a fun one to

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,279
if you're looking for some data to ask

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,560
for

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:38,320
you can ask for it from there so

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:41,279
there is a huge ecosystem of all these

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,320
graphql tools out there that exist so

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,079
what's next

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,440
for you what are you excited to learn

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,440
about next

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,440
and i'll be a teacher and i'll stare

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,639
yeah

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,320
go for it um so for me personally i'm

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,720
gonna guilty i'm gonna be super guilty

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,680
of it

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,839
testing um i haven't exactly learned

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,759
neither unit or integration testing

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,680
whether i'm fronted or on the back end

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,040
and had to do it with graphql

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,120
as well as how to secure graphql apis

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,079
either with authentication or like

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,560
protecting it from

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,560
potential malicious attacks like guilty

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,480
that's great yeah those are those are

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
both great ones what about you carolyn

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,320
yeah i was actually also going to say

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,079
testing so that's great

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,600
i think it's really you know it's

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,680
something that i found really important

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,440
um through like my own developer journey

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,000
and this idea of like testing

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,199
graphql apis and how do we do it

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,360
especially things like

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,680
how can we use like graphql's built-in

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,959
type safety and introspection to help us

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,839
write like accurate predictive tests

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,759
so yeah and how also uh how it plays

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,680
into the whole ecosystem of like test

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,839
driven development or property based

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,600
testing like i don't know i find it

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,639
really fascinating just based on the way

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,720
graphql is

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,079
inherently structured totally

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,439
prince what about you what are you

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,559
excited about in the world of graphql

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,679
i don't know uh as i i feel like there's

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,199
just always constantly

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,480
things that are happening uh that i

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,919
haven't actually kept up with i haven't

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,600
kept up with federation

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,039
uh and like what that actually looks

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,880
like one of the things

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,240
the last things i really looked at was

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,679
specifically with like apollo engine

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,480
like just understanding more of like how

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,640
do we get that

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,679
that um that information about what are

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,039
things that are going wrong

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,280
like learning a little bit more about

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,520
like the kind of metrics that are going

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,120
on

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,480
i think kind of kind of spending more

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,440
time in there is what i'm really

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,440
interested in learning more about

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,320
just meeting myself and drinking coffee

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,880
during that um that's wonderful

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,240
i think yeah it's like how you've

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,799
learned graphql

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,720
right and then you're not ever done so

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,559
that's with programming or with anything

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,240
there's this like there's always new

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,799
stuff coming out that you have to evolve

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
and

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,080
learn so having strategies for dealing

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,679
with that is great

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,320
how about you monica anything you're

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,120
looking to pick up next

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,080
um i really want to dive into um

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
creating a

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,559
gas resource plug-in so in gatsby a

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,520
source plug-in is how you can pull data

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,240
into your gatsby site from a third party

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,480
um so i've definitely taken advantage of

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,559
writing more like local ways of like

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,120
sourcing data um and also using

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,600
other people's um source plugins um but

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
i'm really

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,640
interested in figuring out if there's

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,440
like something that can contribute back

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,320
to the

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,760
um gatsby ecosystem that would involve

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,640
like writing graphql

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,760
and allowing other people to consume

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,679
that

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,039
that data um using what i created so

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,480
that's something i'm interested

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,480
in exploring soon that's awesome

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,799
that's really cool yeah i think there's

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,160
so many cool directions you can go in

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,039
with that stuff but

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,000
gatsby and graphql is obviously so

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,760
interesting and

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,600
if you're looking for resources on that

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,799
monica writes awesome blogs about that

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,919
stuff so you should definitely

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,280
check it out check it out um

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,080
so we've kind of touched on this a

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,640
little bit throughout but are there

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,400
if if you could go back in time and give

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,600
yourself one piece of advice

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,440
about graphql if you could

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,880
sit down with yourself where you're like

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,919
pulling your hair out

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,480
trying to do something with graphql

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:25,840
i didn't rearrange that well um what

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,840
would you say what advice would you give

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,280
i'll start with you monica um what

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,880
advice would i give myself

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,559
um that's a good question i mean i think

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,080
probably just like really making sure

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,960
that i understand the documents as

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,760
opposed to

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,480
like trying to apply what i know from

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,919
other

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,280
other languages uh to to graphql um

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,480
because there are definitely a lot of

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,520
things like syntax

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,679
specific to graphql um so i would say

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,880
like leaning on some documentation and

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,240
i'm just making sure that i like

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,720
thoroughly understand

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,520
um before like diving in because i feel

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,360
like there's like

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,640
a certain amount of depth you can get

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,280
into without like

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
really understanding graphql and then um

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,200
it can get really

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,520
hairy so um i think that would be my

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,640
recommendation read the docs um yeah

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,559
yeah nice how about you kate

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,000
um so for me i think it might be kind of

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,919
slightly opposite of that

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
just because i personally learned best

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,039
from kind of hands-on experience in

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
practice

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,200
so for me would be probably like an

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,799
advice to take breaks make sure you're

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,039
staying hydrated make sure you

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,120
don't get yourself too overwhelmed with

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,679
amount of resources and knowledge out

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,320
there

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,679
and people who are like experts already

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,679
in the field and you're just like

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,960
starting out to learn graphql and you're

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,720
not familiar with it

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,799
like there are people especially

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,840
sometimes on twitter sometimes

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,159
um who will be happy to help and happy

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,559
to offer their expertise and kind of

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,159
like

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,880
their training and their knowledge on

00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:00,159
graphql if you ask about it

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,039
um but yeah take breaks make sure you're

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,960
taking small

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,720
steps every single day towards

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
improvements maybe like read one article

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,440
a day

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,960
but also make sure that you are somehow

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,799
um taking all of that knowledge that you

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,280
gather and put it into practice like

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,360
into

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,720
either one person project that like i've

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,280
been doing i've been actually

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,080
building sort of an e-commerce art store

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,600
on the side

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,240
and building an api with that with

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,919
graphql and like milton typescript

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,440
and i've been essentially taking all of

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,360
that server-side knowledge that i've

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,120
took and put it into a single project

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,799
but i know that other people prefer kind

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,559
of to separate it into

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,240
various projects yeah totally that

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,720
sounds like great advice for

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,559
learning anything i feel like is just

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,120
working a little bit at it every single

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,000
day

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,880
i sometimes feel like i want to learn

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,280
something and then i

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,880
take a whole day to learn something and

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,880
then i'm like i can't commit that much

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,600
time to that ever again that's one day

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,039
i'm never going to go back to it so yeah

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,159
just moving the ball forward a little

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,280
bit every day

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,840
is an awesome tip i'm gonna try to

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,720
get a little like video of that later

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,159
kate so i can

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,919
play it for myself every day and

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,840
remember that stuff

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,600
how about you prince what advice would

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,280
you give yourself or to other people

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,440
learning graphql

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,360
i i definitely think with both of the

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,080
pieces of advice is like you know

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,679
getting that terminology and that all of

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,280
the things down is really

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,640
key i think just to understanding the

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,919
building blocks and i'm a person like

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,480
visually needs to see like how does

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,000
everything

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,320
connect together it's like what does the

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,760
term mean when i see it in like code

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,679
i think it's easy to say something and

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,320
be like ah this is

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,440
this clearly is a resolver of course

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
like

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,000
but like that's that doesn't necessarily

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,520
make sense and when you see it in a

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,039
different context how do you like apply

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,640
that piece of knowledge so that's why i

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,799
like the blend of taking like

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,240
the documents that we're learning and

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,919
then also putting it into practice and

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,520
getting that feedback about like

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960
what would you do in this scenario

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,600
because i think that's where sometimes i

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,840
trip myself

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,440
is i will like learn something i'll be

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,679
like oh let me just apply it

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,120
broad stroke as opposed to recognizing

00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,919
how does it solve this particular

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,559
problem

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,159
and are there alternative solutions one

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,240
of the things about like the

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,280
docs that i found really fascinating was

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,120
pagination and like

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,320
how graphql kind of like allows us to

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,400
think about pagination slightly

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,200
differently and i was like how do you

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,720
know which one to choose uh and getting

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,640
tenant to explore that is really

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,840
important

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,400
totally that's great how about you

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,679
carolyn

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,240
what advice would you give yeah yeah

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,520
so one is that graphql is not a

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,000
programming language to make

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,159
charts it's not the same as d3 i wish

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,360
someone would have told me that like

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,320
would have saved me a lot of sadness and

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,559
stress

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,600
so i'm just gonna like put that one into

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,520
the universe

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,520
and then the second one at the risk of

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,799
sounding like i'm obsessed with you

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,799
eve i learned from you

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,200
which is to learn the query language and

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,720
the schema definition language before

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,120
diving into tools

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,520
like learning those fundamentals because

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,880
sometimes when you're working with tools

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,960
at least i found that it can be

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,320
difficult to separate those core graphql

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,640
concepts from

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,400
the nuances or intricacies of that

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,600
specific tool

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,120
so yeah that would be fun

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,520
yeah totally well thank you for the

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,679
shout out but yeah i i agree with myself

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,520
that you should learn the query language

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,559
and the schema definition language first

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,080
if you can

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,320
because i think that brings a lot of

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,279
people into graphql

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,320
who might feel like it's not for them or

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,320
it's not

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,000
um they're they might not be developers

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,760
and they want to but there's still

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,679
tons of people who need to get data

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,400
right and graphql gives us this really

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,440
nice

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,799
repeatable way of handling that so

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,279
um that is me grinding my axe about

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,320
fundamentals so i will stop talking

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,400
and i will ask another question

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,159
are there any graphql projects that

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,440
you're working on right now that

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,000
you can talk about not secret projects

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,679
public fun projects that you would like

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,840
to

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,840
share

00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,720
[Music]

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,240
um so i'm building i'm trying to learn

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,840
python right now so

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,520
i'm building next a sanrio api

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,520
so that's like you know the company

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,000
behind hello kitty and friends

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,159
so i'm trying to figure out how to build

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,760
graphql apis with python

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,559
i'm thinking i've been trying to figure

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,720
out the graphene python library

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,559
but i'm also open to other ones so if

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,080
anyone out there is like a

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,400
you know proficient in python and

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,559
graphql and has tips i would

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,080
love to hear it selfish selfish

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,559
not selfish at all that's what the

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,480
community is for for having people

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,799
do your work for you um anybody else

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,919
uh kate are you working on any graphql

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,520
things

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,120
oh yeah um like i mentioned i'm

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,679
currently working on kind of like an

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,440
e-commerce api for an ad store that i

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,640
think would be helpful for the community

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,600
in like multiple ways

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,120
first of all it can provide that api for

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,440
people who are just learning to front

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,240
like how to front end or just learning

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,640
how to build

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,640
like beautiful interfaces and on the

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,360
other hand it can also provide

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,720
sort of a reference of how to use

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,919
graphql code jan

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,720
and typescript and like just graphql as

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,520
a whole

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,240
and just use it as a reference point for

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,159
either

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,440
adopting it in production or for other

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,600
personal projects

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,559
and i hope that um when i'm gonna be

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,480
kind of closer

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,000
to publishing it right now i haven't

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,480
really connected a database

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,440
to it although the rest of the structure

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,600
is ready

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,360
i just haven't exactly particularly had

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,360
time with job searching and such

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,120
to dive deeper into how like the best

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,679
practices of connecting databases there

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,520
i know it's

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,520
database agnostic but i'm still sure

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,159
there's like a ton of information out

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,360
there

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,200
on like the best way of doing it so um i

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,400
just hope that when i'm gonna publish it

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,159
um somebody more experienced um somebody

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,400
with more experience in graphql

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,320
if they see it then they wouldn't

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,840
necessarily judge me for

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,000
the way that i wrote code and instead

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,720
would use it as a way to like

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,720
provide mentorship and like perhaps like

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,480
do a pull request to

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,799
with like certain improvements whether

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,120
it's like faster

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,159
like response time or something like

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,080
that because

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,240
i do believe that it's okay to make

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,799
mistakes and it's okay to learn and i

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,880
think

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,480
that bringing other people up and

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,600
sharing your knowledge with other people

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,600
is kind of the best way to go

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,880
totally that's great and yeah anyone

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,799
who's listening right now

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,520
kate um you have to help kate out with

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,679
that so

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,120
mentors need to step up and help her out

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,760
with that project because it sounds

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,279
awesome

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,679
monica we picked on you a little bit

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,039
earlier about gatsby stuff is there

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,640
i don't want to put you on the spot for

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,720
more projects because that's already a

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,760
lot is that mainly where your focus is

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,520
or yeah so i would say

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,200
um creating a gas view source plug-in

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,559
and definitely something that i wanted

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,520
to pick up soon um i had like

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,960
in recently made a website of um my

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,720
favorite website so it has like

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
screenshots of all these different um

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,679
websites that i like

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,159
just kind of bookmark um for inspiration

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,559
um so i had i wrote that with next and

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,000
it has a graphql api it's not like super

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,679
sophisticated of graphql

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,520
so i kind of want to like revisit it and
