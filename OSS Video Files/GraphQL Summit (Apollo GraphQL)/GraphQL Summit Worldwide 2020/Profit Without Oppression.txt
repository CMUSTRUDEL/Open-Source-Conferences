00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,520
everyone

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,640
my name is kim creighton and i want to

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,960
start with this

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
slide because as a person who's

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,680
finishing up my doctorates of business

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,160
administration

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,840
focusing on technology entrepreneurship

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,400
my area of expertise

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,920
is how to effectively share

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
organizational knowledge

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,000
for competitive advantage

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,480
differentiation and innovation

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,360
and also the school that i'm attending

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,920
um

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,480
one of their founding tenants is social

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,480
change

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,920
so working to better foster social

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,399
change through research

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,680
practice and the education of motivated

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,840
scholar practitioners

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
i am a scholar practitioner i take

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,840
research in theory and i pr

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,399
um test it and practice it in the real

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,440
world we are

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,520
no longer creating widgets

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,920
business leaders must learn to operate

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,400
in an information economy

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,119
but information alone has no inherent

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,600
value

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,799
it's only information that is developed

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,200
into knowledge

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,159
that has value and that's the difference

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,159
between

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,520
explicit knowledge which someone can

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,460
find in a

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,320
a binder um your

00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,560
[Music]

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,360
hiring practices or you know your

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,680
onboarding

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,799
information and tacit knowledge which is

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
the information

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,320
that i have taken i have learned on my

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,479
job

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,520
um to how to do my job more effectively

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,000
and efficiently

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,600
and to be able to scale that share that

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,920
with an organization so you can scale it

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,439
to that end my goal is to democratize

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,560
business school education so that

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,960
business leaders

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,759
anywhere particularly for marginalized

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,000
and vulnerable

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,600
vulnerable communities can develop the

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
skills and knowledge they need to build

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,920
successful businesses

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,240
at the intersection of theory and

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,560
application lies knowledge

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,320
creativity innovation and the

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,039
opportunity to redefine

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,920
our global capitalist system without

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,920
white supremacy

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,560
so let's define terms i am an educator

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,120
and i always start with terms because i

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,480
would like

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,640
so everybody's on the same page

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,400
privilege people get so triggered by

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,760
this word privilege and privilege is

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,680
simply about access

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
i don't know how many of you seen um

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,920
national geographic story

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,360
shows or you nature shows about these uh

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,000
monkeys that um

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,760
that are in these warm springs in in

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
japan during the winter

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,959
um what it seems like when they when

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,800
they present it on

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,239
shows it's like this harmonious thing oh

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,599
my god look how great this is

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,280
but that's not really what's going on

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
here what's going on here and you can

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,160
see

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
there's a fam a matriarchal family that

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,360
gets to stay in the hot springs

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,120
and the other uh monkeys that are around

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
are doing everything they can to

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
ingratiate themselves

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,159
to the privilege the people who have the

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,400
privilege to have access to these warm

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,959
springs

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,040
underrepresented is simply about numbers

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,319
in this photo you have

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,000
several men and one woman the woman

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,480
is underrepresented marginalized is

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,959
about

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,480
treatment and that is about groups of

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,519
people it's not about the individual

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,000
diversity is simply about variety so i

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,720
always

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,040
often use this um this example if you

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,760
have a box of crayons if i

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,599
you give me a box of crayons and there

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,720
are only four crayons in it

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,640
it's gonna be a very ugly picture

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,560
you know i can i can't get too creative

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,920
with it it's gonna be very ugly

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,599
because i'm not i don't consider myself

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
an artist it's you know it's going to be

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,640
a very

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,799
good ugly picture but if you give me a

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,879
box of 64 crayons

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
it still may be a very ugly picture but

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,599
it's going to be a colorful picture

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,680
there's some things that i can do

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,360
i can mix colors together create my own

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,920
colors there's some things i can do with

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,519
the 64 box crayons that i

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,920
um unless i'm an expert in art

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,360
um i can't really make four crayons work

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,159
for me

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
and inclusion is simply about experience

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,959
you

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,880
don't get to say someone is included or

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,000
feels included in your organization or

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,120
your community

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,160
um or your event they based on their

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
lived experience

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
with you and your um and your

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,120
initiatives will tell you or tell

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,240
themselves if they feel included or not

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,199
so inclusion is not about equality it is

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,000
not about

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
one plus one equals two it is not about

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,400
i gave

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,280
harry um five cookies and i gave sarah

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,080
five cookies

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,720
so they're equal no that's not how it is

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,040
because

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,160
what we see in the real world you may

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,320
have given sarah

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
i mean harry five cookies but you

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,600
on sarah's cookies before you gave it to

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
her so that's not equality

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,919
she's not going to eat those cookies

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,800
inclusion is also not about

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,280
quotas it's not about oh we need so many

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,680
women

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,199
we need so many people from the lgbtq

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,280
community we need so many people of

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,360
color we need so many indigenous

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,479
individuals we need so many black people

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,840
it is not about quotas

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,360
inclusion is about equity it is about if

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,560
i gave um uh

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,000
uh let's say sarah again sarah a hundred

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
dollars to buy groceries

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,080
and i gave maggie a hundred dollars to

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,039
buy groceries but sarah lives in a

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,880
community

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,600
where um the grocery stores near her

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,039
um have fresh fruit she there's farmer's

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,360
markets near her they're actually

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,800
farms around her the quality of food

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,199
that sarah gets

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
is better than maggie if maggie's

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,080
community is

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
a food desert she doesn't have a car to

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,479
get anywhere she has to take an

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,199
uber or lyft um or bust that is not

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,800
equality

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
um that's that's what people would

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,400
consider equality

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
i'm looking for equity we need to make

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,319
sure that maggie's experience with food

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,440
is is on par with sarah's experience of

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,440
food so that means

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,479
although sarah doesn't need these other

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,160
things um we would give make sure that

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,880
maggie has access to um

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,080
to get to whatever food thing so we

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,400
would add more money

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,840
or ensure that um give her an account

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,919
with an uber or lyft or

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,680
a bus card or something we would make

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,319
sure that the quality of food in her

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,919
community

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
if the quality of fuel in her community

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,600
is not equal to sarah's we will make

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,160
sure that she can get to a place

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,639
and get back home comfortably to um from

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,400
getting

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,319
that same quality of food that is what

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,919
equity is it is saying

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,759
what do we need to do so these

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,240
experiences that these two individuals

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,919
have

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,840
are more equitable so again i said equit

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,840
um inclusion is about experience

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,360
so let's talk about racism racism

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,919
is race prejudice plus social and

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,280
institutional power

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,120
racism is a system of advantage based on

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,000
race

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,479
racism is a system of oppression based

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,479
on race

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,479
racism is a white supremacist system

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,360
racism is different from racial

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,240
prejudice

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,000
hatred and discrimination race of racism

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,360
involves one group having the power to

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,199
carry out systematic

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,639
discrimination through the institutional

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,960
policies and practices of the society

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,960
and by um shaping the cultural beliefs

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,319
and values that support those racist

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,479
policies and practices

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,639
and this is why there's a distinction

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,080
between underrepresented

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,680
which are individuals and

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:52,240
margin marginalized which are groups so

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:56,000
white women in tech are underrepresented

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,360
they are also not unless they have an

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,319
intersection of

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,919
another marginalization they are not

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,479
marginalized in tech

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,479
white women benefit from white supremacy

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,080
we also have to talk about

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,720
anti-blackness because anti-blackness

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,879
has been the most successful strategy

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,960
of global import of a white supremacy

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,240
so the council of democratizing

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,560
education defines

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,520
anti-blackness as being a two-part

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,800
formation

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,800
that both voids blackness of value while

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,199
systematically marginalizing black

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,800
people

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,240
and and their issues so the first form

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,839
of anti-blackness is

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,839
overt um beneath this anti-black racism

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,440
is the covert structural and systemic

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,720
racism which

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,560
categorically predetermines the system

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,240
socioeconomic status of black people in

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,040
the united states and i add it globally

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,959
because anti-blackness is global

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,040
the structure is held in place by

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,839
anti-black policies institutions and

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,839
ideologies

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,839
and what you're seeing happening right

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,320
now particularly in the united states

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,320
and has

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,640
grown globally with black lives matter

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,760
movement

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,440
is talking about this overt

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,120
overt system institutional policies

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,440
that are designed for anti-blackness

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,200
the second form of anti-blackness is

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
this unethical

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,480
disregard of anti-black institutions and

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,120
policies

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,680
this disregard is the product of class

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,959
race

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,480
and or gender privilege

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,160
privilege certain individuals

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
experiences due to anti-black

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,920
institutions and policies

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,600
this form of anti-blackness is protected

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,720
by the first form of anti uh

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,480
form of overt racism so we see this

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,080
with um um black women are angry

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,720
um when i am a um

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
a manager and my subordinate as a white

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
person

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,120
how long it takes me as a black person

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,120
to craft an email

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,040
so that your feelings don't get hurt

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,600
because once white people's feelings get

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,440
hurt

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,680
then we're not talking about why what

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,680
was content in the email

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,120
now we have to talk about your feelings

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,720
white people need to learn how to manage

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
their feelings these are the things

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
that happen um these are the things that

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,760
that what

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,600
black anti-blackness this is how

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,320
anti-blackness shows up in our own

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,320
organizations

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,640
so we're going to get to the business

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,839
part of this so products and services

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,000
are not businesses and i

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,200
i i have to say this over and over again

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,360
because the majority of

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,720
organizations out there i would not call

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,800
businesses and this is

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,640
in in particular in the tech space they

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,240
are products and services that people

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,880
have been able to scale because they had

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,440
customers

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,079
but they have no procedures policies or

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,120
uh

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,800
uh or um procedures policies

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,279
or processes in place to scale

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,040
anything so every time you hire somebody

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,560
new it's an it's a different experience

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,640
every time there's an evaluation

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,320
that's a different experience or you're

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,320
using the evaluation and every

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,440
every person who every manager who's

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,360
using the evaluation

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,480
is using a different metric or has a

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,160
different interpretation or

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,920
understanding of how that metric is

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,000
that is not a business that is an

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,120
organization so product or service alone

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,519
is not a business

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,519
and you cannot measure what you manage

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,399
what you cannot measure

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,920
and for me this speaks to my heart many

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,360
marginalized entrepreneurs

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,959
overwhelmingly create

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,200
jobs for themselves rather than

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,320
businesses um

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,839
you see this with um you know

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,120
as someone who is a um

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,880
a a an accountant um you see this with

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
someone who's a house cleaner

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,079
you see this with someone who's a

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,440
handyman they're creating jobs for

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:46,079
themselves rather than a business

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,880
all too often organizations fail cannot

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,079
scale and

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,000
or become toxic because their leaders

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,600
don't understand that growth requires

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,839
processes that enable

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,079
connectedness innovation and competitive

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,079
advantage

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,720
successful organizations are built on a

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,720
foundation that enables leaders to turn

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,560
information into knowledge in order to

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,399
scale evolve

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,680
and recover and this goes back to what i

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,360
was saying the difference between

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,079
explicit knowledge which is something

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,920
that you can put in a binder and share

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,079
um and that worked when we were creating

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,880
widgets because when someone got on the

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,399
assembly line

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,320
their widget needs to look like

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,639
everybody else's because that widget

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,920
fit in a thousand different things we're

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,120
not creating that

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,120
that anymore and we're not in

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,160
manufacturing industrial economy we are

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,920
a knowledge economy

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,399
so you need to be able to get out of my

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,040
head what i've learned about your

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,880
business

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,560
so that you can use that for competitive

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,560
advantage and that's tacit knowledge

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,320
the ability of organizational leaders to

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,440
successfully create and manage

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,240
operations relies

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,160
heavily on how well they do they are at

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,880
developing these necessary processes

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
again this is

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,279
the difference between having an

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,360
organization and having a business

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,200
when leaders take the time to understand

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,240
and operationalize their organization's

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,320
functions

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,160
they avoid common barriers barriers

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,320
success to success

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,320
while being able to recover more quickly

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,079
for unexpected events

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,160
um i'd say all the time um right now

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,360
most companies don't think about risk

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,639
management

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,360
enough but increasingly they're having

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,440
to deal with

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,639
crisis management so risk management is

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,560
a proactive

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,639
um process crisis management is a

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,279
reactive process and increasingly we're

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,200
seeing

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,959
people having to deal with crisis

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
management issues particularly when it

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,920
comes to

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,120
employers employees who are on their off

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,680
time behavior

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,040
whose off time behavior is impacting

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,680
their organizations

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,399
or whose partners or organizational

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,120
partners

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:53,519
behavior is impacting your business

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,199
building a successful organization with

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,360
fewer unintended consequences

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,320
requires more than just a great product

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,720
and service

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
it requires leaders being able to give

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,399
all stakeholders the

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,880
experiences they want and the ability to

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,040
manage the processes

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,800
so i want to talk about stakeholders so

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,839
in traditional

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,959
um business we talk about shareholder

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,440
value only

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,160
and and that means that our only

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,519
priority

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,800
is to make sure and sure ensure that

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,839
whoever invests in us are getting um

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,240
a money back or you know then they are

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,360
successful at their investments because

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,399
by law

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:38,240
um if a business has an

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,360
opportunity to um make more money for

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,000
shareholders and they

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,680
opt out and they then shareholders can

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,480
actually sue the ceo and the board of

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,199
directors

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,760
and this is where people um have a

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,560
problem

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,720
with understanding fundamentally to me

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,519
what capitalism is and how capitalism

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,360
works

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,279
um and so uh it is

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,760
you a lot of the things that we want to

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,320
do as the society to improve businesses

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,720
by law by how these organizations are

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,040
structured we can't do it that way

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,320
so a stakeholder is all those people who

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,639
work with you

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,240
all those people who partner with you

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,240
all those people who buy from you

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
and all those people who invest in you

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,199
and then those go

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,480
in the hierarchy you have to make sure

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,600
that the people who work with you are

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,519
taken care of first

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
work for you are taken care of first and

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,959
then you extend that

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
that circle of influence out to those

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,600
people who partner with you because as i

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,680
said before

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,279
we don't want to have partners who whose

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,600
behavior negatively impacts

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,519
our business our reputation and then you

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,720
focus on the people who buy from you

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,160
because once you have the people who

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
work for you and the people partner with

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,279
you

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,880
in alignment then the people who buy

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,199
from you get that experience

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,880
and once that happens the people who

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,720
invest with you will get

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,279
uh the best investment that they can

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,160
going from a product to service focused

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,199
to

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,320
business focused model uh takes time

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,160
intention strategy strategic effort

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,079
all are necessary in order to innovate

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,480
differentiate and compete in information

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,040
age

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,839
and this is where i have an issue with

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,720
um the

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,519
the facebook uh ethos which has

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
permeated

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,800
tech the move fast break things move

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,399
fast break things

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,079
i don't fundamentally have a problem

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,680
with moving fast breaking things

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,279
what i have a problem is the fact that

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,800
most of us in tech move fast break

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,440
things move fast break things move fast

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,000
break things

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,000
and we never stop to figure out who what

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,199
we broke how we broke it who was harmed

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,440
and how we can fix that

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,480
and minimize harm in the future those

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,880
are the components that are missing

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,560
also building stakeholder value rather

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,720
than shareholder value

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,480
focused organizations is a proactive

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,440
approach to addressing inclusion

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,560
diversity safe spaces and developing a

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,959
harm reductive

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,720
reduction perspective this is why i say

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,000
i am not an inclusion and diversion

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,000
diversity specialist it's only because

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
um the conclusion of diversity should be

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,639
the bedrock of every organization

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
that is focused on bill being successful

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,160
in the information economy

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,919
it's the fact that most organizations

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,319
the majority organizations don't have

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,919
that that have to spend so much time

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,839
addressing inclusion and diversity in

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,240
these organizations before i can even go

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,959
into and start building out the process

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,480
procedures

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,959
and policies they need to um to move to

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,000
a business structure

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,480
when leaders create organizations around

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,120
well-defined and tested core values that

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,240
consider the needs of all stakeholder

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,520
stakeholders and have processes in place

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,679
to monitor progress

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,720
they are less likely to discover at some

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,240
point in the future

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,840
that they've been nurturing an

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,520
exclusionary environment

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:50,160
which with unintended consequences

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,320
so the process for shifting to product

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,080
to service focus to a business focused

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,120
business

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,960
step one imagine imagine the ideal

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,240
stakeholder experience and write that

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,080
down in detail

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,480
and you want to use as many adjectives

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,200
as you can um and it's not a judgment

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,960
call you're just

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,280
writing this stuff out you just want to

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,679
get it out of your head and think about

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,960
what that ideal stakeholder experience

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,320
would be

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,520
and you want to define that you want to

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,160
come up with your define your core

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,679
values

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,720
and equally important the indicators of

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,039
success that will

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,799
let you understand or see forget

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,679
understanding demonstrate

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,880
that your core values that the um that

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,080
the

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,960
um the imagine part the details are

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,120
are being uh implemented or designed

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,440
into your organization

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,960
then you want to apply you want to apply

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,000
measurement to these indicators because

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,919
as i said you cannot

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,400
measure manage what you cannot measure

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,360
and you want to test the indicators with

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,000
stakeholders

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,320
um and this is the move fast break

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,400
things hey let's stop we broke something

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,679
what what do we break how do we break it

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,760
um did we

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,520
hurt anybody how do we make amends what

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,200
do we do next that's the thing that's

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,080
the step that you need to take so it's

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,240
not just

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,240
testing and getting this data this data

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,679
should inform your choices moving

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,320
forward

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,840
then you want to evaluate that

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,960
measurement to determine

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,720
if your benchmarks were met and then

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,720
once you've done that a few times

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,160
um iterated that process a few times

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,640
then you want to standardize these

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,880
things

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,080
because the more you have a process for

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,880
more the more you

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,120
can easily communicate to individuals

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,799
inside and outside of your organization

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,760
uh the more you can um do that

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,080
the more you have headspace and so if

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,640
you

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,720
if you have a standardized hiring

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,720
process that you've discovered

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,799
you've created that ensures that um

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,919
um so let me back up for a second

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,360
because i wanted to say

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,559
when i talk about inclusion and

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,440
diversity diversity is about recruitment

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,400
so that's that variety part inclusion is

00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,919
about retention

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,120
and that's that experience part of

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,000
whether people are going to stay in your

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,679
organization

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,120
so let's say you have developed a

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,640
process the processes

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,840
that have that ensure that you have a

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,880
very diverse workforce right and

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,840
you you want to standardize that if it

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,360
proves

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,159
that that also improves retention which

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,840
is inclusion

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,360
you want to standardize that so that

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,280
everyone who's hiring everyone who's

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,080
managing is saying and doing the same

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,159
things

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,280
so that you can once you do that you

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,280
have the bandwidth

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,679
you have the mental capacity as an

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,080
organization to deal with now the risk

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,919
management

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,840
and crisis management issues that may

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,600
come come up because they do

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,600
um and this is why i say we talk about

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,440
reduction of harm and minimizing harm we

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,360
will never eliminate harm

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,679
because there are too many outlines

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,159
there are too many variables

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,440
so some important considerations core

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,080
values should inform

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,320
all organizational decisions remember

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,120
that this is an ongoing process it is an

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,360
inter

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,960
iterative process it's a living process

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,600
it's not like you do something put it

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,080
down and

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,919
you never come back to it this decisions

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,200
that are the result of these process

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,799
should be seen as immutable and should

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,760
not be seen as immutable

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,280
or rigid this is fluid organizational

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,120
leadership plans to review

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,640
whether stakeholder factors have changed

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,640
at least twice a year

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,919
this will enable them to proactively

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,559
anticipate shifts

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,280
and plan um shifting needs and plan

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,600
accordingly

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,720
so this should be this review should be

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,840
a process

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,280
um and it helps you create and and vet

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,280
the other processes that you have

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,400
so now i want to talk about the thing

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,640
that really gets my heart excited and

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,559
it's capitalism because i often see

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,720
on social media and just conversations

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,039
people like oh capitalism is evil

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,400
we got here because capitalism is evil

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,039
and that is not true

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,880
capitalism is a theory it was an idea it

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,120
was an idea it was how we have

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,000
implemented capitalism globally

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,039
that is problematic we globally have

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,080
inter um

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,120
have implemented capitalism rooted in

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,679
white supremacy

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,480
we have implemented capitalism that is

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,679
dependent

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,039
on harm reduction that is dependent on

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,559
exploitation that is dependent on theft

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:19,919
in the united states capitalism was

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,039
is was built on the annihilation of

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,679
indigenous people

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,400
and the enslavement of africans but that

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,799
is not

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,600
what capital how people um how adam

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,200
smith who mo um people consider

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,280
the grandfather of the father of

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,440
economics saw capitalism

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,360
he wrote two books one is the moral

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,840
sentiment he was thinking about morals

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,679
and then he wrote in 1776 and that the

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,440
year should seem very familiar to you

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,960
because that was when the us got

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,480
attended well some view as

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,640
white males got their independence in

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,200
the united states um

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,760
and he in 1776 he wrote wealth the

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,520
nations

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,840
so adam smith was thinking about

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,559
economics and morals

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,559
he was actually an abolitionist so the

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,679
founding fathers of the united states

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,880
intentionally decided that

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,919
the more to abstract the moral part of

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,400
um the adam smith

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,080
capitalist ideas out of because they

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,200
were in direct

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,760
um contrary to

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,960
having slaves adam smith was an

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,200
abolitionist

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,280
he did not approve of chattel slavery

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,720
so let's talk about profit i don't see

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,320
anything wrong with profit if you look

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,440
at that definition of um

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,280
let's go back if you look at the

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,720
definition of economic uh capitalism

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,440
it's just economics and political

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,480
systems

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,559
of which a country countries trade and

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,279
industry are controlled by private um

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,679
owners for profit rather than the state

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,120
so let's define profit a financial gain

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,000
especially the difference between the

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,520
amount earned

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,039
and the amount spent and buying

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,320
operating and producing something that's

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,279
what simply

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,520
ca uh profit is this is what oppression

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,880
is

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,440
and this is what capitalism as a global

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,960
economic system is built on it is built

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,159
on profit

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,720
with oppression prolonged cruel

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,000
or unjust treatment of control i want

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,039
people to start thinking

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,480
through the lens of profits without

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,240
oppression

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,679
so this helps me have a conversation

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,600
with an individual i don't need to know

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,880
your morals i don't need to know your

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,480
values i don't need to know your

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,480
religious beliefs i don't need to know

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,240
any of your ideologies it is simply me

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,440
asking do you believe that or do would

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,159
you like to build an

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,120
organization build a business that can

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,600
be profitable

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,200
not can that is profitable without

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,640
relying on the oppression and

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,760
exploitation and the

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,039
death of other people

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,159
instead of mixing capitalism with social

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,320
justice and it's like

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,559
we're doing this capitalism is rooted in

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,120
white supremacy and yet we're trying to

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,559
wrap social justice on top of that they

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,320
are not congruent

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,080
what about shifting the lens to

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,440
capitalism as

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:05,600
social justice capitalism without um

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,840
oppression as social justice

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,760
democratizing business school education

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,120
is a social justice and

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,120
anti-racist movement

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,559
let's move from elite campuses where

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,640
only

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,000
the most privileged and powerful learn

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,000
how to build this

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,520
um build businesses to have this

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,640
information this knowledge and share it

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,799
with each other

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,000
let's move that to main street where

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,679
your average individual

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
who would like to build a scalable

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,440
business can

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,799
have this information it also will talk

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,000
about the wealth gap

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,440
nothing improves the the

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,880
the circumstances of the most

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,080
marginalized and vulnerable when it

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,200
comes to the wealth gap

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,240
then building businesses that

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,320
um are able they are able to scale so

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,240
that they can pass something on

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,679
to um generationally let's turn business

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,360
research into action

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,039
it shouldn't be just in these books it

00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,840
shouldn't be business research shouldn't

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,760
just be

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:07,440
um the the domain of academics or

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,320
um economist um and these hal brow

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,000
you know conversations it should be

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,840
everybody on main street should be

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,520
able to have a conversation about how

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,559
business research should inform their

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,760
decisions on building

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,880
and growing their businesses and it also

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,960
establishes

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,840
harm reduction as an organizational

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,840
imperative

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,279
so how do i get to this place um i just

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,159
want to give you a little bit before i

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,559
wrap up

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,279
hashtag call the scene has four guiding

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,480
principles

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,120
and they are in order of importance as

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,279
they

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,720
um the most important is the last one

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,480
but you can't get to the last one

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,960
without understanding internalizing

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,640
these so let me walk you through these

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,640
tech is not neutral we need to

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,840
understand that every

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,320
technology is biased it was created by a

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,000
human being and human beings are biased

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,520
and this is where we mess up in tech

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
when we only value

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,960
quantitative evidence quantitative

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,799
research

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,240
qualitative research is about lived

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,760
experience it's about

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,279
and you need both and which is

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,440
considered mixed method

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,200
you need to understand the data but you

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,840
also need to understand how you got to

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
the data

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,200
what was the lived experience of the

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,840
people or the situations that got you

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,360
the data

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,440
and that should be informing your

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,679
decisions also

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,120
intention without strategy is chaos this

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,039
is one of the biggest

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,240
obstacles that i see in organizations

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,120
who want to be anti-racist who want to

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,919
have a

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,120
to be more inclusive and and um and

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,960
improve diversity

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,600
they have an intention but they don't

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,520
have a strategy which causes chaos

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,039
lack of inclusion is a risk management

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,000
issue and i'm

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,399
more often saying it's also increasingly

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,240
a

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,000
crisis management issue based on the

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,799
things that i've said before

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,559
um you when you have a lack of inclusion

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,919
there are so many blind spots

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,200
so many things that you don't understand

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,720
you don't even know what you don't even

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,720
know and you're creating products and

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,640
services that cause harm

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,919
and the most important thing we need to

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,640
do which gets us

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,039
to profit without oppression is we need

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,200
to

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,279
prioritize the most vulnerable their

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,120
voices should be

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,039
lifted up and amplified because the most

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,679
vulnerable are the ones with the lived

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,200
experience

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,799
we need to create the products and

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,320
services that are

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,399
um that work and create success in the

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,480
knowledge economy

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:37,950
thank you and have a wonderful day

00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,950
