00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,320
hello everybody

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,480
and welcome to the uh jam stack panel at

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,160
graphql.com

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,800
so i would love to start with uh

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,240
introductions for each of the panelists

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,520
um i'll call them out because i don't

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,680
know if they're on the same order in

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,279
there

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,640
um kyle would you like to introduce

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,240
yourself first because you're in the top

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,039
left

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,840
sure hey everyone i'm kyle and i'm a web

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,840
developer at tinder

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,879
uh aisha hi my name is aisha blake and i

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:45,520
am a staff software engineer at gatsby

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,600
sierra hi i'm siora

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,559
i am a learner advocate and instructor

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,399
at egghead i o

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,360
and i'm also getting into the cloud

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,360
engineering space

00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,399
and jason uh yeah i'm jason langsdorff i

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
host an internet tv show called learn

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,800
with jason

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,080
and i'm also a principal developer

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,400
experience engineer at netlify

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,280
awesome you are all wonderful people

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,560
i've met

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
all of these people before and known

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,520
them for quite a while so this is going

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,799
to be an exciting panel

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,520
um i'd like to start with some basic

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,479
stuff like

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,880
what is the jam stack uh sierra could

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,920
you

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,040
tell us what the jam stack is sure so

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,720
jams that

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,680
basically stand for javascript apis and

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,479
mark down markup i would say computer

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,680
too

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,680
but that's beside the point um but

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
what i've learned recently is that it's

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,680
not so much about

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,000
specifically dealing with jam like

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,200
javascript or apis or even markdown it's

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,799
more about the

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,720
architecture of the application that

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,200
you're building so

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,600
even if you use a tool that's not

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,720
necessarily based in javascript maybe

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,000
you're using something that's based on

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,000
movie or python

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
if you still have the other two factors

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,640
it's still considered a jam stack

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,240
application

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,040
um so it's not like a strict like

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,800
mold that you have to fit into for you

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,039
to have a dead

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,920
fantasy application to me it's more so

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,640
like a

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,640
workflow or

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,760
yeah i definitely totally agree with

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,400
that uh and that was a great way to put

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,239
it

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,480
um jason i'm curious uh

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,480
so is serverless part of the jam stack

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,280
well uh i think that if you if you think

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,959
of the jam stack as being an

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,239
architecture like sora said

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,440
then you have um there's just a

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
separation of

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,040
you've got your front end up here and

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,959
then you've got your

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,879
kind of your data layer your business

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,239
logic back ends back here

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,920
and it kind of doesn't matter what that

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,120
back end is made from and so

00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,879
i would say that the serverless is an

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,760
easy way to create a back end or

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,440
a business logic layer for jam stack

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,760
apps because the barrier to entry is

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,319
much lower i don't know that it's

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,000
i so sure yes it's part of the jam stack

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,760
but only in the sense that like anything

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,840
can be part of a jam stack architecture

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,080
if you're using the jam stack

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,599
architecture

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,000
anything can be jam if you squeeze it

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,000
hard enough

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,400
i'm here for it

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,400
so we've gone over like a couple of

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,480
different things that uh people consider

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,000
to be the jam stack um what does it look

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,000
like to use the jam stack kyle

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
yeah so the jam set is really

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,760
interesting because i feel like it's

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,959
kind of like a renaissance of

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,319
of uh of static of sorts like it uses

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,400
all of the great things

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,840
of the internet today when a user goes

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,159
to your server

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,640
a lot of times it's a little bit dynamic

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,239
your server is grabbing things from apis

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,400
maybe it's grabbing something from

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,680
wordpress and your database

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,080
and um it also has nods back

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,239
to maybe like the 1990s or the early

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,879
2000s when you take your static html

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,200
file

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,479
and you'd push it up using ftp to like

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,320
go daddy or something

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,519
it's kind of like a mix between the two

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,479
because you have this

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,840
dynamic side that's now on run time with

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,560
jamsac we kind of push

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,720
all of that to the build so now like

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,960
when you're running your jam stack build

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
it does all of those database wordpress

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
calls ahead of time

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,520
i should say most not maybe not all and

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
uh

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,080
that way now you can serve these static

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
assets on a cdn

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,080
and usually those are cacheable so all

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,880
of the dynamic stuff is done ahead of

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,040
time

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,160
um so what does it look like developing

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
in jam stuck

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,080
uh well it feels like you're a lot of

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,720
times working in react and components

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,960
and having

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,280
a maybe longer than uh longer than

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,360
expected build time but then on runtime

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,680
your users feel this really fast

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,600
exciting experience where it's like oh

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,560
i'm just opening files on my desktop

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,960
because it feels like that you're

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
opening a static file from a cdn that's

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,880
cached

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
um so i mean yeah jamstack is kind of

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,800
like a renaissance of

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,520
of of the spa of the single page

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,400
application

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,000
frameworks yeah that makes a lot of fun

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,120
or even server based framework even

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,120
server based websites sorry

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,320
um you mentioned a trade-off between

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,479
like build time and

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,520
uh runtime and i know that uh aisha has

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,320
experienced with

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,520
one of the modern like uh big meta

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,840
frameworks that we kind of kind of

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,479
associate with jam stack and gatsby

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,840
and i was wondering like so if we're

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,639
going to move stuff to build time

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,240
what benefits does that give us

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,360
absolutely

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,320
so when we're moving stuff to

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
to build time we're putting the focus on

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,800
that experience that your end user is

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,520
going to have

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
and you know when we're when we're

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,360
striking that balance

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,639
we're also thinking we're also thinking

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,919
about developer experience we're

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,680
thinking about

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,880
you know how can how can we make this as

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,080
easy as pos as easy as possible to use

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:16,560
and get kind of get you to that build

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,319
point uh but then um for your end user

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
we're saying it's so it's so so

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,080
important for that person

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
to have the best possible experience and

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,000
we're

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,120
continuously working towards making

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,960
especially gatsby sites as

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,280
fast and as and as accessible as as we

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
can

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,199
yeah and i think that that's uh that's a

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
really interesting focus of

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,039
the gatsby team in particular but i

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
think that uh the jamstack ecosystem has

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,560
put a focus on

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,160
accessibility uh in a way that like

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,840
didn't quite exist before in the single

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,520
page application era

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,880
um so one thing i am really curious

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
about kyle you mentioned like

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,560
pulling data in from like all assorted

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,440
back ends

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,800
and this is a graphql comp right so and

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
i also know that you've worked with

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,280
wordpress

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,639
so how do you how do you connect

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,880
jamstack uh

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,080
to wordpress and is is the answer

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,280
graphql or is it something else

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,680
well that's that's a really good

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,960
question so um

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,919
yes i i i've had uh in previous

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,319
like i've worked on this website called

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,560
swipelife.tinder.com

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,840
and it's it's a blog uh that's based off

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,840
of wordpress

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,599
and um one of the cool things about a

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,039
lot of jam stacked websites

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,960
is that it's able to pull

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,599
all this information from a traditional

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,160
cns cms like wordpress

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,280
um and this happens on build time what

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,280
jam stack

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,800
frameworks like gatsby does is it hits

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,160
every single endpoint if you're using

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
the rest version of

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
a wordpress it hits a lot of uh

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,919
endpoints

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,039
grabs all the information and stuffs it

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,960
into a

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:02,080
awesome centralized data um graphql

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,879
and the react components all kind of act

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,759
as their own

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,400
client they all grab the graphql data as

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,960
they need

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,800
and use it as they see fit and so what

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,319
you end up seeing is a lot of jam stack

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,759
developers saying aha there's a

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,440
centralized data store

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,520
many clients using this data in many

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,039
different ways graphql

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,840
is a beautiful solution to to this

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,400
problem so that's why we use graphql

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,039
also

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,960
what's really interesting here is that

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,000
netlify they did a survey

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,599
a couple of months back they asked how

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,959
many people are using rest versus

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,039
graphql

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,560
and these jam stack dev said right now

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,000
we're using a lot of rest

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,240
however the next question was do you

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,240
prefer graphql or request

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
and a lot of people said i prefer

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,880
graphql

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,080
and so what you're seeing is you're

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,600
going to be seeing a shift of people

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,519
moving away from rest

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,160
over to graphql who are working on the

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,320
jam stack and there's a reason for that

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,320
the reason is because when when these

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,120
jam stack static site generators are

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,519
building

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,040
they have to crawl every single endpoint

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,240
and and rest to grab all this

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,000
information

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,279
however if you're using a graphql

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,240
endpoint uh

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,040
like a wp graphql made by jason ball for

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,600
example

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,040
uh you only have to crawl one or two

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
endpoints the number of endpoints is a

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,760
lot less

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,600
uh so there's a lot of work being done

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,760
out there and graphql

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,320
serves a really important part more ways

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,760
than one within our jam set community

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,880
that makes sense makes sense to me

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,880
chat does that make sense to you

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,200
kyle mentioned that netflix put out a

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,560
survey on like breast versus graphql

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,480
and jason i'm wondering if you have any

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,680
insight into sort of the adoption of

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,680
graphql with

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,279
jam stack sites or with respect to jam's

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,519
back sites anyway

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,320
i i don't have any hard stats but what i

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
do have

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,440
is um just kind of a qualitative like

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,480
from talking to people in the community

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,800
and seeing what they're

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,880
doing and what they're interested in um

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,640
graphql is is gaining a lot of steam and

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,399
i think that makes a lot of sense

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,640
because when you're talking about what

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,440
the jam stack architecture is doing

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,320
it's unlocking front-end developers from

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,480
back-end teams

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,600
in a sense that you can quickly build a

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,040
front end and you can

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
prototype something you can get it up on

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,000
the internet without having to

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,240
go through kind of a cumbersome ops flow

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
or complicated staging processes or

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
or heavy deployment which means that

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,920
teams can move more quickly

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,519
and when you look at graphql graphql

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,079
kind of is the same thing

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,519
for data where graphql is taking what

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,440
used to be this kind of

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,720
complicated you know how do we figure

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,560
out which rest points are still

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,519
maintained how do we make a change to

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,440
rest data

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,279
how do we know like what's coming from

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,360
where and graphql

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,760
decouples that it turns graph it turns

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,920
the data into a self-documenting layer

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,760
that can exist outside of of direct

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,760
communication and direct support

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,519
from these from back-end teams so it

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,320
allows both sides of the the dev

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,040
spectrum

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,600
to work more independently and i think

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
that as

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,480
teams start to develop the the workflow

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,079
benefits of graphql or the workflow

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,839
benefits of the jam stack

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,680
they start looking for it elsewhere in

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,079
their their process and i think that

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,519
it makes it a natural transition if you

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,720
start using graphql

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,680
you're going to start looking at the jam

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,279
stack or vice versa

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
and that that's really interesting

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,760
because it kind of draws a parallel

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,200
between

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,959
uh jam stack graphql and serverless in

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,240
terms of like the operational

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,760
deceleration that were

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,519
is sort of happening across all of them

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,519
right you don't need to run a server

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
uh and then i guess you don't still need

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,440
to run a server for serverless right i

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,519
mean that's the kind of point

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,160
and then graphql makes these people

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,680
problems easier to approach

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,040
um which makes me wonder like if i don't

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,040
know anything about jam stacks

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,519
you're a how does somebody get started

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,760
in jam stack

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,600
i think the best thing you can do is to

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,760
build a jam

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
project like of course i i know i run

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,519
into this problem when i'm learning

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,440
something new my first instinct is like

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,880
i'm going to gather all these resources

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,720
and i'm going to take a bunch of courses

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
and take all these notes which is great

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
like

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,079
of course you want to watch courses and

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,600
you want to take your notes and do all

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,440
that good stuff but the best thing for

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,519
me personally in my own experience

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,240
is to actually start building a project

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,240
um because

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,320
the most important parts are you get to

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,079
see what you really

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,160
what you don't understand and then

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,680
another thing i think is great to do is

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,360
to um it's just to create content for

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,800
other people to see so like learn in

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
public share what you're learning with

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
other people

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,639
whether that means sharing on twitter i

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,360
know some people stream on twitch if

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,560
they learn

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,480
things like jason does um you can also

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,160
write articles for other people to read

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
it's like a great way to really solidify

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,000
your

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
your knowledge with the james which i'm

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
like in the process of doing i haven't

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,320
like put anything

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,839
out there as far as my own learning

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,880
experience with game tech but i think

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,440
it's a great way to

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,959
to really get to really get a solid

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,440
foundation in your understanding of

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,440
jamestick

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,720
cool um we have a question from chat

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,760
that

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,680
is uh how is jamstack different from

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,480
amp or amp i actually don't know how to

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,839
pronounce that acronym

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
and this is going to be open to anybody

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,000
because i'm not sure which of you is

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,440
going to

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,600
answer it so uh i guess raise your hand

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,600
no

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,160
and if not i'll put it on jason

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,120
it's jason

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,240
jason uh amp and jam stack what's the

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,600
difference what are they like

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,519
uh should i care about it so

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,800
amp is a i you could call it a subset of

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,440
the jam stack so

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,440
um they they are effectively

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,880
accomplishing the same goal so the amp

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,720
is a an opinionated way to build jam

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,120
stack sites um and and

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,959
what that means is that the google team

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,760
built the amp framework as a way to

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,760
remove

00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,480
as much back-end dependency as much um

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,000
you know as many blocking things from

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,160
the process of building a site as

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,320
possible in an effort to make these

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,600
sites load very very quickly

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,760
and have um you know as

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,279
good a shot as working offline as you

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,440
can give a website without

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,800
explicitly engineering it to be an

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,959
offline app

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,920
um and and through doing that they they

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,600
were able to

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,639
um you know unblock developers and so i

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,199
think that what

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,839
what we've seen is that amp was kind of

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,199
like the

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,800
first salvos the opening salvo of

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,639
like building jam stack sites and i

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,600
think the community took what was good

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,000
from amp

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,680
and uh and has started to adopt those

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,079
into workflows across

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
all parts of the web so that if you want

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,279
to build an amp site you can

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,800
but you can also get away from some of

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,480
the restrictions of amp while keeping

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
all of the benefits by using other jam

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,600
stack frameworks

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,199
so they're you know they're two sides of

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,199
the same coin in a lot of senses

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,399
yeah thinking about it as a simplified

00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,920
jam stack is something that i actually

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,519
haven't done before and that makes a lot

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,560
of sense

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,839
um sierra mentioned uh that jam sac

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,360
sites are great for

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,839
sort of creating content learning in

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,040
public and uh like these very blog based

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,920
uh applications and aisha i'm wondering

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,680
if there are

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
other applications of the jam stack that

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,639
people are using that

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,160
maybe aren't blocked yeah absolutely

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:27,760
so there are um a number of

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,160
different uh applications that folks are

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,360
using the jam stack for and of course my

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,519
perspective is coming

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,800
from uh gatsby and

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,440
so often we're seeing folks using

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,320
using gatsby specifically but jam sac in

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,560
general

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
uh for creating e-commerce apps as well

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,360
ecommerce

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,839
uh and specifically

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:56,240
uh sort of direct to direct consumer

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,880
like uh which includes

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,000
uh some of the more typical use cases

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,160
that you might think of

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
like landing pages and that sort of

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,199
thing um

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,399
but yeah we see people combining

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,240
combining technologies to um come up

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,519
with this really

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,279
fast uh and as

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,440
and you know kind of using the

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,800
using all the benefits of the jam stack

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,720
to the rest of their

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,160
ability in those more app-like um

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,000
scenarios i i

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,600
i realize that you didn't call on me but

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,120
i i have to jump in because there's

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,639
i've seen a couple of just such

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,800
incredible things happen with the jam

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,320
stack that aren't blog sites

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,040
um there there is if you go into like a

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,519
popeyes

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,959
right now the ordering screens that

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,390
you'll see when you order in the

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:53,539
in the lobby those are jam stack sites

00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,539
[Music]

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,880
uh that's a jam stack site if you log in

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,079
to manage your network really

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,760
that's a jam stack site um if you go to

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,400
the starbucks mobile

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,240
ordering site that's a jam sac site so

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,880
there's so much incredible stuff that

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,760
you can do

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,679
with with the jam stack now um and and

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,199
i'm i'm really really blown away by

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,520
what the community is able to do with it

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,630
and and how many doors it's unlocked

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,079
my mind is like blown right now

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,520
[Laughter]

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,199
and i mean there's more too there's

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,200
little caesars little caesars move to

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,559
jam stuck right before the super bowl

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,960
yes we had a super bowl ad

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,640
and what's so cool about jamstack is

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,039
that you're serverless right

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,480
so like you can go from zero users to a

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,280
million users

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,480
and you wouldn't even know unless you

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,240
looked at the logs or knew you had a

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,520
super bowl commercial right now

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:54,240
um yeah the possibilities are endless

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,720
i shouldn't shouldn't say that but you

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,520
know

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,280
it's really cool but uh so there's

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,520
there's a project called the covet

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,240
cracking the covet tracking project

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,960
um that's that's run by kissane uh on

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,760
twitter

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,720
and they launched on the jam stack and

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,799
it became like

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,720
the resource like millions and millions

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,440
of api requests to this api that they

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,520
built

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,799
on uh they're using like i think they're

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,000
using serverless functions on the jam

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,280
stacker they might just be serving a

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,039
json file

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,559
um but they they put it all up on

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,080
netlify and

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,240
when they started getting these millions

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,080
of hits they didn't even notice like it

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,600
didn't register on their site they

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,520
weren't paying attention to traffic

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,080
because they just knew it was going to

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
work

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,280
it's uh it's really really interesting

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
from a scaling perspective because it

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,000
kind of

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,280
eliminates that concern you can't get

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,160
ddos anymore

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,360
you know short of a pretty sophisticated

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,039
ddos attack

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,480
and that's the thing that that's the

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,799
thing that really excites me

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,840
about the jam stack like when you can

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,600
have that kind of

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,440
impact and not worry about that's

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,360
that sort of thing like that's that's

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,200
something that's just almost completely

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,280
taken off your plate

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,039
when you're trying to do this super

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,640
super important work

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:10,240
that's that's what really like

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,160
makes it worth all the work

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,919
yeah yeah and i think it makes it much

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,960
more accessible too because you don't

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,280
have to

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,559
like from a person if i if i have a

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,320
project idea

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,679
i don't have to worry about oh well what

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,960
if i get all this traffic and i don't

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,160
know how to deal with service

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
i don't have time to learn all that kind

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,480
of stuff but you don't have to worry

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,320
about that now when you're building a

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,919
project with the jam tech which i love

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,440
because it lowers the barrier of entry

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,080
like if i have a project idea or a

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,080
business

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,280
idea that i want to pursue i don't have

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
to worry about all that kind of stuff i

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,360
can just

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,039
like learn the basic tooling for

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,640
jamestick and i can have a project in a

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,520
very short period of time if i can

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,520
launch i love that

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,280
i'm so happy that you are all on this

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,840
panel because it makes my job

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,840
so easy

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,120
um i'm very curious about what you all

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,960
are working on uh

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,320
so i'm just gonna like go around the

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,480
panelists and ask

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,600
everybody because uh i'm interested and

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,640
i think that chat uh

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,919
is also interested um so kyle

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,640
what are you working on like are you

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,919
working any jam stack projects right now

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,919
anything you can talk about anyway

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,039
yeah so like outside of work projects um

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,039
one thing i noticed like a lot of us

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,640
engineers like obviously we all a lot of

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,440
us have these little projects on the

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,480
side right

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,159
um so whenever i do a freelance project

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,760
what's the first thing that the client

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,280
asks for well

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,760
how do i edit my website once i'm done

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,440
and so what i've been doing is by

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,960
defacto just by default

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,559
i've been making all of my freelance

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,400
websites jam stuck and connecting them

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,039
to a wordpress or contentful

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,480
instance uh because that way they can

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,320
edit the page's text

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,840
without contacting me without hiring

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,720
another developer um

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,600
and obviously like these these cms's

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,000
they're made for

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,039
writers to do what they do best any

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,039
content creator

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,559
it's made to empower these folks to

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,600
write text edit text and

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,799
and change content um to the to the best

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,480
of anyone's ability so

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,480
i always try to make my freelance

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,760
websites nowadays jam stack

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,000
so um specific urls right now i didn't

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,559
ask

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,400
any clients if i can share so i won't

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,960
share anything specific

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,400
but i totally recommend freelance

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,840
freelancers to go ahead and try out

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,600
jamstack because it's a great way to

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,440
allow your clients to edit the content

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,039
after the fact yeah that's really cool

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,880
um i use it with a bunch of my clients

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,600
as well so that makes a lot of sense to

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,320
me

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,640
um kyle mentioned some stuff about like

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
uh

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
documentation authoring and stuff like

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
that and so aisha i'm gonna i'm gonna

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
double stack questions on you

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,720
i'm gonna ask you about uh what it's

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,120
like to be

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,919
a content author in like a jam stack

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,080
environment

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,280
and also i'm going to ask you uh if you

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,480
have any damp stuff projects that you're

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,840
working on

00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:02,159
absolutely so what sierra said

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:05,280
about the jam sack being approachable

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:09,360
lowering the barrier to entry that is

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:12,880
basically like the core of my job and

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,520
that and i love that like i

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,159
it it gives me it gives me actual real

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,919
joy

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:23,039
to make this this platform

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,559
this uh this sort of ecosystem

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,480
more accessible to more people

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,960
because it gives them the power then to

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,840
make these incredible applications

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,120
that have a real impact on the world and

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,880
so it feels great

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,880
it feels wonderful um and it also gives

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,320
me the opportunity to interact directly

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,039
with our community

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,080
and so i'm like in i'm in the repo every

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,919
day and

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,120
i get to and i get to see what's

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,320
important to people

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,840
and i really enjoy that uh as for

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,600
projects that i'm working on right now

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,480
so there's one i'm in a sort of

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,679
similar situation and that i i can't say

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,039
exactly what it is

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,880
uh but it is an app that will basically

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,159
support the short film

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,360
uh industry uh and so i'm really excited

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,080
about that

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,360
um what i can say a little more about is

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,480
that my partner and i

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,000
are i know my partner and i

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,559
are um planning to

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,600
open a well so it started as a plan to

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,640
open a game shop

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,960
in detroit a board game shop i i know

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,960
kyle

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,400
and so now uh what i'm

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,320
what i'm kind of thinking through is

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,760
well what does that now look like

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,559
that now that we can't be physically

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,440
together

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,320
um and so we're we're thinking through

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,320
some ideas there

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,200
that's awesome yeah

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,960
i would love to dive deeper into that

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,460
but like you said i'm not going to

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,720
um

00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,000
[Laughter]

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,000
what are you working on what do you what

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,640
uh what jam stack stuff i know you have

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,159
a

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,679
project that you recently started is

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,960
there anything uh anything related to

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,320
that

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,559
yes yes so i am working on a project

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,640
called day in the life dot dev no one

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,840
goes no one visit the url because

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,200
nothing's there yet

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,480
but i i'm actually i started the project

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,840
for a lot of different reasons i'm

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,919
trying to like accomplish

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,760
a lot of different goals with one big

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,320
project so first off

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,679
i wanted to actually like stop reading

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,360
like remember earlier when i was talking

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,880
about like how i tried to learn jam

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,400
stick i wanted to stop reading about it

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,679
and actually build something

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,679
and i wanted to build something with

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,559
gets me because i tried to use guess you

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,799
before

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,159
and like i didn't do it the right way i

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,679
just like jumped into it without

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,159
actually trying to like read the box and

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,320
stuff

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,760
so i'm giving guest me another try and i

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,400
want to use it for this blog that i'm

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,640
building

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,840
which is going to intro i'm going to be

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,840
interviewing um

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,520
different developers in the field and

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,799
i'm going to have them like outline what

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,760
their schedule what their day-to-day

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,120
looks like so that

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,720
um people who are transitioning careers

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,919
people who are beginners or even people

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,440
who are looking to

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,960
who are in tech but want to transition

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,400
to a different role in tech so they can

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
see like what their workflow will

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,840
look like or what skills they would have

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,600
to build so

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,039
i'm trying to build that with a gaspi

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,640
and i just have to say this is really

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,720
cool because asia your

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,000
like docs have been helping me so much

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,440
because i don't know what i'm doing a

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,840
lot of the time

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,279
it's like whenever i have an error i go

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
to the docs now because i'm trying to

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,000
like do

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,000
better with the way i learned and it's

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,880
like yeah it's been making the process

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,480
so much better

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,320
and then aside from that i'm also

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,840
supposed to like i was

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,520
this has been on the back burner for way

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,120
too long but i'm supposed to be building

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,799
my own personal blog which like

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,880
i'm trying to build it with 110 but i

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,279
have a hard time focusing so

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,799
hopefully i'll get that out really soon

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,919
but yeah those are the two projects that

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,400
i'm working on with

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,400
damn stick

00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,320
i'm super excited to see those launch um

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,600
when you do you'll have to tweet it out

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
and we'll have to get some retweet

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,799
training going on that

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:12,000
uh okay i will jason jason i'm going to

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,000
limit you to a subset of your projects

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
probably wise um what what i love about

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,840
the jam stack is that it gives me the

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,200
ability to quickly throw out like

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,600
trolling sites so i have

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,760
uh i have a couple that i really like

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,360
like if you need to disambiguate your uh

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,120
your bearded white guys i built which

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,440
beard is this dot-com

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,600
or if you need to decide whether or not

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,159
sarah drasner has a sandwich i built is

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,640
sarahsandwich.netify.app

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,320
um but more seriously the the site that

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,600
i've been working on most seriously

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,360
is uh jason.af which was a

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,520
kind of a big overhaul of my personal

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,520
site it's got some fun things that i've

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,440
been working on from you know some

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,799
some kind of interactive stuff some some

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,559
sound design stuff i took a lot of

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,120
inspiration from folks like josh como

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,679
and

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,320
uh cassie evans new blog and folks like

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,720
that

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,480
um and i had a lot of fun with this one

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,679
right so it's a it's a it's a cool kind

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,200
of interactive site

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,039
but i wasn't gonna announce this until

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,640
next week but i figured why not i

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,080
just built a brand new site that i'm

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,240
super super happy about

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,200
um if you are familiar with the night

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,919
owl

uh code editor or the code editor theme

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,360
which was built by sarah drasner it's uh

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,240
it's one of my favorite themes out there

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,880
it's it's gorgeous it's kind of iconic

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,159
um

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,919
we were joking around that we should

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,600
make swag for it and

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,679

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,559
going to donate all of the profits to

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,320
right like we're going to stop selling

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,880
something that we were able to spin up

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,480
really really fast it actually took me

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,120
longer to vectorize the owl

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,880
than to build that site which is i think

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,080
a testament to how powerful the jam

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,760
stack is

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,000
wait are you literally saying it took

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:17,840
you longer to draw the rest of the owl

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,840
than to build literally

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,520
oh that's a super exciting project um

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,080
we are people url one more time yes

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,950

00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,760
[Laughter]

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,360
uh we are closing in on the end of the

panel

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,960
so i would love to go through really

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,720
quickly

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,640
and uh ask you all what you think the

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,120
future of the jam stack is

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,600
um let's start with kyle and then we'll

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,600
just go around

lot more people

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,200
getting involved in tech and getting

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,440
involved in

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,880
building projects and shipping projects

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,960
because like

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,320
this is such a one of my favorite things

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,760
about the jam stack like i mentioned

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,600
earlier is that it takes out a lot of

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,840
the work that you would have had to do

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,120
otherwise when it comes to building a

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,240
project so i think we're going to see a

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,960
lot more people

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,200
who are uh using jam tech as a way to

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,520
get into tech or maybe to get into

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,640
a different side of the tech industry um

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,760
and we're going to i feel like we're

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,559
going to see more e-commerce and more

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,679
people who are

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,440
building projects quickly just like

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,880
jason said with his night owl project

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,799
like that was something he could

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,159
end up really fast and i think we're

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,520
going to see a lot more of that and i

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,240
hope that people use it as an

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,240
opportunity to do good like need to

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,679
charity things like that so i'm excited

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,440
to see what people do

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,440
with uh jam tech tools

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,039
yeah i i'll uh i'll wrap up by just

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,279
echoing what everybody said i think

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,200
the the thing that i'm most looking

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,159
forward to is where we start to close

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,360
this gap

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,039
between um the idea that jam stack sites

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,880
are only static sites

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,640
and what they're actually capable of

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,519
because as i mentioned before

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,200
we're building very complex apps on top

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,519
of jam stacks architecture

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,919
so if we as we start to explore more of

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,240
that i'm really really excited to see

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,519
what people are capable of doing and

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,039
like ciora said

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,960
how much it's going to lower the barrier

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,399
to entry so that people can build these

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,960
really ambitious apps

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,919
without having to get 10 20 years of

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,519
experience across

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,960
all these different platforms and

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,559
languages to do it you can learn

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,720
javascript html

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,840
and css sprinkle some serverless

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,600
functions on it and

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,200
sprinkle a little graphql in there and

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,120
you've got a full-blown

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,559
billion dollar business you can you can

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,039
do it you can make that work and i think

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,320
that's

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,320
going to be a really exciting future

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,760
thank you all so much for being on this

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,440
panel i believe we are at

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:49,200
time um the back room can tell me if we

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,080
are not so we're going to wrap it up

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,679
here and

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,970
