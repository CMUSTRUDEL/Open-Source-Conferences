	00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,540
hey everyone my name is Jonathan Bruce

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,650
says so fun to be here thank you to Matt

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,599
for having me

00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,849
so I'm Jonathan Bruce imparted Clive

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,799
fair I've been with lad for for a little

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,830
over four months I tell you a little

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,330
about my history in a few minutes but

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,860
let's dig in

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,290
okay looking forward to the journey that

00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,690
we are on and so I'm here for a very

00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,420
specific reason because I'm part of a

00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:33,510
team tide fire who's building the next

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,910
generation platform at the edge but let

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,030
me take a quick field pull here who here

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,450
is familiar with CloudFlare that's great

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,480
and makes my job so much easier the

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,630
journey we are on here I feel it's like

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,730
an infrastructure revolution I've been

00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,760
around the block a couple of times I'm

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,790
20 years in this business and when I

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,590
started you know 1990s 2000 wholly owned

00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,540
data centers is the way in which if you

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,070
had an app or had an idea you'd have to

00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,439
go out and do a bit all this stuff for

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,900
yourself then we find ourselves in the

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,120
happy world whereby I had infrastructure

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,130
on demand where I was renting things and

00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,840
now we find ourselves the point whereby

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,210
we have more service computing

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,600
opportunity ahead of us and cloud fair

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,659
is completely part of that what it all

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,060
what it means from me from a service

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,590
perspective is that I get to think about

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,000
the problems I want to think about I'm

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,130
not going to worry about all these kind

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,130
of considerations about the costs and

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,600
the controls that to an extent is helped

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,570
with me but serverless really kind of

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,000
opens it up to a new key new opportunity

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,830
new capability and from the customers

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,930
that I see we're seeing really some

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,700
exciting things going on here but I'll

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,670
see the most exciting thing for me is

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,990
the cost revolution so we're moving from

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,390
thinking about how much you're paying

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,220
for machines to what I love to call the

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,320
Chinese menu if anyone who runs their

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,140
infrastructure on Amazon they have that

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,430
impossible calculator which if anyone

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,900
can figure out please come talk to me

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,939
because I'd love to know I don't know

00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,290
how that possibly would work but it's

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,850
all these kind of considerations you

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,489
have to put in term in terms of think

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,739
what's your CPU time you know how much

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:14,280
you're gonna pay for storage the one I

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,200
really detest is my daily egress but I

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,150
really want to just think of

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,830
my requests on how much my go and pay

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,390
from our requests which is very

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,280
synchronous and synonymous has had

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,890
servers computing cheap have been

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,720
thinking bad but I want to talk to you

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,489
about how tied fair is going to be part

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,170
of this program now unfortunately this

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:32,420
looks like the world's worst slide I've

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,970
ever produced so let me kind of help you

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,060
through this there's actually all these

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,650
dots represent the 12 they're at points

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,620
of presence we have about one hundred

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,299
and fifty two of them around the world

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,780
so this is North America South America

00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:50,420
Europe Africa Asia Australia so

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,370
apologize for the terrible slide but

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,829
what's really interesting my entire fare

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,750
at this time we have nine million plus

00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:00,170
customers growing every day at some

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,150
spectacular rates really interestingly

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,760
also by ten percent of the Internet

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:08,150
traffic today globally runs to try for

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,849
infrastructure and we see people you

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,370
know do bringing a variety of different

00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:15,950
properties to our infrastructure to take

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,340
advantage of you know core capabilities

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,200
of greater performance and reliability

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,480
not to get too salesy on this just to

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,670
kind of give you some basis is you know

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,799
the tri-quarter advantage of why people

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,150
come to us is about greater scalability

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,489
because they leverage our network

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,220
tighter integration across security and

00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:35,780
performance and greater reliability but

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,519
the real meat of this conversation today

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,069
is that something called cloud fire

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,340
workers now another show of hands who's

00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,940
heard of that for workers great this is

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,970
awesome

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,010
now again makes my job very easy but I

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,980
think what we've done with Type four

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,250
workers I'm in very advantage to joint

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,840
CloudFlare as running products some of

00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,180
you may know Kenton Varda who's been our

00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,650
architect behind this project who's

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,880
really been the driving force of this so

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,440
I have to do a quick shout out for him

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,549
of course

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,739
so Kenan I really came to think about

00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,389
what is the really core design glue go

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,209
for time for workers because what we

00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:16,700
want to do is you want to put five fairs

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,410
infrastructure into your hands we want

00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,169
to put into your hand so you can build a

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,820
custom capabilities using a standard

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,890
kind of capability such that you can

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,900
bring your complex logic not I don't

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,120
need to the edge but I actually run

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,850
your infrastructure run your business

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,370
processes closer to your customers so in

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,840
a sense we wanted to do this view using

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,000
kind of some capabilities available to

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,370
those so number one choice is we are

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,190
using the same API as the w3c

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,770
serviceworkers API we wanted to run

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:49,130
faster and with less memory than nodejs

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:52,340
process critically we wanted to allow

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:54,650
arbitrary sub requests and computation

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,860
and as you'll see that allows us to do

00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:01,190
super interesting things with workers

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,080
running on the edge and moreover it's

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,479
about making sure our developer

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,130
community understand it and Radhika are

00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,710
able to reason about what workers knew

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,240
for us the only great decision that was

00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,669
made early on in this project that is

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,050
based on the v8 JavaScript engine and

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,970
many of you are using that day-to-day

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,760
that's part of the chrome capability

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,930
gives us a whole set of capabilities

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,180
critically for the kind of use cases we

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,820
want to support workers that's about

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,430
building you know in process you know

00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,889
very immediate capabilities that are

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,800
highly sensitive to any latency concerns

00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:35,389
guess what VA s v8 is ideally placed to

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,020
I do this because it's built for a

00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:41,570
start-up all right so with workers what

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,800
we're seeing people doing is really

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,270
build a whole set of different

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,370
capabilities I'll walk you through some

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,289
of the technical details of the journey

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,090
of a worker throughout CloudFlare but

00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:52,430
let's look at let's take a few minutes

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,260
on this perspective what we are seeing

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,360
people doing is building and

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,990
capabilities whereby they can not only

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,000
improve their security posture of their

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,500
infrastructure they're now doing it at

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,110
the edge so they can protect their

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,849
origin form bad things happening one of

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,470
my favorite examples is a crowd called

00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:12,800
report you're I go look them up they're

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,620
great they process a ton of JSON and

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,020
they would now could process that Minaj

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,729
and never actually process that within

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,039
their argue which would cause them you

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:24,620
know irresponsible undesirable security

00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:26,840
effects we're facing a ton of people

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,250
doing user personalization as well I

00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,610
have a demo that were running through on

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,620
that as well what else and a bunch of

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,289
kind of infrastructural cost reduction

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,969
that we're seeing as well super super

00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:39,889
interesting it's a great developer tool

00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:41,870
we're running in JavaScript getting at

00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:45,830
unenthusiastic about it I'm really

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:48,379
excited to be put into so complex

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,759
business logic at your edge how does it

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,740
actually interact with it and what are

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,439
the kind of use cases that we see so

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,050
personalized user experiences a bunch of

00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,300
a/b testing you know to technibond

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,650
activity activity identifying users at

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,740
the edge and so much more you know what

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,389
it's a platform I am in happy position

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,699
that I get surprised will populate what

00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,560
people are doing with this every day I

00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,749
actually have a very interesting drone

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,340
use case that I'm working on that it's

00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:16,029
not quite there yet the next time I come

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,009
here I'll show you how it works okay I

00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:24,050
am feeling brave so we're gonna do a

00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:28,759
demo okay here's a free demo all right

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:30,439
see here we have cloud fire workers now

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,689
some of you might remember the cloud

00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,029
fire campaign when we did 1.1.11 who

00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,770
knows what that is it's great and you're

00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,460
using one done one Oh at one that's

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,740
excellent

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,409
so one no one no one does it gives us a

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,139
Public DNS that had an effect helps and

00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:47,509
privacy controls for any DNS lookups and

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,949
the service we offer for free at client

00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,289
fair or getting a ton of traction on it

00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,550
so I took a step back and said great

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:56,539
this has been a really interesting

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,069
marketing exercise and we should think

00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:01,099
about how we can potentially apply

00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:03,770
workers to this so how do I do this so

00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:06,649
what 1.1.1 is really all about it's

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,419
about internet data privacy so I took a

00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:11,330
think about what that might mean and

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,339
really kinda took a look at you know how

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,710
could I produce you know used five

00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,759
ferrars of marketing till now why is it

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,250
marketing till well I came from

00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,439
Salesforce before I was at try workers

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,180
so sometimes my Salesforce brain kicks

00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,909
in so work with me on this one and we'll

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:29,020
walk you through this so this is a very

00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:32,570
bland boring page that talks about and

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,649
1.1.1 I have some very bland boring text

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,560
here that doesn't really tell me much

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:37,640
how could I possibly use workers to

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,760
actually do something interesting with

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,370
this but what I really want to do is I

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,140
want to make it locally interesting and

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,810
I want to make the transfer work Network

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,870
and work for me so what I'm gonna do

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,089
here is I'm gonna build a worker to do a

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,699
couple of things

00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:57,759
I'm going to make sure I translate the

00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:59,379
copy for this marketing based on where I

00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,519
see the requests remember had ciphered

00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:02,559
works we've got points of presence

00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,839
everywhere we want workers everywhere

00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,829
says the requests come in I know where

00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,379
the requests are coming on so I'm gonna

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:11,230
translate it onto Matt I'm also gonna do

00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:13,600
something super interesting so I'm

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,100
actually going to wire in a whole set of

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,379
services to make it even more

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:21,069
interesting so the journey we're gonna

00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:22,720
go on here is we're gonna capture these

00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:24,610
requests coming in here so here you see

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,050
our worker on the left-hand side and

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,610
that's working when I deployed right

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,170
across the Tiber infrastructure so I

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,970
have a hundred and fifty two points of

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,490
presence what I'm going to do in this

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,589
worker is I'm gonna grab out request the

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,300
grab by HTTP request and I can see the

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:40,059
requests and response against the body

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,610
and you headers you name it and I'm

00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:44,889
going to determine what news articles

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,360
are relevant to where that workers

00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,089
running so if you're in Germany if

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,949
you're in Austria if you are in Brazil

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,110
or wherever else I'm going to grab some

00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:55,269
very locale specific news articles

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,040
figure out what the tone is I'm gonna

00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:59,079
use Watson to help me figure out what

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,420
that owner that is and then I'm gonna

00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:03,309
say ok let's go grab some market and

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,499
copy from Salesforce to figure out what

00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:08,649
is the right kind of copy I want to have

00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:10,360
on this ad on the others that marketing

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,100
page to figure out that would be and

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,809
then I'm gonna translate a bit of the

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,730
geo but you know what I'm a lazy

00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:17,529
marketer I don't want to do that all

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,110
those times I just want to write one

00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,059
page and deploy that I have all this

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,529
happen for me automatically and that's

00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:26,319
what we're able to do worker and this is

00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:28,990
what I think about you know direct trip

00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:31,420
and personalization of a worker so the

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,949
worker here as you can see is doing this

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,990
here and I'm happy to share this source

00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:37,749
code so people can see exactly what I'm

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,550
doing as I could do nice takeaway but an

00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:41,800
effect I'm ready to do in the Google

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:44,759
News search I'm looking at the tonal

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,679
analysis here I'm doing the translation

00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:50,980
etc etc but I can actually put Clive

00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,269
flowers work Network to work to actually

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,040
figure out where these requests are

00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,860
coming to and to figure out what

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,079
translate and how to translate so in the

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,819
interest of brevity you know I have a

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,259
couple of examples that I ran I arisin

00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:04,240
to use through a service called catch

00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:05,350
point which actually allows me to run

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,120
these request summer

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,670
the world and there ends up giving me

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,190
these copy directly translated that is

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,080
totally aware based on where the

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,950
requests are coming from so we got

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:21,880
English French if I remember this in

00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:24,970
Spanish I did Portuguese and German as

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,020
well all by one thing very small example

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:34,600
of what kip what's possible with workers

00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:36,430
okay let's keep going alright so I've

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,440
set up workers this is an amazing new

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,670
capability tour for building

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,890
infrastructure and innovation on the

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,440
edge but really the journey doesn't stop

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,340
here if I'm gonna build really great

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,740
apps

00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:52,030
I need amazing access to data it's not

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,700
access ability today but I need to do it

00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,680
in a way that's really really easy for

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,750
my developers but I've owned my own

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,430
personal journey here to think about now

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,040
as I did say I've been in the business a

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,940
few years so we're gonna take a trip

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,950
down memory lane

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,560
so I started my career at Sun

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,680
Microsystems who remembers son ok who's

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,560
written Java you know it's ok like Java

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,860
but I was the JDBC architect many years

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,660
ago at Sun Microsystems JDBC was the way

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,640
in which you talk to a database and

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,710
there's a bunch of standards wrote a

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,720
book my hot tip for you always never

00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,300
write a technical book don't do it it

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,650
has not in created my retirement plans

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:35,940
whatsoever but you know what we talked a

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:38,380
lot about what it was about to access

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,390
data in a way that was easy for our

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,710
customers then work for somebody called

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,150
progress software and I did the same

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,830
thing but I did across a variety of

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,470
different platforms and then at

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,300
Salesforce I thought about you know what

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,800
is the what is the importance of data so

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,420
those forces an entity is built

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,360
primarily in the Oracle database I

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,520
introduced HBase into Salesforce as our

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,130
Big Data data source and a whole set of

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,800
features fell out of that but you know

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:06,490
what what was more important was that we

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,310
built a set of a sort of infrastructures

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,470
that made it easy to interact with that

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,660
that data so what came out of Java JDBC

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,480
is I remember working on things like JDO

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,400
and hibernate with Salesforce we entered

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,300
just something called asynchronous so

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,170
called that allowed

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,970
to run queries in a reliable fashion

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,920
with Salesforce and then with tied fly

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,040
workers I'm faced with exactly the same

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,080
problem I need to have the right kind of

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,330
experience in order to interact with

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,350
data and I kind of let it the cat out of

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:40,750
the bag for us that's graph QL okay

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,450
so I'm really excited today to talk

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,459
about you know why graph QL is really

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,250
awesome sauce for us and for our

00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:49,899
developers and you know what we are

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,640
really really seeing and these are the

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,040
kind of the key kind of value props as

00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,019
you can see for graph QL when I came

00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,790
across the technology and I'm relatively

00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:00,730
new to to cloud fair and writing

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:03,760
JavaScript the edge I was like wow this

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,350
is amazing I wish I'd had this in my

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,820
previous life because I've gone this

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,519
we've gone crazy it would be a great

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,350
thing for us to do but for my

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,570
perspective from a cloud 4 perspective

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,300
is that today we're taught we wanted an

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,940
alliance at the beginnings of a new

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,140
partnership whereby cut and Paulo

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,690
graph QL and child 4 are going to be

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,880
coming together to you know build new

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,040
capabilities since that we can offer a

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,810
new way to interact with your data with

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,880
all the goodness that Apollo and graph

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,450
QL gives us and all the goodness that we

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,829
have with Type fire workers down the end

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,180
so our journey together is going to be

00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:39,850
and I'm moving pretty quickly I think

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,800
here is you know to build a universal

00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,079
graphical graphic API across the REST

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,190
API so that's where we are today and

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:50,380
we're right on the mark to be able to do

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,700
this and with the kind of capabilities

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,410
and packaging what we're talking about

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,300
is that we'll put you the ability to

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:58,060
take full advantage of cloud fur and

00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,010
really bring in any REST API resources

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,579
down on the end but it's only the

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,190
beginning

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:05,560
what is Clyde fair at its core it's a

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:10,329
set of different things in terms of

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:12,430
caching DDoS protection etc etc we're of

00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:14,829
our customers most important data it's

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,600
in our cache so we're also building the

00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:18,100
cache API as well that's something that

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,930
my team is working on right to second

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,240
and we hope to it to release that in the

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,680
third quarter of this year but again

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,920
this will be another iterative

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,279
capability that will offer on top of

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,260
Apolo as well and that is will be key in

00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,149
terms of you know really unlocking the

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,310
kind of capability that we see but it's

00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:38,139
only the beginning because down the path

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,000
even further we're thinking about what

00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:42,310
it means to have more persistent data on

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,440
the edge that's something you'll see us

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,269
talk about in the future or so but ever

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,000
preview there for you as well but

00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:50,649
consistent to it all is the pattern that

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,670
we get with this down the line

00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:56,290
