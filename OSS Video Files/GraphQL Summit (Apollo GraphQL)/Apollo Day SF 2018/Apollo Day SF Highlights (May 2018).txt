I couldn't be more excited it's been a

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,480
really exciting year for Apollo by far

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,740
the most momentum we've seen yet we're

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,870
at a point now where I can confidently

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,250
say without reservations you should

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,449
adopt this stuff it's gonna make your

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,400
life easier it's gonna make your apps

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,109
faster and your development experience

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,970
better the level of excitement among

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,789
native and web engineers to have Apollo

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,619
and graph QL live is just enormous when

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,289
I came across this technology and I was

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,180
like wow this is amazing I wish we'd

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,160
have had a politician a year ago it's

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,140
way easier for us now to integrate new

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,420
services and features the message is you

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,469
don't have to change your systems it's

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,640
the other way around

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,809
Apollo makes those things more valuable

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,700
there's a lot coming down the road map

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,559
that we're like super hungry takes be

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,899
exploring it's nice to see big companies

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,309
how they adopted a fuel which challenges

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,750
they've been facing and how they were

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,100
able to solve it you know that's the

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,320
whole kitchen sink kind of it just comes

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,329
with a lot of stuff that we need and we

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,800
don't have time to build ourselves it's

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,760
time to move the graphic you out and

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,949
this was like a really awesome

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,390
experience to like learn all about that

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,850
stuff we have been working with

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,189
CloudFlare on something which is a

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,500
building configuration of Apollo server

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,840
it's actually running inside cloud

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,520
fleurs Edge network hollow graph QL and

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,860
time for our gonna be coming together to

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,020
build new capabilities since that we can

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,670
offer a new way to interact with your

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,259
data we're super excited about that kind

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,220
of partnership but ultimately what we're

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,530
doing here is we're trying to build

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,970
something that everyone can use so they

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,049
can go back to building their things

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,170
that hopefully make the world a better

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,170
place

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,530
coming to Apollo days a great experience

00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,140
if you're just starting out with their

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,189
graphical experience if you're just

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,770
experimenting or if you're already in

00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:46,240
production learned a lot by listening to

00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,549
different presenters and especially

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,750
talking with Apollo members and other

00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:51,429
people who have done the same from

00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,289
different companies afterwards it's just

00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:54,130
a fun day I'm really excited about where

00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,380
it's all headed in

00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,450
you know eager to get started now is the

00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,789
time to be alive in the graphical world

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,280
so you know if you're not here you're in

00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:03,330
the wrong place

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,450
[Applause]

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,450
