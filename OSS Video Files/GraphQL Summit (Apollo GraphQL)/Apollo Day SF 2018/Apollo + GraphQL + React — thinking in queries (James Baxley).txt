	Talk from Apollo Day SF (May 31, 2018)

James Baxley, technical lead at Apollo, shows how GraphQL and Apollo bring simple, powerful patterns for data fetching and state management to React, replacing fragile code with elegant queries. See examples of server side rendering, error handling, pagination, local state management, advanced patterns like optimistic UI, data prefetching, and full-stack caching, and ways to use cutting edge React features like the new suspense API without writing a line of code.
