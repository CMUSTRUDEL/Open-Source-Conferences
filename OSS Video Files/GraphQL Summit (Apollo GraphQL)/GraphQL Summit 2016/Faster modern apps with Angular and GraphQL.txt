	Jeff Cross, Angular/Google and Uri Goldshtein, Apollo

We are seeing a new type of web app emerge that is faster and delightful to use. Angular 2 stable has been released and is built to support a new architecture for such apps from the ground up. But these apps (component based, extremely fast rendering, universal) require an updated best practices and a new approach to handling data. 

GraphQL clients, such as Apollo, are built to support more efficient client-server communications and are helping developers across different front-end frameworks use and share those best practices for data integration. In this talk, we'll demonstrate how Angular, GraphQL, and Apollo can be used together to easily build faster modern apps.
