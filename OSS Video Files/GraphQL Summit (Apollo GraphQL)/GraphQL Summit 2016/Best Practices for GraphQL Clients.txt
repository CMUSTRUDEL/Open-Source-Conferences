At Facebook, our GraphQL clients have evolved alongside the language for over 4 years. In this talk we'll explore the lessons we've learned in that time building GraphQL clients for Android, iOS, and JavaScript. We'll look at some missteps and some successes, and share the set of best practices that have emerged across these platforms.
