Title: GraphQL and Coursera & their API evolution
Publication date: 2016-11-02
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2016
Description: 
	Brennan Saeta, Coursera

Coursera’s educational platform has a broad API surface implemented in a standardized, sophisticated HTTP/JSON framework backed by a distributed microservice architecture. However, one of the biggest challenges engineers face is assembling all the data required to render the UI on both web and mobile clients. To radically improve our engineering velocity, we are migrating nearly 100% of our client data access to GraphQL. But we’re doing it WITHOUT throwing away our existing backend APIs, architecture, and tools. This talk will describe our approach to making every Coursera API available via GraphQL, with zero developer overhead.
