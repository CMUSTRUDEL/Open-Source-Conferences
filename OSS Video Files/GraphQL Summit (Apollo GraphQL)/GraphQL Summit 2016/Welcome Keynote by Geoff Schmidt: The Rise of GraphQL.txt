welcome to the first ever graphical

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,600
conference I see a lot of friends in the

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,389
audience I see a lot of new faces and

00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,160
I'm really grateful that so many of us

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,950
working together on graph QL are all

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,360
able to get to the other in one place

00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,619
the atmosphere atmosphere here has

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,330
really been electric this morning I've

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,890
just been getting so pumped talking to

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,070
people hearing about how using graph QL

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,010
and just seeing the excitement that

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,300
everyone seems to have my only regret

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,279
about this conference is that we didn't

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,370
run two tracks because we got so many

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,540
amazing talk submissions we easily could

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,820
have filled two tracks with great

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,430
speakers great material so that's

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,690
definitely something we'll fix next year

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,489
so apologies to the people that

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,700
submitted awesome talk proposals that we

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,140
just you know couldn't jam in in fact

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,390
the whole conference ended up like

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,460
almost twice as big as we planned we had

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,539
planned for we targeted 200 people we

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,820
thought that would be an awesome success

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,160
for the first graphical conference we

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,660
ended up cutting it a bit north of 350

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,199
when we just got to the point where like

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,550
logistics became overwhelming so that's

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,670
what the last couple months have been

00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:11,240
like for us so for the keynote I just

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,700
want to talk about the rise of graph QL

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:19,110
so rise of graph kills graph kill really

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,990
rising well spoiler yes the first piece

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,340
of evidence is is this conference not

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,470
only is it sold out and then some take a

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,360
look at some of the people that I was

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,659
able to fit on this slide before I ran

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,509
of space this is a who's who of the tech

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,310
of great tech companies and I apologize

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,229
to be left if I left you off bone of the

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,920
slide it was just you know too many too

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,430
many great companies but digging a

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,979
little deeper

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,189
another question we could ask is who's

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,829
hiring for graph QL and earlier this

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,869
year we took a look at that so and we

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,240
just pulled all the graph QL jobs posts

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,920
we could find on you know the various

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,149
job sites around the internet and we

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,890
found dozens and dozens of companies

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,450
somewhat to our surprise even a couple

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,520
months ago that we're already posting

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,840
positions for graphical indicating that

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,540
they'd already gone through the cycle of

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,369
trying graph QL liking it and getting to

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,509
the point where they are you know have

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,819
valid enough that they're now hiring

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,770
against it so this is a small but

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,720
representative sample and the main thing

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,990
I want to illustrate here is that graph

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,200
QL span

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:22,900
company sizes like it spans it spans

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,610
industries you see it being adopted at

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,710
small startups are just getting started

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,470
but also maybe even more strongly you

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,500
see it being adopted at large companies

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,970
with very sophisticated IT departments

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,590
because graphical can deliver so much

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,070
value in that environment that it's it's

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:41,710
worth investigating this new technology

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:43,300
and ok so how about the ecosystem how

00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,790
about the open source ecosystem around

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,530
graph QL well how about this if you

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,020
search for graph 2 on github you find

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,640
over 2000 repositories and his this

00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,150
isn't repositories that are using graph

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,740
QL

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,850
this is repositories that are called

00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,890
graph QL like these these are like

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,300
different projects and connectors and

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,920
add-ons and modules for graph QL and

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:10,120
speaking a good hub most people here

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,920
probably know that just last month graph

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,730
kill itself made the news when they

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,650
announced that they are moving their

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,210
public API over to graphical or adding a

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,720
public graphical API next to the REST

00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:22,150
API which is huge it's it's a big

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,770
milestone for graph QL and I can't share

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,390
the details but I know of at least two

00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,730
other big names that are planning to

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,800
launch major public graphical API is in

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,910
the next year so it's it's a it's a

00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,620
first data point not a last data point

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,930
this is a this is a screenshot from the

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,130
recent angular connect conference the

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,410
the big conference in the angular

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,540
ecosystem and this is a member of the

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,890
angular core team talking about how to

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,300
do data fetching and angular and angular

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,300
point of view on data fetching and the

00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,250
first thing on the slide is graph QL

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,990
they even invited Apollo's own regaled

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,970
shine who's speaking later today on

00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,770
stage during the keynote to talk about

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,270
it so what you learn from that is that

00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,850
they consider data fetching to be

00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,020
important and they see graph QL as a

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,070
viable way to do that that they're

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,660
comfortable putting in front of the

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,620
angular community and in a pretty high

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:12,370
profile talk and just one more proof

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,360
point here we did a survey of some of

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,310
the larger companies some of the

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,989
enterprises that are at the conference

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,450
here today in advance the conference to

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:21,609
make sure we're meeting your needs one

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,410
of the things we asked was how important

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:27,669
will Graf kill be to your organization

00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:30,289
in 2017 and almost on a scale of 0 to

00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,479
100 almost half of the respond

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:35,719
it's said that it would be 100 out of

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,430
100 mission-critical in 2017 so that's

00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:38,689
the sentiment that we're seeing at least

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,639
among conference attendees which is

00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:44,360
obviously a biased sample I'd like to

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,520
say a visionary sample of a vendor price

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,949
sentiment so let's add all that up

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,990
we've got growing use by leading

00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,800
companies we've got a large open source

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,309
ecosystem

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,779
we've got adoption by major public api's

00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:58,430
we've got the endorsements from the view

00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,499
layers especially on the JavaScript side

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,149
like angle and react and we're also

00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:05,360
starting to see this mission-critical

00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:07,279
enterprise sign it so what I get from

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,319
this is that we shouldn't be thinking

00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,669
about graph fuels a piece of software we

00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,289
should be thinking about graphic well as

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:14,479
the beginning of a big movement in the

00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:16,669
industry like containerization or Big

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,409
Data so I'll talk a little bit more

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,360
about that later

00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:23,569
but first let me tell you about

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,399
something I believe I believe it's

00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:27,740
possible make developer tools much

00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:30,289
better than they are today not just a

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,879
little bit better but much better so

00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,919
much better that they unlock new

00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:38,089
opportunities for people all over the

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,979
world and some years ago I and a couple

00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,419
friends started a company called meteor

00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,919
development group around these beliefs

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,870
that's the company that's hosting us

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,729
today and we started out by building

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,399
meteor j/s the full stack JavaScript

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:51,080
framework that was a that's been an

00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,360
amazing experience it's grown to become

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,399
a top 20 project on github and that's

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,899
like really fun professionally but the

00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,709
thing that was really exciting to me

00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,629
about it

00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:01,759
is that it proved to me that it's

00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:03,349
possible to build really powerful dev

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,119
tools that can advance the state of the

00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:06,649
art but more importantly than that they

00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:08,509
could make a big difference in real

00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:09,949
people's lives when we just you know see

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,559
the impact that good developers can have

00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,769
on people so we've now been in the open

00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:16,789
source business for over five years and

00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:19,550
you know for all the reasons I just

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,719
presented to you and a dozen more we

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,029
think that graph fuels the next big

00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:24,110
thing and we think that it's the biggest

00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:27,169
way that we can help advance app

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,639
development so building great graphical

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:30,280
tools and libraries has become our main

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,710
focus

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,730
I don't think we're the only ones or you

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:39,460
know we'll be the only ones in the

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:40,990
future so you know what's why is gravity

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,450
also exciting like where did this come

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:48,669
from how did this happen

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:49,900
you know graph QL one of the challenges

00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:51,430
sometimes in talking about graph QL is

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,889
there's this laundry list of benefits

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,810
and you know sometimes people say well

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,800
they're kind of synergistic you know you

00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,740
get a little bit this a little bit of

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,880
that in all it's a great solution but I

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,290
think there's a way to distill it down

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,580
even though it's not going to perfectly

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,460
capture the whole graphical value

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,090
proposition and that's that I think

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,710
graph QL at its core is really the first

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,990
good solution to what you might call the

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,150
data loading problem so here's the data

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,940
loading problem you've got a ton of

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,380
services in the cloud you know we've

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,760
we've had this amazing explosion of

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,870
cloud computing it's becoming easier and

00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,630
easier to stand up a service in the

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,830
cloud so many tools to do this and also

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,630
so many services that are already

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,250
available to us it's getting so easy to

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,110
scale these services and they're just

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,590
like multiplying like bunny rabbits and

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:37,990
then we've got all these great apps and

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,460
the apps are running on our phones and

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,510
our pockets they're running on our

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,979
watches they're running on our

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,750
thermostats they're running in the

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,400
dashboard of our cars they're even

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,930
running in our web browser now that the

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,970
web browser has actually grown up from

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,380
being a hypertext viewer like this

00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,580
vision of the world's library the

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,650
universal library right into the

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,729
universal app platform so I've got all

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,729
these apps on the edge of the network

00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:59,229
that give us the possibility of like

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,460
reaching us at every point in our life

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,180
where we might want to have access to

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,919
all these services but all that's

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,350
useless if those parts can't talk to

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,400
each other if those clients can't talk

00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,330
to the cloud services you know it's you

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,650
know you just playing games on your

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,840
phone like it's it's a whole whole

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,070
different value proposition so in the

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,260
past this wasn't a big problem because

00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,180
the apps were pretty simple in

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,740
particular we mostly used to use this

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,870
architecture if you go back five or ten

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,340
years where you just had this app the

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,900
app was the process on your server we

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,729
didn't even think about installable apps

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,219
on your devices the app was the process

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:35,289
on the server and it talked to a

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,729
database and then it pushed HTML down to

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,960
the client so there was no data loading

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,150
problem because it's just a process

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,430
talking to a database but now what's

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,789
happened is things have gotten much more

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,889
complicated

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,600
so any given screen in your app might

00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:49,850
have a hundred pieces of data on it like

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,579
or more and all those pieces of data

00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,500
might be coming from a different place

00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:56,329
and you need to pull all that data in a

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,639
single round-trip or you're gonna have

00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:00,230
bad performance you need to fetch only

00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,610
the data you actually need you can't

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,740
over fetch data because that will also

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,980
kill performance especially on wireless

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,420
mobile networks and you don't just have

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,519
one app you probably have a couple apps

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,230
and maybe you've got the iOS on the

00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,329
Android version or maybe you've got the

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,279
version for your users and the verse

00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,120
interior admins or maybe you're a market

00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,040
you've got the two sides of the

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,089
marketplace however many apps you have

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,180
right now you're probably gonna have

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:25,819
more apps if we look forward to year two

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,990
and likewise however many back-end

00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:28,220
services you have you're probably gonna

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,810
have more of them if we look forward a

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,000
couple of years

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,670
and what's more your app really isn't

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,069
based on screens anymore it's probably

00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,060
based on reusable UI components or

00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:40,699
that's probably where you're trying to

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,500
go that you're constantly recombining in

00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:45,290
different ways so you can rapidly roll

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,980
out new features so now you've got this

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:50,569
situation where you've got you have this

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,980
data fetching problem where you have to

00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:53,389
fetch a whole bunch of data from a lot

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,889
of different places it needs to be

00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:56,720
exactly the right data it needs to be

00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:58,610
highly performant and you need to do it

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,529
even as the app landscape is changing

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,360
the service landscape is changing and

00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:08,329
the features in your app is also

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:11,360
changing so Intergraph cool so graph QL

00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:14,120
is the first true comprehensive solution

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,769
to that data loading problem and it's

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,690
proven at scale and it has support from

00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:19,399
across the industry and that's what's

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,560
driven I think this whole explosion of

00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:25,100
interest there's been a lot of attempts

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,240
to solve this problem in the past but

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,220
graphical is the one that's gotten

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,769
traction and it's kind of interesting to

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,810
think about that you know there's been

00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:34,910
many common many tools many products

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,500
many approaches to like that are all

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,120
basically feeling around this like where

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,149
where's how's my back-end gonna talk to

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,519
my front end and I think that the reason

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:47,029
why graph QL got here is a combination

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,000
of three factors openness flexibility

00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:51,050
and power and it just kind of hits the

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,860
sweet spot between those three

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:56,899
considerations so it's open gut feels

00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,449
open because it's not a piece of

00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:02,180
software it's a specification so right

00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:03,589
away that means that it's possible for

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,850
an ecosystem to grow up around graph

00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:06,170
Gill and infer to serve lots of

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,309
different needs and I think that's like

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,379
the first thing that graphical got

00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:11,209
really right that a lot of the previous

00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:12,829
attempts at solving this you know it's

00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:16,639
natural you you have a problem you want

00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:17,809
to build a tool for it but I think you

00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,339
know the the first thing that's really

00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,730
correct about graph kills for a bunch of

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,119
reasons

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:26,179
it's a specification first the second

00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:27,769
thing is that it's flexible because it's

00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,209
not coupled to any particular language

00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,189
it's not coupled to any particular

00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:33,259
database it's not coupled to any

00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:35,300
particular hosting environment and what

00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,699
that means is no matter what your

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,589
environment is you can easily add graph

00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:42,379
QL to that environment at least if

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:45,980
you've got the right tooling with you

00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:47,720
and finally it's powerful I mean we we

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,670
can say powerful in the lowercase sense

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,990
just in the sense that it lets me do

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,490
more things than other tools got more

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,279
features but I think there's also a

00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,139
powerful in a capital sense and I think

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,040
the the power from graphical really

00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:00,439
comes from the fact that it's

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,029
declarative or to put a different way

00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:04,579
instead of writing code you write

00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:06,259
queries and this was the big insight in

00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,189
the 70s that brought relational

00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,709
databases right

00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:11,360
like before sequel you still had

00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,519
databases where you got a database was

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,379
you hired a database PhD and they wrote

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,529
you a database your query planner was a

00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:20,209
human being and then there was this

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,699
insight well wait a second if we make

00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:23,809
databases if we put query a query engine

00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:25,160
in front of our database so I can just

00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,319
type a query and that query

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,699
declaratively specifies what I want then

00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,249
the database engine can get better and

00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:32,089
better at fulfilling that query

00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,679
thankfully I don't think this problem is

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,089
as hard as complicated or is in need of

00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,149
amazing query engines as a database

00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:40,249
thankfully but I think the insight is

00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:42,199
basically the same which is when you go

00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:45,079
to a declarative way of approaching

00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,689
problems sometimes it lets you move

00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,629
complexity out of your codebase and into

00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:51,740
your tooling and the consequence in

00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:53,389
graph kills case and moving that

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,759
complexity out of your codebase and into

00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:57,379
your tooling means that you can achieve

00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,209
really high levels of performance really

00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:01,910
high levels of security really high

00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:03,139
levels of correctness and you can do

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,309
that with confidence across your whole

00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,870
codebase because you know it's being

00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:08,089
done the same way each time because it's

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,270
in the tooling not in the code and you

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:13,360
can do it with minimum effort because

00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,620
toolings doing the work not you so I

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,020
think those are the three things

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,300
openness flexibility and power and

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,360
because it's grab cold like just at the

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,980
right Venn diagram of these things in

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,560
less than a year it's managed to emerge

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,960
as the de facto right pattern for data

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,960
loading as far as I can tell certainly

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,540
but there's a little bit more here which

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,220
is you know you could hear all that and

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,520
think about graphed well is a library or

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,750
piece of software but really I think

00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,890
once you've been using graph tool for a

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,800
little while you discover there's

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,540
something more to it which is graphical

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,330
changes graphical gives you the

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,180
opportunity to change the process you

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,440
have for writing software and I've heard

00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,270
some people start to call this graph

00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,430
tool first or a graphical first approach

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,870
and I think you can put this on a pretty

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,000
big heading like the you know the

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,910
there's a lot of positive changes that

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,190
introduces let me give you let me give

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:12,850
you an example so it github is a good

00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:15,450
example most of you heard about the good

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,710
hubs awesome public graphical API but

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,560
github doesn't just use graphical for

00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,630
their public API instead they are now

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,740
they have a new orientation and I think

00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,300
they'll be more about this later so I've

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,460
gotten wrong I think there's a talk

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,080
where where it can be corrected when

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,260
they build the new feature they build

00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,730
the graphical API first and then their

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,620
front-end developers build the UI for

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,750
that feature on top of the graphical API

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,950
and that has a lot of benefits because

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,470
it knows you have a really consistent

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,030
and clean API for the feature it also

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,440
means in good up's case that they can

00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,880
take that feature and bring it to all

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,440
their partners everyone that building on

00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,600
top of the github API at the same time

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,800
as it's available internally and they

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,450
can have feature parity between that

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,290
external API net internal API which is a

00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:59,170
pretty cool use case if you're good hub

00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,850
so but this this approach you know so

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,560
this this is my very high-level diagram

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,780
of like graphical first and the main

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,910
idea here is you put a graphical schema

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,750
at the center of your feature at the

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,000
center of the feature you're developing

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,170
and maybe you work from the from the

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,600
schema out and it's going to have

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,820
different realizations for different

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,650
teams if you go this way and like like I

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,060
said this is totally separate from the

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,080
tooling like you could totally disagree

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,250
with everything I'm saying it's all of a

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,260
great time with graph kill but I just

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,340
want to see this idea

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,630
we've been building our products graft

00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,430
kill first now we talked to a lot of

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,570
people that have as well let me tell you

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,880
about some of the benefits we're seeing

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,070
one thing that's really cool is that the

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,750
client developers and the service

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,370
developers can work independently so

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,540
you're building a new feature you can

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,300
write down what the scheme is going to

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,890
be and then the client teams can work

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,940
with a mock schema there's even some

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,260
cool tooling out there that will take

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,120
your graphical scheme and automatically

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,800
generate mocks for it there you go they

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,810
can go build the front-end in one of the

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,010
service team can go build the services

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:57,020
and test against that graphical API and

00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,490
then you can meet in the middle with

00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,320
much higher confidence that you would

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,720
have had in the past that it's going to

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,860
work when you put the pieces together it

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,090
also means you can easily add new

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,800
clients so if today you've got a you've

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,480
got a swift client on the front end and

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,100
you've got some services on the back end

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,690
and later you want to add an android

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,310
client or you want to add a website

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,320
that's based on javascript you can

00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,390
easily add these new clients you can

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,860
even decide hey I want to move from I'm

00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,530
ready to move from Swift to react NATO

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,700
for example I'm ready to try that out

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,500
you can make all those changes and

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,120
because everything sitting on top of

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,590
that schema you don't even have to talk

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,020
to the service team in the perfect world

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,730
or if you do you can it's a lot less

00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,710
work that needs to be done because you

00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,470
have Strack 'td you abstract it like

00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,810
your front end from your back end and

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,760
and likewise on the back end you've got

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,300
a ton of flexibility you can use lots of

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,350
different languages you can start with a

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,020
monolithic back-end and you can refactor

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,880
into micro services you know so getting

00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,020
on the graph QL is a great choice if you

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,030
think that in the future you want to go

00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,280
that route from monolithic to micro

00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,470
services and it's also a great fit from

00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,180
component oriented design where you

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,650
embed the data dependencies have every

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,720
come every component in the component

00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,100
itself because it lets you get away from

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,540
this model where I had to wait a refs

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,830
query for each page in my application

00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,110
and feed the data into the components

00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:14,000
now the components can just carry their

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,800
queries with them and you know the

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,530
graphical tooling solves the problem of

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,940
you know fetching what you need and the

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,350
best news about all this is it's really

00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,160
easy to get started with graphical first

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:29,660
design and across the ecosystem what

00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,980
we've seen is people we've seen more

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,090
than anything else is people adding its

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,310
production apps that are already at

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,140
scale and what they do is they go

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,710
graphical first on just one feature it's

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,059
like my next

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,990
sure I'm gonna try this like graphical

00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,309
based approach maybe you call it

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,659
graphical first maybe just call it using

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,950
graph QL

00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,899
I'll get that introduction I'll see how

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,159
it goes and then they do another feature

00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:50,120
and then maybe they do another feature

00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:51,830
whatever pace they want and often what

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,270
they find is the benefits of graphic QL

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,789
are compelling enough that it turns into

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,320
a conversation about you know moving

00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:58,460
more of the new future development over

00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,840
to graphical but the cool thing is you

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:05,350
can go at your own pace you can taste it

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,350
you can see is this good is it for us so

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,580
let's talk about the ecosystem that's

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,500
developing around this who's working on

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,049
graphic and graph QL and graph Gill

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,270
first a ton of stuff like look at this

00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:19,130
like this is the awesome graphical

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,470
awesome project if you want to go check

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,789
out all these links there's been a ton

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,039
of open source projects and open source

00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:27,649
work already it's been an incredibly

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:33,440
fertile area and I think it's only gonna

00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:36,320
accelerate so with that said I really

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,740
believe in graphical first and making it

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,230
the you know doing our part to make it

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,880
the new way people build apps because I

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,039
believe in the possibility of a better

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,210
developer experience so if I may be so

00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,289
bold I want to just take a minute to

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,640
talk about some of the stuff that we're

00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:54,200
doing at meteor and Apollo so we call

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
our work collectively Apollo that's kind

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,870
of our brand for a collection of tools

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,120
on libraries and our idea here is that

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:05,299
you can take these pieces you can

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,500
combine them with with each other you

00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:08,570
can combine with anything in the

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,070
graphical ecosystem to build the ideal

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,779
graphical setup for your particular use

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,279
case or you can use them one-on-one

00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,380
individually just the ideas they are

00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:20,870
high-quality pieces of independent

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:22,789
technology and I think of the Apollo you

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:26,090
know umbrella here as standing for three

00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:28,490
things first of all 100% spec compliant

00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,659
graph QL it's just a great graphical

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,580
implementation so that means you're not

00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:32,809
locked into anything we want to follow

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,789
the standard we want to help push the

00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:36,590
standard forward but we think that the

00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:38,480
way forward for graph QL should be based

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,610
on really strong Interop and like you

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,779
know really strong community discussions

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,889
around the standards and really good

00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:48,350
tooling that is based on those ideas

00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:50,240
second and really most importantly it's

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,920
built as a community collaboration

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,090
and what that means to me is we all work

00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,520
together to figure out what graph Gail

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,620
needs next but more than just talking

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,830
about it we actually work together to

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,850
build it collaboratively and I think

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,760
that that's a great way to make sure

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,170
that every feature we roll out is

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,820
actually addressing the real production

00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,260
needs faced by real users because I

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,630
think with an exciting technology like

00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,800
this that's new so much of the stuff is

00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,150
information it's coming in from the

00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,679
field as people try building these apps

00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,700
and closing that feedback loop like what

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,809
are you experiencing what do you want

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:23,840
next that's the way we build great tools

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:26,600
and finally the pieces are designed to

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,040
stand alone but we also want to make

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,200
sure that for people that choose to use

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,820
one or more of the pieces we can certify

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,670
that they work well together and

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,140
interoperate so the vision here is as

00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,670
more of these pieces grow you know if

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,679
you want you know something where the

00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,600
pieces are have been tested together by

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,770
you know a group of people you have that

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,390
option but if you want to pull it apart

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,330
use the pieces independently that's also

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:51,620
something you can do so I've got three

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:54,440
big Apollo announcements today first I

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,910
am very excited to announce that the

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,790
JavaScript version the Apollo client is

00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,650
leaving technical preview so earlier

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,900
this year we talked with a lot of people

00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,309
are on the ecosystem basically everyone

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,590
we could find who is using graph QL and

00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:07,880
one of the things that you told this is

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,880
about what you want in a graphical

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,990
client so we heard you want a client

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,290
that works with whatever technology

00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,540
you're already using be that Redux or

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:20,660
angular or react or any other front-end

00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:22,850
it shouldn't require you to change your

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:25,820
tooling in order to get on the graph

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:28,130
guilt rain second you wanted it to be

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,870
really easy to understand how it works

00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,010
and you want it to be really easy to be

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,610
able to contribute to the open-source

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:36,710
project but at the same time it's also a

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,750
requirement that it not sacrifice any of

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,790
the full power of graph QL so it's got

00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,590
to strike this balance between not being

00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,590
a black box like understanding the parts

00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,030
that are inside but also being able to

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,050
do all the stuff that you can do with

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,790
graphical and not feel like you've

00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,260
accepted a limitation or given up you

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,630
know some big function of graphical and

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,640
I think what we've found is that is in

00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,230
fact eminently possible in fact it gets

00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,150
easier the more people are able to

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,919
understand the model of what the clients

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,270
actually doing and third you wanted

00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,159
excellent Docs

00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,590
so the rolls results of those

00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:11,159
conversations has been the JavaScript

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:13,919
version of Apollo client and with over

00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,380
100 contributors from many people in

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,390
this room including leading graphical

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:22,289
companies like Credit Karma and Coursera

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:24,360
I am I think it's really living up to

00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:28,740
its motto by the community for the

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,059
community and what's more Apollo clients

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,309
already leading the way with advanced

00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:34,049
features like graphical subscriptions we

00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,610
should reshape subscription for support

00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,409
I think just a couple weeks ago now and

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,760
there's already multiple implementations

00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:40,890
of subscriptions for different backends

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,240
and databases and what's really exciting

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,950
about those is they're coming out of

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,450
people's actual experiences like what

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,130
back-end do you want for subscriptions

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,179
how am I gonna integrate with Redis how

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,960
am I going to enjoy it with Postgres

00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,539
like what do you need in your

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,270
environment and there's more to come

00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:56,909
after subscriptions I think a lot of us

00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,020
can see all the power and excitement in

00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:00,059
some of the future graphical features

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,130
that we're looking at and we're gonna

00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,960
keep on trying to bring those things to

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,029
Apollo client and have it be based on

00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,440
the actual contributions actual

00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:08,549
production needs of the people that are

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,130
out there in production with Apollo

00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:15,270
client so I just want to thank everyone

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,200
in the audience who's been a part of

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,159
this it's been a huge collaboration and

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,480
it's really exciting that was graphic

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,600
you leaving technical preview a month

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,190
ago we're already now able to bring a

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,610
public client that same production seal

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,870
of approval and it's been an incredible

00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,220
community collaboration and we're gonna

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:34,710
make this the template for everything we

00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,789
do under the Apollo banner so could we

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,929
have a round of applause for everyone's

00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,929
who contributed to Apollo client

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,240
and I want to make it clear we don't see

00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,220
this is the only graphical client

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,200
it is something we built with a group of

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,880
people and we think it can help a lot of

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,100
people move forward but I think that the

00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,900
way to make graphical strong is to have

00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,070
multiple clients and a lot of different

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,950
points of view a lot of different

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,600
languages a lot of different ideas that

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,550
is the case of every vibrant open source

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,320
ecosystem so I don't want anyone to get

00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,090
the impression that you know this is

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,679
like the only graphical client that we

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,910
would ever endorse or recommend I think

00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,730
there's a lot of fantastic stuff out

00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,080
there the best ones probably yet to be

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,640
written

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,710
second though I'm equally excited to

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,170
announce the first native mobile version

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:25,110
of Apollo client so this is Apollo

00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:27,030
client for Swift and we heard loud and

00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,260
clear that there's a lot of people to

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,690
want to use graph queue on their native

00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,160
mobile applications and that when you do

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,660
that you should have a graphical

00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,100
experience that feels right at home in

00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,020
the workflow of a developer that's

00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:40,200
working in both you know working in iOS

00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,240
working in Xcode so I'm gonna spend less

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,240
time on this because it's at an earlier

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,520
stage but take a look at this you know

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,480
this early preview of Apollo client for

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:55,170
Swift and I think what this really shows

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,020
is the power of graph Cal for mobile

00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,309
development and you know from the

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,990
screencap you can already see some of

00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:02,940
the reasons why I like what you're gonna

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,770
see here is when you delete you know

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,660
you've got your queries you've got your

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:09,510
schema and your code side by side and

00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,929
when you delete a field from the schema

00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,970
you see the compile error in your code

00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:17,580
because we're able to generate from your

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,870
schema from your queries a set of swift

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,820
types that are even specific to each

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,650
query and we're able to give you inline

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,050
feedback about you know whether using

00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:27,210
graphical correctly and you know whether

00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,290
all the types are checking out we're

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,030
able to do auto-completion

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,910
Raible the you know inline the compiler

00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:35,010
errors and and you know we've been

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,270
hearing from the folks at Facebook for a

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,010
long time that the original motivation

00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,120
for graphical was all the power that

00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,150
they could get for native mobile

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,300
development so I'm really excited to

00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:47,010
work together with you know everyone who

00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,570
wants to contribute we already have some

00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,700
great contributors and great

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:53,999
contributions from developers at

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,029
companies you've all heard of too

00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:58,669
build this out into the best native

00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:01,409
mobile graphical experience it can be

00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:03,809
and to bring it to Android and Objective

00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:04,950
C we've already had contributions that

00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:07,169
are started the starting point for both

00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:13,129
of those languages and we'd love to have

00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:14,970
your help too and one more thing I'm

00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:16,229
really excited to announce something

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:20,220
we've been working hard on for a long

00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:22,019
time which is meteor development group's

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,769
first ever commercial product for graph

00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:27,450
QL and the background here is over and

00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:29,519
over again talking developers we've

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:32,299
heard two things first of all there's a

00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:35,009
real need for production grade

00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,869
instrumentation to understand the

00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:38,159
performance of you know how your app is

00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:39,840
actually performing in practice because

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,519
a lot of the tools that you probably use

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,289
before with the rest you might see all

00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,999
of your graphical traffic showing up as

00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:46,950
like one endpoint called slash graphic

00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:48,299
you L when there is it should be the

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,769
opposite you should have so much better

00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,090
visibility because we've got so much

00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:54,419
great information like with all this

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:57,029
typing the second thing is it extends

00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,859
beyond performance there's a huge

00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:01,080
opportunity to use graphical to get more

00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,700
insight into how your clients are

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,820
actually using your API and how your

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:10,590
clients are actually using your app data

00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:12,899
so I am really excited to announce our

00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,299
attempt to deliver on the first little

00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:18,450
bit of each of those value propositions

00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,229
which is called Apollo optics and here

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,080
it is

00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:23,399
Apollo optics is designed to be what you

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,220
need to go into production with

00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:27,330
confidence with graph QL and it's built

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,190
from the ground up not just to give you

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,309
that confidence but to help you get

00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:35,989
maximum value out of your graphical use

00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:38,999
so what obstacle e gives you two views

00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:40,529
there's one view that's a view of so you

00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:42,599
can see you know I guess we can start

00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:45,570
here there's a scheme of view that gives

00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:47,359
you insight into how your apps are okay

00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,409
I'm not gonna try to sync to the video

00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,599
there's a steam of you the schema view

00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:53,519
shows you let's take a look at my schema

00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,320
let's take a look at like which clients

00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,299
are using which fields and how much and

00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,309
that's really useful if you're saying I

00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,989
want to deprecate this field but some

00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:02,249
some client is still querying it which

00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:03,480
client is still clearing it what do I

00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:06,990
need to do if I want to deprecate this

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,280
field and the for example and the other

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,260
view as a performance view and the

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,450
performance view gives you a field by

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,820
field resolver by resolve or breakdown

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:17,309
of exactly what each query is costing

00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,020
and how its assembled and how that's

00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:21,809
distributed and how that's changing over

00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,820
time so you can see hey occasionally

00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:25,710
this query takes way too long oh yeah

00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,600
it's because occasionally this server

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,190
ends up blocking all the graphical

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,590
resolution when it takes too long to

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,570
respond or you can say I thought that

00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,790
would be fast it's actually slow and you

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,350
can discover hey that's because I

00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,080
thought it was going to get paralyzed

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,970
but it's actually running in serial so

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,150
it gives you that insight to understand

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,130
what's really going on and the reason

00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,240
I'm so excited about this is I think

00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,490
it'll help more people get into

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,840
production with graphical faster and I

00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,750
also think it'll help make the case of

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,880
the value for graph kill beyond you know

00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,679
beyond dis performance so the nitty

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,330
gritty it works with real a it works

00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,620
with Apollo client works a thermograph

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,270
kill it works with anything you want to

00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,140
throw at it

00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:06,450
that's the Apollo philosophy

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:09,000
independently design parts that oh hey

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,429
that wasn't supposed to happen the work

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,800
to get together the work rate alone that

00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:15,660
also work great together the one hitch

00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,910
is it does need a server-side agent to

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,590
collect some of the data right now what

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,020
we have is a JavaScript agent that works

00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,480
with I think just about every JavaScript

00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,850
server that anyone's using in production

00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,470
but we also have a beta version of the

00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,390
Ruby agent thanks to some awesome

00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,900
community contributions thank you very

00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,100
much and that's great because we know

00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,140
that there many people who want to use

00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,640
this in your graphical rails app which

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,210
is already emerged as like a really

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,350
common graphical use case and we want

00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,270
everyone to use it so we've gotten to

00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,650
really attract at this point we've

00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,390
thrown in a two week free trial and

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,450
we're giving demos upstairs if any wants

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:54,030
to give it addressed on that test drive

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:57,870
so my biggest message from all of that

00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:59,400
is we're here to help we want to see the

00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,510
world go graph kill first and we want to

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,309
do whatever we can to help make that

00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:07,500
happen so we're gonna keep on trying to

00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:09,390
listen trying to help organize around

00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,280
whatever the gaps are in the whole graph

00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,360
kill first story

00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:15,120
we're gonna keep collaborating with all

00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,860
of you and beyond software to the

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,110
training yesterday so load on the flash

00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,820
a lot of people had to be turned away so

00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,930
we're gonna look to see if we can help

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,890
get some more trainings organized

00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:26,340
because you know that's important to

00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,810
some people to many people and we're

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,180
also announcing today a graphical

00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:31,590
support program so for those of you that

00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,270
want a commercial vendor relationship

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,470
with us or they just want to pick our

00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,400
brains about what we've learned from

00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,260
talking to a lot of people in the

00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:43,200
ecosystem we can we can provide that

00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:45,000
service to you so the let's take a quick

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
look forward to 2017 where's graphic

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,700
we're gonna go in 2017

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,710
I think 2017 is going to be the year

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,290
that graphical goes from a technology to

00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,450
a movement I think we're gonna see

00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:56,760
hundreds of new graphical projects and

00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,050
libraries that are pretty useful I mean

00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,900
we already have hundreds so maybe that

00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:03,080
number should be higher thousands of new

00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,920
jobs requiring graphical of skills

00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,040
there's going to be an opportunity for

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,300
hundreds of consultancies hundreds of

00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,710
training companies to offer their

00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,540
graphical skills and knowledge to the

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,100
marketplace as we take literally

00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,450
millions of developers you know if it

00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,750
gets as big as I think it might and

00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,950
onboard them onto graph QL you know

00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,480
we're gonna see a new generation of

00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,630
graphical first product companies so

00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,120
we've seen reindex scaffold graph cool

00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:30,300
and now Apollo optics there's gonna be a

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,350
lot more I think and the other big thing

00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,180
is I think we're going to see some more

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:36,180
big public API zhan graphical and that's

00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,410
gonna be rocket fuel because you know

00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,300
think about it it could be the most

00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,670
powerful vector for developer adoption

00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,080
that's ever happened because if you're a

00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,520
developer like I mean you spend most of

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,010
your day as a developer looking at api's

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,690
and if every API you look at is talking

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,520
about hey here you can try it with graph

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,170
QL and you try it with graphical which

00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,800
is really easy if it's a public API and

00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,460
you'll like it

00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,050
that's gonna expose this idea and this

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,170
way of development to so many people so

00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:06,060
quickly so I think it's gonna be a

00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:07,410
really exciting year so if you've been

00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,030
working on graph field for a while now

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,850
or if this is your first time checking

00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,410
it out either way I hope you'll take a

00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,270
look around the room and feel pride

00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:19,110
about what we've built and what we can

00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:20,730
build together this is an awesome day we

00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,320
have a lot of the you know top people in

00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,180
the graphic community in one room it's

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,910
an awesome opportunity to learn from

00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,470
each other to share your experiences if

00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,910
you're farther along you know maybe pay

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,020
it forward and help someone who's just

00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,030
getting started

00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,250
you know you have a chance to make

00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,750
connections here that are going to lead

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,220
to the next great open-source project or

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,450
even the next graphical company or

00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,940
they're going to help you make the case

00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,760
for graphical and organization help you

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,220
ship features faster there's so many

00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,270
ways to get involved and I just think

00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,030
there's a huge opportunity in front of

00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,320
us so most of all though I want to thank

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:55,200
you for coming I want to thank you for

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,790
your contributions graph QL going from a

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,400
specification to everything that we saw

00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:01,920
in this first couple slides is largely

00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,030
due to the efforts of people in this

00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,030
room and a few people that couldn't be

00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,470
here so let's be excited about that and

00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,210
let's take a deep breath let's enjoy

00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,560
today and let's get excited for the next

00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,560
