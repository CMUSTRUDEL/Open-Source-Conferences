Title: Navigating Your Transition to GraphQL
Publication date: 2016-11-02
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2016
Description: 
	Sashko Stubailo and Danielle Man, Apollo 

We've seen countless examples of how GraphQL makes it easier to organize, maintain, and use APIs. If you’re building with it today, over a year after it was initially released, you can benefit from the experience of many teams that came before you. You can also leverage the wide array of tools built by the community to make it easier to adopt GraphQL alongside technologies you’re already using. In this talk, we’ve distilled lessons and architectural patterns from top companies, the open source community, and our own production apps to help you embark on your GraphQL journey.
