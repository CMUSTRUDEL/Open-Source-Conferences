	Lee Byron, GraphQL/Facebook

GraphQL has been in use at Facebook for over four years and evolved a lot before it was open sourced. During that time we learned a lot about what works and why, and derived a series of best practices. Hopefully our best practices and lessons learned are relevant not only to your use of GraphQL, but how you design and build all sorts of software.
