Title: GraphQL at Shopify
Publication date: 2016-11-04
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2016
Description: 
	Marc-Andr√© Giroux and Dylan Thacker-Smith, Shopify

In this talk, we'll explore how Shopify designed and built its GraphQL API to make it easy for any team to extend and use our GraphQL schema.
 
This includes how we built our own schema definition layer on top of the GraphQL Ruby gem, how we seamlessly included batching and caching in our field definitions, how we approached authorization and authentication as well as how we use the API from mobile clients written in java and swift.
