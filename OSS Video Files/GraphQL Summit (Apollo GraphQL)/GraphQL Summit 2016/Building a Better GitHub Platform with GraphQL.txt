Title: Building a Better GitHub Platform with GraphQL
Publication date: 2016-11-02
Playlist: GraphQL Summit 2016
Description: 
	Brandon Black, GitHub

At GitHub we build products and tools to help empower developers and enable them to collaboratively build software with millions of other developers from all around the world. Internally, we use those same tools to build GitHub itself, and externally we support a broad eco-system of innovative products and services that work to further extend that vision. GraphQL is now a part of making all of this possible and represents a promising path forward for building a better platform both internally and externally. In this talk, we'll share some of the motivations and driving factors behind the decision to invest in GraphQL at GitHub, why we chose to expose our GraphQL interface externally to developers and some of the challenges and learnings we've encountered along the way.
