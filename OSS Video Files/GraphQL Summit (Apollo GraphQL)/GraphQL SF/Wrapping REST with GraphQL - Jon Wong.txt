ðŸ‘‰Full Description

In this day and age, dealing with REST endpoints is a requirement â€” but don't let that stop you from using GraphQL!

Learn how the Coursera engineering team took advantage of REST to build out their GraphQL servers, some of the strategies we learned along the way, and hear about some of the tools, libraries, and workflows that make layering GraphQL on top of your REST APIs a breeze.
