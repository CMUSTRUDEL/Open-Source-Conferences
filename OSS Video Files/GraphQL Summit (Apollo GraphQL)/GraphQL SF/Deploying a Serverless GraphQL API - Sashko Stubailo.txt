ðŸ‘‰Full Description

More and more, we find that GraphQL APIs are being developed by product developers that don't want to worry about operating backend services. The serverless function model of deployment has a lot of benefits for APIs, but isn't as well suited when you need some stateful features such as caching or performance metrics aggregation. In this talk, Sashko presents a solution that combines the best of both worlds: A stateless GraphQL API running in AWS Lambda for ease of deployment with Apollo Engine in front to handle stateful concerns.
