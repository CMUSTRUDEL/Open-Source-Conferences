ðŸ‘‰Full Description

At Samsara, we use GraphQL to rapidly build new features. Samsara's platform has many moving pieces: gateways and sensors in the field, data processing backends, and our web and mobile applications. To keep things sane, we use static typing everywhere: Protobufs, Go, GraphQL, and TypeScript. In this talk we'll discuss how we use Thunder, our Go GraphQL server, apollo-codegen, and other tools to automatically glue these pieces together and make development easier with close to zero developer effort.
