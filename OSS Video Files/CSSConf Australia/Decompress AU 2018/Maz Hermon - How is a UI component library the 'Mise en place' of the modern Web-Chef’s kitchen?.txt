Title: Maz Hermon - How is a UI component library the 'Mise en place' of the modern Web-Chef’s kitchen?
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: Decompress AU 2018
Description: 
	Do you need help convincing your team or wider company they’d benefit from creating a living style guide and UI component library? Or getting buy in on why the one you’ve started is a good idea? Let’s run through a fun analogy comparing how having a design system and building a front-end component library is like the essential afternoon preparation session in a high performing kitchen known as ‘Mise en place’. You’ll learn how to explain how having this in place seperates the amatures from the professionals in kitchens around the world, and will ensure that by the time users walk in the virtual door, the dev kitchen is operating at high speed with grace, and no one’s left waiting, grumpily staring down the wait-staff with their best evil-eyes. 

This talk will benefit you regardless of what level you're at. You’ll come away with a new way to explain to your technical and non-technical stakeholders why you and your team should be given the go ahead to support the successful fast paced delivery of features and products for your users. Don’t sit back and say ‘I told you so’ when things slow to crawl and you're all tangled in legacy code and specifity wars with your heavy CSS. Instead, come and learn a new way to frame the argument to ensure you’ve given everyone the best chance to realise what you already know to be true, before it’s too late.

thanks a lot thank you thanks good luck

00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,400
hi everyone it's really great to be I've

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,750
had a really a really great week and I

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,369
really appreciate all the effort that's

00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,230
gone into it so so thanks a lot for

00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:26,570
there you know I hope that you will all

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,770
we had a great time too and just before

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,910
we get started I'm still working on my

00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,169
inclusive language because I know how

00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,509
important it is so I thought it might be

00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:33,140
fun if I do say anything that's ablest

00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,780
or anything like that

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,760
and you can say well good or something

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,500
like that and if I hear it I know that I

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,390
just did that in there I can apologize

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,500
again but um but it is something I'm

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,600
working on I've also been really working

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,890
on accessibility with the web and so

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,600
when I put these slides together I did

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,560
try to make sure everything's readable

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,020
and things like that so if there's any

00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,380
trouble reading things I'd like to hear

00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,910
about it after as well so so yeah I'm

00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,290
I'm here today to talk to you about to

00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,640
give you a new way to communicate the

00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,870
benefits of style guide driven

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,200
development to your company and your

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,729
clients and I'm and yes the question is

00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,650
how is working with the UI component

00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,330
library the me some class of the modern

00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,150
web chef's kitchen so kind of put this

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,439
together to be a quite enjoyable by

00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,170
everyone since there's no technical

00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,210
barrier to any of this if you haven't

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,920
thought about working with padding

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,210
libraries and design systems before you

00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,590
can just think directly about the food

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,460
and then and then just sort of make the

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,960
bridge the gaps as we go so yeah and

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,840
another title for this could be all good

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,069
web shifts to me some plus and for now

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,319
all you need to know that me some pluses

00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:35,689
that is just kitchen preparation so it's

00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:38,450
it's chopping onions it's preparing

00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,009
sources it's doing things that you can

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,259
do ahead of time you might be filling a

00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:43,789
fish so if you've ever seen a ship's

00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:46,310
table or a master chef you might already

00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:48,049
be a little bit familiar that's quite

00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,399
popular in New Zealand we actually

00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,530
really like the Australian master chef

00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,969
of if you're gonna do any of them but so

00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,380
am yeah I invite you to put your doubts

00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:56,179
aside just for a little bit and just to

00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,030
go with me here come on a little journey

00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:00,619
into the we've just kitchen you know so

00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,389
imagine that your company is a top web

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:06,049
restaurant and we're all in the kitchen

00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:08,090
together okay so I promise not to

00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,369
mention anything about food that I'm not

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,200
using as a direct reference to working

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,610
with the web so keep that in mind and if

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,770
I have I push the boat out too far for

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,990
you let's just remember that if that's

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,790
the case that's the first thing we need

00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,909
to do is pick a team and a way of

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,110
working more importantly and see here's

00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,190
two teams we could pick with

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,190
just out with and we might reference

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,140
these as we go so yeah the first team

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,150
the team on the lift they'd like to turn

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,920
up it at five o'clock just before

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,800
dinnertime and get started cooking and

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,840
when the orders come in so they say that

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,490
they're more flexible this way and they

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,600
give the argument there we'll wait to

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,860
see what's ordered before we start

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,040
preparing anything and then we know

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,990
we're using our time most most wisely

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,540
but from my experience that's quite a

00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,650
stressful way to work and it doesn't

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,140
always lead to the best results for

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,870
users so for the risks they took we're

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,700
gonna go with the team on the right so

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,260
the team on the right likes to arrive in

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,320
the morning even though dinners not

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,320
served until 6 p.m. they spend the day

00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:09,050
testing ideas preparing ingredients and

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,340
sources that are likely to need and are

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,220
doing things that they just won't have

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,720
time for later on so you can probably

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,790
see where I'm going with this you know

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,550
this is the nature of the ideas I have

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,260
to share with you today so we're going

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,900
with the team on the right and that's

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,489
the team that does me some plus so if

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,640
you take a take one thing away from

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:31,400
today I'd like it to be that just being

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,380
prepared makes high pressure work more

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,160
fun and we give better results to our

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,049
users and that this analogy between food

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,209
prep and working with component

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:42,320
libraries and libraries is something

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:43,640
that you can use to take back to your

00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,470
companies if you're not already working

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,330
this way and use it as a way to explain

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,580
to potentially non-technical or

00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,970
technical stakeholders about about the

00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,470
benefits of working this way see there's

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,180
no way that you can consistently put up

00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,190
experiences like this for diners in

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,010
critics alike without a lot of

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,989
preparation testing iteration you need

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,519
to be able to put up ten of these at

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,769
once and know that they're going to be

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,600
consistently to this level yeah you need

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,739
to do a lot of work in advance so what

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,000
we'll cover will just quickly define

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,120
some terms so we're all on the same page

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,530
and unpack what is me some place more

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,850
directly and how it relates to the web

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,160
and if we've got time we'll do this

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,290
quicker journey from pantry to plate

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,140
just to talk about efficiency really an

00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,669
innovation C will loosely defined design

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,580
system pet and library and style guide

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,540
and M yep you might define these

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,220
differently for me and it's that's

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,270
totally fine so design system for today

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,830
I'd like us to think of this as the

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,120
cuisine okay

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,650
are we gonna cook more

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,560
Italian and we're doing Japanese that

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,210
we're doing classic French so you can

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,500
see that the decision that we make on

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,110
this is going to affect all other

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,930
decisions from here right and so it's

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,699
really important to know that up front

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,040
what's your cuisine now patent library's

00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:57,040
component libraries UI component

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,000
libraries we could think of these as

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,550
ingredients and tips on those

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,690
ingredients ingredients and recipes so

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,940
you might have a page all about red

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,740
cabbage what's it what's it good to peel

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,770
is what is different ways that you could

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,010
prepare it so in a component library

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,630
that might be a button or some tabs and

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,910
a style guide so I'm thinking of this

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,850
today's cookbook so the place where

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,440
these things live and it might be

00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,539
documentation on your patterns and brand

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,889
s it's a few different things so that

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,820
web component library might be part of

00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,740
that and there might be other things

00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,010
there too so this could be a well well

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,710
wouldn't cookbook so what is me some

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:37,639
plus literally it means to sit in place

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,110
and it's an yeah it means that you're

00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,180
getting things ready you've got all your

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,770
bowls laid out you've measured precisely

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,320
some ingredients you're about to use

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,910
just like on the cooking shows and not

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,289
quite to the turkey chop pie but things

00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,180
that would make the turkey pie you'd be

00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:52,669
getting really here if you hear how much

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,229
see earlier and see you're just going on

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,849
a little journey again into the kitchen

00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,940
and just really understand what meat

00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:01,820
some pluses so okay we're in the kitchen

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:04,580
this morning the doors are all closed

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,130
there's no customers here but the

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,690
kitchens still very busy and we've got

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,060
Ravi in the back he might be finally

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,710
cutting onions and carrots in a way that

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,560
can be used in a variety of dishes later

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,789
and we've got octo making sure all the

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,650
things are laid out on the bench and

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,120
ready for us we've got all the bowls we

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,970
need all the different size wooden

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,060
spoons mixers anything like that and

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,560
then steli she's reducing a stock and

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,419
making a tomato sauce at the same time

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,490
so these are things that actually do

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,630
take a bit of time and you don't want to

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,849
be doing that when someone's waiting at

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,310
the table right that's when the

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:38,479
pressures really on you know while we're

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,250
doing this

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,630
Jack realizes they were actually out of

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,820
anchovies for one of our sources and

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,620
he's run back to the store so we're

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,270
recognizing things that are that have

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,130
come up things have come up and we've

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,110
got the time to deal with it right so

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,340
because we're working in this way so we

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,220
have that option later tonight when the

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,780
gifts are all at the table and all this

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,940
time the team are tasting and refining

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,410
what they're doing they're getting

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,630
feedback from each other and their taste

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,830
buds and from that feedback they're able

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,620
to iterate on what they're doing right

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:09,730
so you're cutting things in a certain

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,470
way getting everything really just right

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,840
so there's no final dish in sight in any

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,690
of these shots but the common elements

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,950
are really coming together so we're

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,710
feeling pretty good about how tonight's

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,750
cook is gonna go and this is me some

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,890
plus an action and this is how I'm

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,070
recommending we should be working with

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,730
the whip and yes it's not a it's not a

00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,460
new idea

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,810
and will I'm packing a bit too so you're

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,970
what at what are the benefits if we work

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,080
in this way what do we give so one of

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,480
the big things and this is this is

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,220
literally from the cooking world it

00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,530
helps to ensure quality and consistency

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,680
in our cooking so that there's a direct

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:47,780
relationship there our measurements are

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,880
precise now we've worked in a way where

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,900
we can easily replicate our processes to

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,450
receipt achieve and consistent results

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,230
so there's quite a quite a strong

00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,810
relationship between the food and the

00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,880
web were there but the big thing is that

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,580
on our lives are just more enjoyable

00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,070
right and the customer gets a better

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,480
experience so it's very unlikely that a

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,010
chef will have a breakdown tonight

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,390
while they're trying to struggle to fill

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,790
impossible orders to a really limited

00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,590
time line you know one works in big on

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,440
big products and big companies that can

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,390
be can be a real thing like managing our

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,980
enjoyment at work just by being more

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,980
organized and if some big wins

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,370
yeah there's much lower risk also of any

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,510
customers waiting too long in the dining

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:34,160
room so timing can be everything with a

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,660
good eating experience and we're really

00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,550
working hard to gain control of their

00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,190
timing and we know what to expect

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,650
we've planned accordingly by identifying

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,120
things that can be done in advance and

00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,620
making sure that we have they're done by

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,190
the time we're trying to do entire meals

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:52,190
or entire flows or experiences so how

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,930
does this all relate to the web I've

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,040
been hinting at things as we've gone but

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,380
let's just be more direct for a while

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,460
just in case it's not not super clear so

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,800
what we're really talking about is

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,900
lovingly creating a set of reusable web

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,560
components that are shared within a

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,170
company

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,699
and can be refined over time by anyone

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,009
working there so anyone can feed back

00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:11,600
into the system and what we end up with

00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:14,779
is a petting library and a style guide

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,660
that's born from the design system so if

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:18,920
we go back to our Jamie shot sneaking

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,379
down in the bottom here we've got you

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,879
know alongside his and his beans we've

00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:25,430
got our little buttons and our tabs so

00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,379
and you're we're saying that just as you

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,209
prepare your vegetables just as you

00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:30,860
prepare some of these things now we can

00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:35,360
be preparing our media objects our

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:37,100
carousels buttons and puts many reusable

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,100
UI elements before we get around to

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,420
making these entire pages flows and this

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,399
means when you are doing Network you're

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,809
really focusing on you eggs and not

00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,040
thinking about their hover States on a

00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:50,029
button or something which at that point

00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,529
would just be a distraction right so

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,999
this is not new this way of working is

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,199
really well-established already let's

00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:57,350
just spend a bit of time validating that

00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:59,329
for everyone before we jump back in so

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,800
here's a bunch of screenshots of pattern

00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:02,689
libraries style guides from well-known

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,220
companies some of these might be really

00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:05,899
familiar

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,930
here's a quick slide just comparing top

00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,309
tech companies that work in some kind of

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,709
style age of and development kind of way

00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:14,769
and comparing that with top restaurants

00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,300
of the world is so much my ship's table

00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:19,939
favorites and these top restaurants are

00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,199
all doing me some plus so if we think

00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:24,050
about this what we're really seeing is

00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:25,220
that the yeah the quality of the code

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,750
and the pattern library and the quality

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,670
of the meson Plus that happens in the

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,680
kitchen during the afternoon flows right

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,089
through to the final products right so

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,470
it's not just that our do this get

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,790
anyone to do the simple stuff in the day

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,319
and that real ships are coming at night

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,910
you really need to be focusing on

00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:39,199
quality all the way through and a bidder

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,759
you can do your me some plus in the

00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:45,079
afternoon the bidder your final results

00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:47,149
are yeah more industry proof this time

00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,889
from Airbnb it's talking about how a

00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:52,129
unified design system is essential to

00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:54,019
building better and faster so the big

00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:55,220
question is what assumptions are safe to

00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,509
make like if we think back to that team

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,829
on the left that we decided not to go

00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:59,329
with they didn't want to make any

00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:01,610
assumptions because they felt like it

00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:03,110
was too dangerous but some assumptions

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,449
are okay to make right now what can we

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,399
get done ahead of time we're pretty sure

00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:08,300
with it we'll need onions

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,819
wouldn't and this is a particular type

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,959
of cuisine that doesn't include them

00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:13,550
that's a pretty safe assumption to make

00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,379
so just because we've cut onions and

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,560
have them ready now that doesn't mean we

00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:20,190
need to use them in all

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,800
our dishes right but then when we do

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,029
need them they're ready to go we know

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,100
they've been catch us how we want them

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:27,900
which in our case might mean that our

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,310
tabs have an accessibility pattern this

00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,660
we can share with the wrister company

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,820
without them having to do the research

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,279
on that and we'll use the testing

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,900
potentially and yeah that stuff can be

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,620
baked in so we're doing things in

00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,760
advance here is a quick slide just

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,810
talking about snowflakes

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,430
so snowflake might be something

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,410
beautiful and unique it doesn't quite

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,760
fit with the system but that's still

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,900
valid and we're not it's not stopping

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,000
anyone from doing that by working in

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,230
this way just means that that's just an

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,210
extra step that doesn't come from the

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:58,230
shared it's shared library but it's

00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:59,400
still valid if you can justify it and so

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,960
it's not restrictive as the important

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,779
thing to understand it's like enabling

00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,400
without being restrictive so here's just

00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,070
a direct comparison so let's say our

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,500
onions are the buttons checkboxes are

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:13,170
the carrots and the mushrooms can be the

00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,360
tabs yeah so here's a random collection

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,040
of things on both sides that can be

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,670
combined into a variety of different

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,560
dishes yet provided that the next stages

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:26,339
are done with the same care and

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,170
attention so again we're just looking at

00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,760
the relationship between the individual

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,430
parts and the finished deliverable

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,830
feature or a dish and if we can identify

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,060
an issue with one of these ingredients

00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,260
we can just fix it in that one place if

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,240
we go to our bowl of chopped onions

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,860
before the next for the next cook we can

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,910
just fix how those onions are chopped we

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,870
don't need to change the entire risk

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:48,060
feel and yeah which which is really

00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,560
powerful for your efficiency so the way

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,210
in which we combine these things to take

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,370
out our random ingredients and combine

00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,270
them into a beautiful dish could just be

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,800
a light start I could be something

00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:00,330
minimal it could be more fully featured

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,310
but the key thing to think about is that

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,110
we are splitting the work into two major

00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,730
just think of phases right we're doing

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,730
the preparation and the service so there

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,930
may some place and the service and me

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,880
some parts we've talked about a lot the

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,430
kitchen prep service time is when we

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,930
have real users waiting at the table for

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,190
us to deliver those experiences to them

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,580
and they don't want to wait longer than

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,260
expected so that brings me to just a

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,020
quick talk about efficiency so this is a

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,280
bit more visual just talking about how

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,110
being more efficient and design and

00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,240
development can save you some time you

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,990
can use that time to iterate the more

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,850
you iterate

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,010
more likely you are to innovate soon

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,990
this is a journey from pantry to plate

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,990
so we just think that the bubbling pot

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,330
on the lift is the start of the Sprint

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,890
the start of the cook and the plate with

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,220
the cutlery is food on the table

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,540
experiences delivered to users right so

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,980
if you know if you're not doing miss on

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,370
plus you might start cutting your onions

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,690
at that

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,260
at that point and there's the length of

00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:57,690
the line as time so let's say one sprint

00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,240
you get you get a dish to the table or

00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,520
you get some feature out to users it's

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,470
just of any length of time you can think

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,600
but in the next next sprint next dish

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,550
that comes out is a similar maybe a

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,680
little bit longer some similar length of

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,970
length of work and each time you may

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,830
have started cutting your onions or

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,520
doing some preparation for that one dish

00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:19,440
at the start of that line so everything

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,529
that we've said so far we're really

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,790
suggesting that if we can identify the

00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,529
things that are the same in these two

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,450
dishes they both have onions and carrots

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:29,430
they're both over this particular source

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,750
and their wrist is different right so

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:34,290
the stuff on the Left might be the stuff

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,459
that this year then there's no reason

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,680
why we can't do that work ahead of time

00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:40,020
or if we've done it in that first dish

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,600
we've already got it move that into the

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,760
Nissan Plus into the shared code to the

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,839
pattern library and we've effectively

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,310
moved that ship date back so there's now

00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,770
a Delta between that previous delivery

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,760
time and the shipped features and that's

00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,959
what we're looking at with this dotted

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,420
line so that's time that you've saved

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,120
and what does that mean it's like cool

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,170
we save some time so what but what

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,589
they're really is it's quite a big

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,300
opportunity especially once it scales up

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:07,980
so what could you do you could be bitter

00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,560
and faster if you go back to that man

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,270
Airbnb quote so how does this relate to

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,670
that so you could be faster good ship

00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,410
early and move on you ship two weeks

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,990
ahead of schedule maybe and you just

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,160
move on so and that can be good if

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,870
you're trying to beat competitors to

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,399
market on something you need it you need

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,220
to put some three features out that all

00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,899
sort of work towards one goal there

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,579
could be a valid strategy so you might

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,839
end up with your three-course meal and

00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:34,050
quite a short amount of time which

00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,370
wouldn't always be a good thing but but

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,810
the big opportunity really is is

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:41,010
innovation right and we only get there

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:44,110
through feedback in iteration so if this

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,420
dotted line as time you've said then

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,550
deliver a better experience to users in

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,959
that same time because you shipped

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,180
earlier we've already established that

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,709
if you could move on but instead you

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,110
could just take the plate to the table

00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:58,079
ask the user how it was get some

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,600
feedback take that back to the kitchen

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,290
iterate right and then while you do that

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,990
you're just getting better and better

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,450
with your dish so if we think about the

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,040
benefits of an of that for a single

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,540
product let's say you've got this this

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,220
may some plasters pet and library in the

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,640
middle there and you're supporting a

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:19,329
product so you've got shared code going

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,160
into the product iterate but she your

00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:22,360
new learnings back and next time you

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,690
take it out it's dat much better right

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,160
so that's that's a great way to work and

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,690
then this could be multiple teams and

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,839
they're one product or if you think

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,579
about it as multiple products now you've

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,899
really opened up quite a lot of a lot of

00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:36,700
power there because you've all fitting

00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:38,260
back into the centralized code of things

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,279
that are you know they won't have your

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,140
business logic in there though but

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,000
there'll be like reusable UI components

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,550
that are just needed and all three of

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,680
these products can be tricky to find the

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,560
line there sometimes but if you can do

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,000
this all of a sudden you're working more

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,050
collaboratively right you're already

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,279
doing that for your single product

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,170
you've opened up a lot of collaboration

00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,519
for your teams but now if you've got a

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,100
whole portfolio of different products

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,240
you're all working together now so you

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,890
might have you might have one major

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,870
product and a really minor niche thing

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,549
on the side now you're getting you're

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,559
leveraging all your devs and design and

00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:10,470
everyone from your major product and

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,309
feeding that power into your minor and

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,929
that's that's that's really powerful

00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,459
because no one set to switch teams

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:16,900
you haven't had to restructure or

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,010
anything like that but just because

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,559
you're working in a more collaborative

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,500
way and I'm really focusing on quality

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,669
on the sharable stuff yeah I'm sure you

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,880
can see that there's a lot of power

00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:29,650
there so yeah that's basically it in

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,090
summary all this is really just about

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,750
ensuring that we're using our time

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,860
wisely for the customers sake and that's

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,450
in the best interest of all your

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,410
stakeholders right so if we can just be

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,890
better for our users

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:44,760
that's just best for everyone so do what

00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:48,100
you can in advance constantly iterate

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,200
improve on your parents shear the work

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,640
and max the company of the teams that

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,559
you work with that's a really big part

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,900
of it being able to shear standing on

00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,460
each other's shoulders are not just

00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,180
reinventing the wheel in there you don't

00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,710
have to people

00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,230
different parts of the building working

00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,500
through the same difficult problem yeah

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,490
and they're not not knowing about it and

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,070
so yeah if you do all these things what

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,020
you end up with is a petting library and

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,910
that's how you are component library is

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,560
the most on plus of the web ship's

00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,450
kitchen hopefully I've convinced you up

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,470
there so thank you very much thanks for

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,470
having me appreciate it
