Title: Juliet Brown - Intersection between art and technology
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: Decompress AU 2018
Description: 
	Programmers are artists. I am a web animator, developer, and artist. I come from A Fine Arts background, and a question I often get asked is how and why did you become a developer if you come from an arts background? For me, programming is creative, and I would like to share my journey with you. How I brought my diverse background to the developer community and what I am doing with that now. How I relate to technology with its subject matter, medium, and process. Using coding as an artistic medium references and also pushes the boundaries of what art is and can do. Painting and drawing come with such a historical background. 

By bringing the old medium into technology - a new medium, a tool that we as people are involved with day to day excites me, it brings new possibilities for css and javascript and the technology space. 

Common themes I explore in my art practice is popular culture, and the real and the imaginary. Recently, I have been working at converting my practice (painting, drawings) into a large human sized 3D animation world. 

By combing Art and technology together, challenges the notions of the digital world and also how we perceive art and the 'artist'

hello I'm Juliet thanks for having me at

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,699
decompress

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,849
so I'm from New Zealand I love in the

00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:23,140
capital known as Wellington and so I

00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:28,929
work for a web development company

00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:32,920
called SilverStripe so I'm an artist I

00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:36,839
studied Fine Arts in Auckland I finished

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,820
that in 2014 and my art practice

00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:42,699
explores the intersections between

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,180
history culture and technology so I

00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:48,640
often like to create kind of like

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,280
strange unique moments for people and

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,510
often finding the Internet as a starting

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,420
place

00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,570
so I investigate things such as their

00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:04,300
collective unconscious popular culture

00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:06,399
and the real and the imaginary so I'm

00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,710
drawn to and conventional and

00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:12,090
conventional air mythologies such as

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:15,670
painting drawing and collage and

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:19,300
animation encoding so when I make a work

00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:21,700
I purposely make it ambiguous I think of

00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,130
it as creating my own new type of

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,759
culture and society of people in a

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:31,300
particular time so I'm also a web

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,130
developer at SilverStripe where I've

00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,550
been working for about two and a half

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:39,099
years and particularly passionate about

00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:42,789
JavaScript and front-end so when I

00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:45,550
finished my fine arts degree I went on

00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:49,479
to a boot camp style of coding called

00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:52,840
dev Academy in Wellington so a question

00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:56,099
I often get asked is how did I become a

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,110
web developer when I studied Fine Arts

00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:02,670
so there's a lot of parallels for me but

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:06,190
one of important thing is bringing in

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,619
animation and bringing it to life and I

00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,370
really enjoy coding and bring life into

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:16,000
things and bring them alive people often

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:19,329
think programming isn't intuitive but in

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,020
autism Frank took expression of some

00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:27,950
primal urge but to me these aren't both

00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:30,830
the video is not going as a frantic

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:35,650
expression of some primal urge but these

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:43,670
aren't true I these are just stereotypes

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:46,070
hopefully my animation plays so I wanted

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,430
to talk about art and programming and

00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:51,950
how it is creative first of all so it's

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,580
a quite a big topic to talk in 15

00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,350
minutes

00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,720
so I'm just going to give you a few of

00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,930
my perceptions of observations and the

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,690
workplace and my personal experience

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:08,630
experience so one thing is that we're

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:11,240
all makers in doers and so so a question

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,690
I want to ask is what does it mean to be

00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,650
creative I think creativity is often

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,420
pushed to the side and seen secondary

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,890
but it's a fundamental part of society

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,580
and technology is a very fundamental

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,940
part of that so it's solving problems in

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:34,370
a new way and just challenging

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:36,260
perspectives it means facing fears and

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,870
breaking routines of doing something

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,390
different it means looking at a problem

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,590
and more than one way there's a thousand

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,280
different ropes to get to there in

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,280
solution

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,700
it means searching for inspiration

00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:58,880
inspiration in the even most mundane

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:02,030
places it means being curious and asking

00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:05,210
those questions so programming is

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,790
creative here's three examples of the

00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:13,280
iterators we've got the four the four of

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:17,500
and the for each so it's they all get

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,820
the in the same solution but there's

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,600
different ways you can get to there in

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:26,420
so I believe that's creative programming

00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,700
so creativity is used and I believe if

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:34,400
you're doing that you're making a piece

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:37,639
of artwork in itself and we're all

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:43,490
having fun right as I studied

00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:46,729
creatively as intelligence having fun so

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:49,939
I wanted to talk about the whys first of

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:52,639
all second of all so there are also

00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:55,939
quite a few of these so I wanted to

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,879
speak about the most important to me so

00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:00,620
the first one is creative flow and the

00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,069
second one is using your brain and

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:08,090
different ways strengthens it so

00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:09,830
creative flow it means you're making

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,770
meaningful work and you're fully present

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,509
in the moment it means you're losing

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,449
track of time and you're fully engaged

00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:21,560
in the activity and neural chemicals

00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:23,000
augment the creative process and to take

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,539
then you can take in more information

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,310
and amplifies learning and this is

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:30,620
actually one of the most addictive kind

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,529
of states of being and which creates

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,229
purpose and happiness it's known as HC

00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:39,129
type of state and happiness is

00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:44,539
contagious we all want to be around

00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:48,409
happy so the second one using your brain

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:51,589
in different ways as strengthens it so

00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:53,839
your brain is a pattern organizing

00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:56,689
machine and the stronger brain is

00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,870
creative and cognitively flexible and

00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:02,120
able to reason efficiently so learning

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:05,330
new skills breaks pattern routine and

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,580
adds the brain's abilities which forces

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,589
the brain to continually restructure

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,009
restructure its filing system and

00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:16,990
prevents earth thought rights so this

00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:20,689
can also fight burnout and reduce stress

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,389
so Leonardo da Vinci we're probably all

00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:27,460
familiar with him and he was a painter

00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:31,120
sculpture sculptor an engineer architect

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:34,219
mathematician and inventor he uses

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,710
well-balanced logic and imagination and

00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:40,089
so he was using his brain obviously in

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:43,879
different ways so in my experience

00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:46,490
creative people such as artists are very

00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:49,389
logical thinkers and the illogic is just

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,819
not based on the status quo

00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:54,430
there's devilishly illogic that makes

00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:59,110
sense to them the thinker as a thinker

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:04,000
and the audience so it's about pushing

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:07,060
yourself a little each so pushing

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,030
yourself a little each time so it's

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,330
having challenge and school and so that

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,280
as that type of creative flow so this

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,009
was like the first JavaScript animation

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,289
I taught myself and I thought of it been

00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,990
quite daunting and tricky when I first

00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:24,759
seen all the animations on the Internet

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,129
but after doing some digging it was more

00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,629
simple than I realized

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,690
so it's about taking a step forward but

00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:34,210
taking one there isn't too big and

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,280
having a goal that is reachable so now I

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,530
can take those learnings and apply them

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,529
further to make other animations that I

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:47,009
do now so it's just having a goal that

00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:49,240
is reachable so I spoken about the Y's

00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,289
couple Y's and now I just wanted to

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,090
speak about the how

00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:57,940
so how can we apply these things so for

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,879
me it's questioning the base premises so

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:04,900
you're repurposing combining and always

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,870
trying to improve what you're making you

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,909
may have heard of the quote good artists

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:14,289
copy and great artists steal from

00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:16,150
Picasso so for example for a painter a

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:19,180
museum as a reference library of

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:22,029
techniques and a developer Google as a

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,949
reference library for techniques so you

00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:26,199
may not be the first to try something

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:28,870
that you did it so well everyone thinks

00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,819
of you when they see that style so it's

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,860
really reusing what's out there and

00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:37,959
making it into your own thing for me

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,140
that's being inspired and influenced and

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:44,050
then creating something new so you can

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,890
see I do that as an arts in programmer

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:52,949
I'm influenced by Hieronymus Bosch who

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:55,480
was around in the 1400 to the 1500s and

00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:58,660
his focus on the left hand mines on the

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,540
right so I you can see I've repurposed

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,920
some elements and combined things but

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,910
it's come out as my owner

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,850
you know at work so everything feeds

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:13,180
into each other I start from writing

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,220
doodles and scratch just getting things

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,279
out of my head and then searching the

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,920
internet I've just combined it combined

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:23,860
two images there and then pushed it

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,399
further into drawing and then pushed it

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,620
further into digital and SVG

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:33,190
illustration and then have pushed it

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,529
further and then made my own little

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,630
hunter factory because of these people

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,910
who make creatures they make they're

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,600
called little hunters this is kind of

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:46,300
like a interesting angle on it so I'm

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,430
combining my imagination and my logic

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,800
and just chat starting to challenge

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,959
so certainly challenge myself over time

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,709
so I've booked this language up over

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,779
time so for me being creative there's

00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:01,899
gonna be probably no ever satisfaction

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:03,370
or no into exploring new ideas so I'm

00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:11,709
always searching for something new

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:15,810
enter lone thanks so I've got this

00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:15,810
simple click event

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:29,370
just a simple nerve a toggle so I wanted

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,520
to set speak about how I've applied the

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:35,190
same type of thinking repurposing and

00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:39,089
improving it as I would with imagery but

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:42,870
just with code so I'm using a simpler

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:44,220
simple JavaScript concept and I'm just

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,250
always trying to find a new way to

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:50,520
improve it so here's one example and

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,649
then I've also tried to write it and as

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:59,670
a class constructor more object-oriented

00:10:52,649 --> 00:11:01,890
way and then also in view and react and

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,110
so these will do the same things but

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,510
I've always just been trying to ask the

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,399
whys and the how's and how that would

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:12,930
apply to what I'm trying to get on the

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:17,190
front end so also I wanted to speak

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:20,339
about the process so another part that

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:23,279
there's quite a few bits to this but one

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:27,600
that I find quite important is starting

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,089
with a blank canvas so to construct a

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,829
good program you want to be added tool

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,529
you want to be able to see the

00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:37,410
consequences in your head not just do it

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:40,290
line by line of the code you have to

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,180
have to able to totally visualize it so

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,279
it's having that abstract thinking and

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,529
be able to translate those abstract

00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,860
design patterns and visualizing and

00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:53,070
seeing the whole picture so you can see

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:58,410
I do that with painting and a canvas and

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:59,940
also my sublime mate editor so whether

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,730
it's actually just having a blank piece

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,230
of paper canvas or your editor you're

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,230
building something up from nothing

00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,000
don't

00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:22,329
so it's about learning by doing and that

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,510
gradual refinement so artists enjoy

00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,889
asking the why and the how of the world

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,649
artists can learn as I am to ask the

00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:32,230
computer the same types of questions so

00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:36,220
great great pieces of art can take weeks

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:38,620
months years to make in such so can

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,360
developing software is like words so

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:47,860
it's not being afraid to fail and having

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:52,180
that persistence so also many artists

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:56,040
are developers so you may have heard of

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:58,269
Sara Dresner who is big on SVG animation

00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,480
she originally came from an art

00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:03,779
background she was doing illustration

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,730
and drawing she wrote the book about SVG

00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:11,130
animations and if you haven't heard of

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,130
her I highly recommend her to look up

00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:17,350
Anzac LIBOR Minh he comes from a fine

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:19,329
arts background also in he was really

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:29,910
into drawing and it's fine arts degree

00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:29,910
and now he does drawing with software so

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:37,899
for me also going forward I am just been

00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:39,639
really looking more into SVG animation

00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,529
lately the green sock

00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,100
library and if you haven't heard of it

00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:46,839
recommend to look it up so I'm always

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:55,449
going to be transferring my drawing into

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:56,769
the digital and this video please so

00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:58,300
that's just something as a work in

00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,639
progress so I'm just playing around at

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,000
the moment but also I was inspired that

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,190
by this studio smack Plus this 3d world

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,440
so now I'm looking at three jeaious and

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:11,529
a frame and there's so many creative

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,569
libraries out there and frameworks just

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,480
to play around with and be influenced in

00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:18,160
great documentation so for me I want to

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,540
create my world

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,019
during stuff that I was showing you

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:31,600
earlier and be inspired by this because

00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:33,699
I find it quite this arising so I just

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,220
want to say thank you for having me here

00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:38,350
and so I believe combining art and

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,240
technology to give that challenges the

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:43,899
digital world and also how we perceive

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,189
that art art and the artist which I find

00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,740
it's really important to break down

00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:49,899
those barriers and stereotypes we define

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,829
art as an expression of application of

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:55,870
human creative skill and imagination

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:58,149
then to me that means every meaningful

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:01,360
piece of software is an expression of

00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:03,970
somebody's idea or angle or at solving

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,250
the problem so I believe artists

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:09,990
programmers can be artists or are

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:12,449
artists and artists can be programmers

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:16,209
if you're interested further in my work

00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:19,760
you can follow me on Twitter air or look

00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:24,070
me up or ebooks or Instagram thank you

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,070
[Applause]
