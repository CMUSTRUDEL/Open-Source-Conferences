Title: Kylie Long - Practical tools for happier, more seamless collaboration
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: Decompress AU 2018
Description: 
	So much is expected of our designers and developers. They need to know myriad programming languages and other technical competencies, they must keep abreast of emerging trends and; contribute to the broader community through meetups and online peer learning platforms. 

Often, our designers and developers also work in non-hierarchical organisations, multidisciplinary teams or as freelancers. With organisations like Spotify, Valve & Culture Amp we’re feeling inspired to organise differently, to 'swarm' as fit for purpose teams; to collaborate and lead from anywhere despite role or rank. 

But this scenario is not without its challenges. A couple of years ago, the Inspire9 team started to hear some grumbling from the community. Things like "My colleague won’t listen to me. I have this great idea and we’re supposed to collaborate, but he just does whatever he wants" and "I don’t know what to do when there is conflict, I just freeze". 

They noticed that while their community was technically brilliant, they were struggling with some of the 'human dynamics' of their work. They decided to do something about it and invited me in to run a leadership program "Leading in Networks" with the community which I'll share about in my presentation. 

A very practical talk, full of the tools and tricks I shared with the I9 community. Hear about the insights we gained through our leadership journey, and what changed for participants as they attained deeper insights into their approach and practice as collaborators in multidisciplinary team environments. Hear about the tools and tricks they found most useful and take away your own insights to grow your collaborative practice.

hi everyone

00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:21,520
okay that's us we're on um welcome

00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,039
thanks for showing up today to hear my

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,470
presentation on gaining practical skills

00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:34,390
and tools for happier more seamless

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:36,699
collaboration in 2016 inspire 9 approach

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,360
to our startup peer Academy with a

00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:42,610
partnership opportunity pure academy had

00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,320
recently finished angel cube accelerator

00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,680
program some of you who may have heard

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,920
of that and we were working at a inspire

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,739
9 at the time we were furthering the

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,570
development of our SAS product and

00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:57,400
internal skill sharing marketplaces

00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:03,790
which were still working on to this day

00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:06,070
I 9 continues to be a leader in the

00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,950
future of work narrative there's just a

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:12,460
couple of images here from our time at I

00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:17,110
9 we've moved on now but the image below

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:20,800
is of a dog Ponyo who was a known mascot

00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:23,440
for a time um at the time when I nine

00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,690
approached us they noticed that for many

00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,670
in their community while there was a lot

00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,310
of technical brilliance as developers

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,409
and the like they were nevertheless

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,310
experiencing challenges by this paradigm

00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:37,210
of what we might call collaboration

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,960
collaboration and collaborative

00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:43,240
practices they really do feature

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,729
strongly in the narratives of the future

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,640
of work and certainly in the context of

00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:50,650
automation and globalization and we

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,740
really are required to have competencies

00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,150
in seamless collaboration across

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,030
multidisciplinary teams platforms and

00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:00,010
countries and we really are just going

00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:04,330
to see an increase of this need in the

00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:08,580
years to come in fact when we were at

00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:11,080
inspire 9 we used to take teams through

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,989
the multiple floors of the building to

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,060
show them what the future of work that's

00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,340
already happening actually looks like by

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,049
demonstrating the ways that startups

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,650
were working together to develop their

00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:26,650
products at the time and yet when

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,510
inspire 9 approached us clearly they

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,019
were recognizing

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,810
need for collaboration capabilities

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,489
beyond stand-ups platforms meetups and

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,730
other sort of collaborative tools and

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,760
platforms that existed at the time and

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,760
so we sort of had a theory on what it is

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,409
that they were recognizing that people

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,349
in the community were needing and had a

00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:51,239
bit of a hypothesis about this which

00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,280
shaped a learning journey that we took

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,890
with a group of people that inspire nine

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,019
chord leading in networks I mean through

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,859
this journey we really wanted to prove

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:04,650
or falsify the hypothesis that we were

00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:10,230
forming around collaboration which I'll

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:13,950
share a little bit of in a moment but

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:17,099
first I'm going to share a story many

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,530
years ago I was a strategic planner in a

00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,659
local government I worked on very

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,180
complex projects with hundreds of

00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,849
stakeholders it was a really politically

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,889
sensitive environment always lots of

00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:33,269
high stakes with lots of passion i

00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,940
facilitated a number of

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:38,010
multidisciplinary meetings during that

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,500
time and I was actually completely

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,410
untrained and in the deep end most of

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,049
the time but there was one night I

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,579
gathered community members police the

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,120
state government the local mayor

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:53,190
executives and consultants we were

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,260
talking about rail grade separation and

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,099
you can see some of the images up here

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,379
from the project that I was working on

00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:05,489
what happened during that meeting was a

00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:07,199
complete train wreck it's likely that

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:12,030
all of us have been involved in meetings

00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:14,129
like this at some time the leaders in

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,039
the room the executive and the like

00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:19,650
pulled rank and just played to their own

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:22,440
interests they shut down the community

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,659
leaders whose sensing this started to

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,210
shout louder during the meeting the

00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:30,169
chair was taking sides and I was really

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:33,000
devastated by how this meeting unfolded

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,530
so what I learned that night was that

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,479
you know they're really sort of

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,750
carefully planned tools that I'd put

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,550
together my gender my powerpoints all of

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,610
my planning

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,690
everything that I had developed to rely

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,860
on to get this you know really disparate

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,620
multidisciplinary group to a decision

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:59,090
was actually completely useless because

00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:01,920
working with really diverse groups is

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,860
super complex there's always a lot

00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,450
that's at play so you know I knew I was

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,030
missing something and that I was at a

00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,890
crossroads and that there was something

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,440
that I needed to learn to actually

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:17,040
enable me to better get groups on track

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,840
I also suspected there was something

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,950
that I needed to let go of to make this

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:27,720
possible as well so I reached a choice

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:30,330
point this meeting was decisive for me

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,460
because the pain of it was really great

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm sure all of us have been in a

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,840
situation where you know you're working

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,850
with a group that things go wrong and

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,350
it's a really unpleasant experience and

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,610
it was certainly something that I made a

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:45,000
decision that I didn't want to

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,280
experience again what I'd really wanted

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,400
to achieve in that meeting was to enable

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,970
all voices to be heard and I'd really

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,600
failed at that it's an experience that

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,550
many of us faces founders as well often

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,340
you know we start off on adrenaline with

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:05,250
a really great idea we get traction we

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,160
raise funding and then comes building a

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,170
team and building a team requires a

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,050
whole different set of skills because

00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,150
it's really about facilitating multiple

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:20,100
multiple voices and perspectives at any

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:22,680
one time so in my many years of learning

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,600
after this meeting I did discover a

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,760
couple of things that I'd like to share

00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,560
now which have been up on the slide

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:32,190
there firstly when things go wrong

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,920
particularly when you know we're

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:39,200
Gathering is groups of humans what we

00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:42,810
usually do is jump to two tools to fix

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,830
those problems we create new rules and

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,330
we offer incentives Australia is one of

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,910
the most regulated countries in the

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,699
world and is really an exemplar of this

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:58,210
approach of you know creating

00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:00,040
to fix problems my earliest training was

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,650
actually in Community Development and

00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:06,250
social activism back in my early 20s and

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:10,389
101 of our training was a model that we

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:12,790
call in the business the resistance line

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:16,330
so I just give you all a moment or so to

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:18,669
have a look at that the resistance line

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,430
is actually also known as the terrorist

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:25,389
line and it was developed in South

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:29,710
America I think in the 60s or 70s and by

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:32,050
a number of political activists activist

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:36,000
movements at the time you can see what

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:39,310
the resistance line shows is that um

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,900
there are all sorts of techniques that

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:48,639
we developed in order to resist rules

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:52,389
and resist incentives I'm sure every

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,389
single one of us at some stage has dug

00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:57,100
deep onto the resistance line but put

00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,680
your hands up if you've ever done any of

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,200
those behaviors on the line there I

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,889
think most of us have at some stage I

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:09,160
certainly have hmm now at some stage in

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,990
our career or in our families will be

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,240
asked to do something and we don't

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,270
actually agree with it but we don't

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,080
actually say that instead what we do is

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:23,080
we get on with the task but we do it

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,450
really slowly and we make a few cynical

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,539
jokes about it along the way these are

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,760
very very subtle signs of resistance and

00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,260
particularly my daughter who's in neural

00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:37,390
Eman at the moment is doing this very

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:38,979
well regard to homework so the thing is

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,190
though when resistance becomes

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:44,470
entrenched our typical reaction then is

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,400
to get angry to get frustrated and full

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:51,400
of fear and then our response is

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:55,000
generally to try to control the behavior

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,800
and then start to seek to motivate

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,920
people through various different

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,589
incentives I'm really oversimplifying

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,750
this scenario and of course it's very

00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:06,370
different for you know different

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,110
contexts and different organisation

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,540
particularly those that have been

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,029
practicing collaboration for a while but

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:20,890
and I think you probably get the sort of

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:23,410
scenario that I'm painting yeah that was

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,890
my sliders resistant behaviour in a

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:32,380
meeting

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:34,120
that's Obama so why this is useful and

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,839
important for us to be talking about in

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,360
the context of collaboration is that our

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,980
resistant behaviors come from a really

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:49,470
deep human need of sovereignty you know

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:52,270
of agency it's a very basic human right

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:56,140
and when our sense of sovereignty or

00:09:52,270 --> 00:10:02,410
agency is compromised then we start to

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:05,650
resist and in this context the

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,810
resistance is actually about having our

00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:11,410
own sense of agency noticed and

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:14,380
validated and acknowledged and so in in

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,930
this context Rosen incentives aren't

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,580
enough of a response because they don't

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,890
actually address the issue that's at

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,750
hand and in fact what they start to

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,450
create is a downward spiral into

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,370
mediocrity where teams and groups lose

00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,400
their ability to improvise and feel

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:37,110
engaged and most importantly to feel

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:40,510
trust so when we start to talk about

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,130
collaboration and this whole sort of

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,670
future of work narrative of which

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,900
collaboration is an important pillar

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,959
what we're really talking about is a

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,990
moral dilemma because collaboration

00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:56,200
actually requires a distribution of

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,480
power and it's this distribution of

00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,029
power that really unlocks value in

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:06,910
innovation and new ways of thinking and

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:09,420
feeling and acting equally it requires

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:12,490
for each one of us to practice

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:16,089
accountability to be clear on our role

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:20,910
to take responsibility for speaking up

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,910
and to participate and to emphasize

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:29,720
so then collaboration really becomes a

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:34,160
series of polarities do I let go of

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:40,730
control or not do I listen or not do I

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:46,160
finish this task or not really becomes

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:54,770
about our ability and our moral will to

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:56,630
be inclusive or not so when we go back

00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:00,260
to the story I shared about the meeting

00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,970
and then I ran all those years ago and

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,400
when I'd asked myself that question of

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:08,360
was there something that I might need to

00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,840
let go of to make or to enable all

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,120
voices in that meeting to be possible

00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:19,520
the answer really was that I needed to

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,470
let go of my desire to take control and

00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,440
that what I really needed was to learn

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:28,640
the types of social technologies that

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:33,430
enable me to distribute power to create

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,930
those participative environments where

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:39,800
everyone's voice can contribute to the

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:42,200
outcomes so that kind of brings us full

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,740
circle back to you

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:48,890
mmm the hypothesis that we were holding

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:52,880
and stepping into this work with inspire

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:56,270
9 a few years ago I guess what we really

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,730
started wondering was if we were able to

00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:01,540
design and run a program that increased

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:05,600
the sense of agency and awareness of

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,970
group dynamics then we'd get much better

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:16,190
and more seamless happier collaboration

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:20,660
in teams and the like so the program

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:23,350
that we ran with inspire 9 had 12 people

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:27,350
involved including startup founders

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:30,200
employees of startups freelancers people

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,250
from a really diverse walk of life over

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,240
four weeks we learned

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,880
tools that really help to raise our

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,980
awareness of unconscious behaviors and

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,190
patterns that we're really shaping

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,240
unwanted outcomes in the way that teams

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:51,270
were working and then we were

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:54,000
interacting with clients and the like it

00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:57,120
was a really um embodied practice that

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,520
we ran with this group of people so it

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,510
was very much about action learning so

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:06,720
between sessions we actually sent you

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,220
know students out to practice tools that

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,250
we taught and I'm about to share some of

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,250
those tools with you um in a moment

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:21,570
so the first collaboration tool if you

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:25,620
like and that we shared with the group

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:28,290
of inspire nine students was a tool

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:32,130
called the four player model has anyone

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:34,140
ever heard of this I'm just struggling

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:39,540
to see you know looks like it's pretty

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:43,650
new for us the four player model is

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:47,780
really interesting because it's a tool

00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:51,000
that enables us to recognize patterns in

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:54,120
behavior and conversations that then

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,880
enable us to form empathy and empathy is

00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,900
a really important quality that

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:04,140
underpins collaboration this ball player

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:07,440
tool actually helps us to start to see

00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,670
the unconscious behaviors that are

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,730
happening in the way that we're working

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,960
with others so as you can see on the

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,420
screen though we've got our terrorist

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,960
line what we were hoping to do was start

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:21,000
to like an earth wisdom and potential

00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,940
from underneath that wisdom line through

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,510
the use of this tool so I'm just going

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,710
to run you through this tool a little

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,210
bit and then we're just going to have a

00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,400
break for a moment and I want you to

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,650
turn to the person who you're sitting

00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:39,660
next to to have a bit of a discussion

00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:42,660
about it so the fall player model is

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,440
underpinned by a notion and this might

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,770
be a bit tricky to grasp but

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,810
underpinned by notions that within every

00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,480
sort of conversation or human

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:56,840
interaction there are four archetypes

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,420
that underpin that conversation or

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,090
interaction they are what's on the

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:06,020
screen they're the mover the follower

00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:07,910
the oppose at the bystander now each of

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:12,320
these archetypes bring a particular

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:14,780
quality to the conversation and now roll

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,630
I suppose as facilitators a facilitative

00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:20,840
leadership is really to enable the flow

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:23,030
of all of these different moves or

00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,750
archetypes in the conversation to flow

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:29,230
in a way that's generative so for

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,400
instance the mover is a really important

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,770
archetypal play in the conversation

00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:39,590
because they bring the authentic voice

00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:44,150
they bring cut-through in action and

00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:48,040
traction and they're often sort of

00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:50,120
visualized as a as a statesman

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,910
then there's the role of the follower

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,030
and this is the role of listening and

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,240
the follower brings completion and often

00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:03,260
the sort of an archetypal image of the

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:06,050
follower is that of the lover so there

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,970
is there is service to a conversation or

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:12,230
to a project and the like and they bring

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:15,680
completion then there is the the play of

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:18,949
the archetype of the opposer the opposer

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,810
has a super important role in most of

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,439
the work that we do because the oppose a

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:27,290
calls for respect and often the opposing

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:31,580
is that person who drives you nuts

00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:34,610
because they ask so many you know really

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:38,090
technical questions nothing we can sort

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,230
of like throw those questions off but

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,560
really what they're calling for is

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:46,430
respect yeah and then finally there's

00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:50,180
the role of the bystander who is I

00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:52,910
suppose often known as that quality or

00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,180
that archetype of suspension so the

00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,310
bystander really invites us to hold

00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,620
perspective and often when we're holding

00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:04,190
perspectives that will shine through in

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,080
terms of asking questions that unlock

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,850
potential and shift the context that

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:13,400
we're in to see things differently so

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:17,270
I'll just move through those but as I've

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,820
just described what I'd really love is

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,630
to do for a moment is just as

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:26,720
individuals as I go through these slides

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:29,810
have a read of them have a look at sort

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,680
of the intent and the impact of each of

00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:35,810
these moves and just reflect to yourself

00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:39,110
what what move am i most dominant in

00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:42,470
when I am collaborating and what move

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,420
might be or play might be absent I

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,650
suppose in my team or in my work

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,700
environment when when I'm collaborating

00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:53,780
so I'm gonna run through and just

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:56,110
everything so we've got the mover the

00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,110
follower

00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:11,589
the opposer and the bystander so if you

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:14,229
can just take a moment now that you've

00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:17,409
had a bit of a think about that um and

00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:22,239
turn to the person next to you and see

00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:24,669
your name and just just share what what

00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:27,690
play resonated with you and why we'll

00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,690
take 10 seconds

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,550
did I talk that long

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,220
so we might need to wrap up then there

00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,649
is there anyone who's willing to just

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:20,110
shout out something that they shared or

00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:22,869
heard one brave person who's going to

00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:36,580
express this sense of agent agency

00:20:22,869 --> 00:20:39,029
through shutting out Paden just what did

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:51,369
you share or what did you hear about

00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:52,990
what play you might be yeah so I'm you

00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:56,350
know often we're just playing it safe

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,909
and seeing ourselves in different roles

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:04,330
at different times is there anything

00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:05,080
else it's very new material I can

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,139
understand that

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,179
um I'm just going to wrap up now because

00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:13,090
it seems I've talked longer than I

00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:18,179
thought I had and I guess just to get to

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:25,600
some of the key points very quickly of I

00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:28,149
guess what was most valued by some of

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,350
the participants of the program that we

00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:34,570
ran so we asked questions at the end

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,090
around what problem people walked in

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,519
with what changed what had shifted and

00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,019
through learning and tools such as the

00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,330
full plane model which I've just gone

00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:45,809
through now and certainly this was some

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:48,129
of the feedback that we heard

00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:50,409
participants you know leading in

00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:53,889
networks program said things like now

00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:56,049
I'm more assertive I have more of a

00:21:53,889 --> 00:22:00,779
reflective practice so rather than just

00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:04,200
reacting to things I'm noticing patterns

00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:06,460
and responding accordingly and that

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,619
before going into a really difficult

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:11,590
conversation or plan it out before

00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:17,440
launching in because just by way of

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:19,930
closing I'll share the following model

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,670
that we've developed really to just

00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:26,650
give us a sense of the the pattern of

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:36,940
collaboration and the different aspects

00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:40,480
that are important yeah the reason why

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:43,660
we decided to show this model right here

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,100
at the end was you know there was

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,910
something around the way that we were

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:53,440
able to build trust in working together

00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:56,620
with the participants at inspire 9 and

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,820
what we really saw was that as you get

00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:02,950
to know other people and you start to

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,230
improvise to take risks you start to

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,120
surrender a little and when you start to

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,970
step into a place of a bit of surrender

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,370
with another person and start to let go

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:15,340
of some of that control and then letting

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,760
go of some of that control we start to

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,470
let come new insights and behaviors and

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,930
in sharing those insights and behaviors

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:25,510
and we're more likely to improvise and

00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,640
take risks more and through this

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:31,390
behavior we really do start to tap into

00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,300
our collective wisdom but really none of

00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:37,530
this is possible if Trust doesn't exist

00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:40,960
and really Trust is something that is um

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:43,030
built through growing our own sense of

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,400
agency and our own awareness of what's

00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:49,960
happening around us in terms of group

00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,790
dynamics particularly I've spent most of

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,770
my career building what we call

00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:57,940
structures of belonging

00:23:53,770 --> 00:24:00,690
so creating social platforms where

00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,090
people can really have a sense of

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,220
belonging to a whole that enables them

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,860
to soften into that place of surrender

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,350
and for the benefits of collaboration to

00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,700
flow on and so I better leave it there

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,920
but thank you so much for your time

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,130
today

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,130
