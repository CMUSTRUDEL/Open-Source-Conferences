Description: 
	A unit test walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders ten beers. Orders 2.5 billion beers. Orders -1 beers. Orders a nothing. Orders a cat. We spend a lot of time thinking and talking about how to write better code, but much less time on how to write better tests. Over the course of my career as a JavaScript developer Iâ€™ve worked across product teams, project team and operations. This talk will leverage my experience in each of these roles to examine how unit tests are a critical component of robust, stable and maintainable software across the full lifecycle. We'll do a deeper dive into some of the theory around unit testing while relating it back to business value and agile practices. I will also give opinionated practical advice for writing a robust test suite.
