Title: Justin Falcone: The Origin of HyperCard in the Breakdown of the Bicycle for the Mind
Publication date: 2017-05-19
Playlist: JSConf AU 2016
Description: 
	Thank you to Mozilla for making video recording possible.

HyperCard was a programming tool for non-programmers that inspired much of the design of the early Web. However, the spirit of HyperCard -- the blurring of computer "use" and "programming" -- has been lost as the web has become a mainstream consumption-centric medium. This talk imagines an alternate timeline, where our tools have evolved to empower everyone and not just developers.

	00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:15,519
good morning right so what is it that we

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,560
like about computers how do we how did

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,220
we all come to fall in love with them I

00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,410
think we've all got like stories right

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,489
you know for some people it was they the

00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,710
first time they saw like desktop

00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:27,939
publishing they realized that you know

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,820
you could you could make a magazine

00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:34,060
because you cared about like design and

00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,950
writing not paper and glue for some

00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,269
people it was you know they the first

00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,940
time they played a video game there is

00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:42,940
Oh in this tiny little machine there's a

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,949
whole world inside here and you know

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,500
what lucky few of us have been on

00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:48,820
cyberspace you know we've had the

00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,289
experience of like oh I just sent

00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,750
somebody an email on the other side of

00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:54,010
the world and it it got them

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,589
instantaneously that's it's it's an

00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,730
incredible sensation

00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,800
they're running theme in all these is

00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,839
that in these origin stories is how

00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,969
computers they empower people by

00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:06,520
removing physical constraints they let

00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:09,220
us live in this this willy wonka land of

00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,020
pure imagination and this is what this

00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,820
software its finest this is this is why

00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:17,080
Steve Jobs calls the personal computer

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,900
the bicycle for the mind but all these

00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,700
share a fundamental limitation we the

00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,100
programmers we sing these worlds into

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,560
existence for users to inhabit but the

00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,570
users they can't really go beyond what

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,640
we give them there's this there's this

00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:36,250
gap between using and programming now

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,200
this this is my this my origin story

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,050
this is how I came to love computers I

00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,640
think I think you know I'm talking to

00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,140
programmers I think that we all have you

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,380
know first program something along these

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,900
lines but you know if we want to go from

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,270
you know printing butts forever to

00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,530
actually making the software well you

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,380
remember what that was like it's it's

00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,630
it's it's it's it's a it's a process I

00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,310
mean so when somebody comes and say I

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,420
want to make my own software well what's

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,420
what's the next step after this

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,940
and believe it or not this this is a

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,200
huge advancement over what we what you

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,060
know home computer programming was like

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,850
even ten years ago this is worlds away

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,860
from like writing 6502 assembler but you

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,480
know most of us we've all had to deal

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,460
with something like this but you know

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,550
this is just insurmountable arcane for

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,800
most people now it reminds me of this

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,800
cartoon how to draw an owl

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,180
but you know this is honestly if this

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,170
was what program was like it you know

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,840
program is even worse than this because

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,670
you know I can't draw a beautiful owl

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,550
but I can draw this you know this thing

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,020
that looks kind of like a parakeet you

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,250
know you know and you might not be able

00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,680
to draw a beautiful hour but you can

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,840
still draw recognizably recognizable if

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,430
you know kind of shitty one there for

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,230
most people these drawing skills these

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,880
are sufficient these are useful you know

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,010
even if we can't draw this beautiful owl

00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:02,570
we can draw you know diagrams and maps

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,730
and this cool-looking s you know I wrote

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,739
a pretty dire novel in my early 20s but

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,120
like I'm still fairly confident in my

00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,400
ability to write shopping lists and

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,430
thank-you notes and you know code you

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,140
know I know nobody's gonna say that I'm

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,550
I'm illiterate because you know I wrote

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,950
a thinly-veiled memoir instead of the

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,540
novel I thought I was doing you know him

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,700
full of us will go on to draw arrows the

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,510
right way and write real novels but like

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,670
you know we don't claim that only

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,260
novelists are illiterate and but for

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,120
some reason programming is treated

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,610
differently most of our tools they're

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,010
not designed for noodles and shopping

00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,299
lists and our culture expects people to

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,910
learn how to draw without ever learning

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:40,070
how to doodle I wonder if this is

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,290
because a big part of our culture wants

00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,440
programming to be hard wants us to be

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,940
like this elite class we view any tools

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,070
that claim to make programming easier

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,500
with suspicion that's well that's not

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,570
real programming that's dumbing it down

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,610
is like you know you can do this but it

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,769
is for noobs you know people haven't

00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,420
paid their dues we all want to believe

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,519
that were these like perfectly rational

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,620
iconic class but we're desperate for it

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,000
to find any orthodoxy to cling on to and

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,510
just use it as a cudgel against anything

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,670
actually you know new I can't help but

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,380
see this fasten to our culture it's like

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,840
school boys who are perpetuating these

00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,000
generations old hazing rituals but you

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,130
know no matter what we do we we look up

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,500
to Jack Straw and they just glowers back

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,030
at us you know he's still disappointed

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,020
that you know we're not writing formal

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,360
proofs of our programs so so how do we

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,220
bridge the gap between users and

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,530
programmers now there's there's two

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,289
sides of this one that's technological

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,580
one that's more cultural now in the tech

00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,740
side I'm going to talk about a tool

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,599
called HyperCard you know first what it

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,110
looks like today and second what it

00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,220
could look like

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,319
in or what can lead to in 2016 25 years

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,150
from now then we'll look at the the

00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,490
harder part the ways that our culture

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,620
will need to change in order to get from

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,039
here to there and fulfill the promise of

00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,289
a bicycle for the mind

00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,030
so HyperCard it's a it's a tool for

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:04,939
building simple programs that use cards

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,759
and stacks is the central metaphor so

00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:09,319
the presentation I'm giving this a stack

00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,539
you know these buttons on the bottom row

00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,879
here these are like links to other cards

00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:18,710
in the stack and these icons here these

00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:21,050
are links to other stacks you know a lot

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,659
of the you know this is one of the

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,610
example stacks that comes with HyperCard

00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:28,009
a lot of most the example stacks end up

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,139
being like basically just like fancy

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:31,729
databases but you're you know databases

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,990
with a nice UI but turns out like a lot

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:37,039
of software is just databases with a

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,699
nice UI and you can just like go through

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,409
pages

00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:42,979
the interesting thing here is there's no

00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:44,750
distinction between there's no like data

00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:47,449
side of the presentation side any any

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,069
output field is also an input field you

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,599
know this has some you know obvious

00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:51,879
weaknesses for you know programs when

00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,960
you if you think about list from

00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,710
abstraction purposes but it's really

00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,889
hard to be for simplicity and you can

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:02,210
insert a new card I'm just gonna put it

00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:04,520
in my I'm not gonna put my actual

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,190
address because this is you know I don't

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,289
want to get junk mail but you know and

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:13,849
it just uses the it day all the cards

00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:15,740
can share like a background and so if we

00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:17,210
go to if we go into the background mode

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,569
you see that little stripes here that's

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,270
no no this is the this is the shared

00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,860
background used by all the cards or in

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,479
that or we're thinking the cards in this

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,279
section so this is this is the primary

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,339
system of abstraction and hyper card

00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:36,550
now I'm gonna redesign this or I'm going

00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:38,569
to redesign this and fast motion it's

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,779
actually quite tedious to watch this in

00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:43,339
real time it's a lot more fun to do but

00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,490
yeah and you can change the background

00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:48,620
you'll rearrange all the icons or in the

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:53,680
fields and it's your it doesn't you know

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:56,350
all the data updates to match it

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,729
so now yeah layout of cheese the content

00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,590
remains we can add some stuff for the

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,970
foreground so let's uh let's make a

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,830
button that links back to the

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:11,500
presentation there you go

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:15,729
I'm very fast at typing there we go now

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,770
now did we just program what we built

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,840
software but we didn't code anything now

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,100
hypercard it actually does have a

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,220
programming language built into a called

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,860
hyper talk but you know so on here we've

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,389
got this here this just like hides a

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,979
minibar in the tool window and I open up

00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,650
the stack so it's more presentation II

00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:34,120
and then this one this block of code

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,940
here this is so it works with my

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,740
presentation remote but you know I need

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,970
to write this this this code because

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,820
I've been doing some fancy stuff but

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,680
like this is not an essential part of

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,660
like the hyper hyper media authoring

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,150
experience you know you don't you don't

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:53,349
need to do this to be productive I mean

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,759
you know also just an aside I really

00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:59,830
like how they handle the event handlers

00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:01,449
here I hope somebody copies that even if

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,190
you even if you end up writing a little

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,970
bit code you don't have to write a lot

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:09,010
of it it's a you know HyperCard

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,930
what it does is it blurs lines between

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,770
you know between programs and documents

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,970
between databases and you eyes and and

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:21,220
most imporantly between programmers and

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:23,260
users but now now the what it could be

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,270
so so hyper here it is it's not perfect

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,039
it's it's it's back only it cost kind of

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,210
a lot of money as some pretty severe

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,729
limitation to the programming

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,669
environment and really have time to get

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,930
the specifics but you know natural

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,430
language programming I think of the the

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,690
advantages of having like English like

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,159
syntax is overrated

00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,750
also hypercard doesn't have any data

00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:45,370
structures everything is a string but

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,720
don't worry about that but you know what

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,180
the important thing is that it proves

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,279
that hypermedia can work in the real

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,080
world unlike real home computers you

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,209
don't need every every hypermedia system

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,830
for this has been some experimental

00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:58,750
thing that was like done at a university

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,730
or like in a lab and it's like well this

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,050
could work on if everybody has like

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,920
these you know $70,000 0x Altos however

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,200
but you know I'm

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,269
really excited about we're HyperCard and

00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,310
it's you know successors can go in the

00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,860
future so so let's explore that future

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,850
so what we'll hypermedia look like in 25

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,380
years now

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,269
again the technology said because we can

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,500
bet pretty common pretty confidently

00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:26,050
that computers are going to be much

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,730
faster much more powerful in the

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,310
information superhighway it's gonna be

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,630
faster and more widely available but we

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,399
need a little more

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,709
I know vision to imagine a world where

00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:40,269
there's no the wisp reduce barriers

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:41,800
between users and programmers so for the

00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:43,360
future technology side it's the only I

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,130
want to answer like how well today's

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,500
users become tomorrow's hyper media

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:50,800
authors and how well today's partner is

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,870
us how will we empower them and we look

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,449
at the other user friendly programming

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,550
environment spreadsheets we see a few

00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:59,649
key characteristics u1 they they allow

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,000
direct manipulation there's no separate

00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,550
data and presentation modes it's all

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,800
what you see is what you get that direct

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,019
manipulation enables non-programmers to

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,579
explore you want to try something out

00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:11,800
you don't need to like convince a

00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:13,149
programmer to build it for you you just

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,779
you can just do it yourself

00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,769
and this then means that programs can be

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,899
transient than you look because the

00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:21,550
problem is the program isn't a product

00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,380
it's it's a it's an artifact of the

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,660
exploration project process it's like

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,920
it's like having a sketch or a study for

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,449
an artist now but but even when your

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,300
tools enable rapid development

00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:36,160
distribution challenges can conform can

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,930
force to be slow and ponderous so like

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,699
Excel and hyper card they can make it

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,769
very easy for an individual to sketch

00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,970
software after themselves but you know

00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:46,000
distribution still involves getting

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,860
boxes with disks into stores and that's

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,709
still real time and real money and

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,810
there's no which really limits your

00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,560
ability for or limits your space for

00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,110
experimentation

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,550
you know fluff now I think this is this

00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,110
is really apparent in the the package

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,390
hyper media based software you see it

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,920
today so for some reason hyper cards

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,529
Anisha is becoming this like this

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,680
extremely like high culture educational

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:10,870
software like so this is a Beethoven's

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,560
Ninth Symphony CD companion and it like

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,089
it walks you through like all the like

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,980
in here it's like talking about Sonata

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:18,600
form and how it

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,339
nice symphony him you know don't get me

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,899
wrong it's excellent software but it's

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,310
not representative of the kind that

00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,470
everybody's gonna be writing I mean not

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:29,010
not everything we make has to be a

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:31,589
monument now if we put hypermedia on the

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,180
internet then the distribution problems

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:34,829
kind of fall by the wayside now software

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,070
travels from my computer to yours at the

00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:40,920
speed of light modulo how fast a 9600

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,329
baud modem can decode but free from the

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,350
burden the permanence what could

00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:48,120
hypermedia based software look like well

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,889
I would expect a lot of the people

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,079
making traditional me today we'll be

00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:53,940
making hypermedia tomorrow and a lot of

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,800
what we do today with newspapers and

00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,360
magazines and like you know alternative

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,449
weeklies and stuff those would be a

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,250
natural fit for hyper media hyper cards

00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:03,990
tool in you know currently hyper cards

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,149
tools for layout content not like

00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,410
particularly sophisticated they're

00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:08,910
honest a little primitive but I can only

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,800
imagine that like as they mature they'll

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,300
become as as sophistica as anything that

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,449
you'd see in desktop publishing you know

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,860
like in court or in PageMaker

00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:18,149
there's there's no way we're gonna

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,850
regress on this front I mean can you

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:24,029
imagine if we needed a programmer to

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,949
move something over three pixels now if

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:27,959
we if we focus more in the exploratory

00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:29,850
angle I mean it could be the basis of

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,769
new tools for thought you know new like

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,389
brainstorming mind mapping this sort of

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:34,949
thing a lot of the early visions of

00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:37,170
hypermedia all going all the way back to

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:40,680
the the Memex in 1944 an event of our

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,760
Bush's article as we may think this is

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,010
exactly what they were they're they're

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,800
this their systems for like academic

00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:49,199
research now like scholarly works for

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,600
example they could show analysis and

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:52,800
primary sources side by side like you

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,839
know you oh I need to make direct

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,910
connections between the ideas in their

00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,860
context now this can be useful you know

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,240
both for the researcher organizing their

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,110
thoughts as they write the analysis as

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,550
well as those who study it down the line

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,529
but that's some obvious implications for

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,990
journalists to I mean imagine if every

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,250
fact cited a news story could be linked

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,600
back to its source with annotations

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,550
explaining the relevance

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,050
I mean you know the global hyper media

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,180
network it could it could assure in a

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,470
new era of it informed audiences and

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,470
maybe even voters

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,790
now I don't want to focus entirely on

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,649
work now empowering users you know we're

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,180
not just our we're not our jobs it goes

00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:35,160
beyond helping you do your work

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,290
I remember media can help your life can

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,100
help us with self-expression and

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,089
exploration know the cynics in the

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,589
audience for all you say well yeah this

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,149
was the same promise of desktop

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,680
publishing too but you know as I

00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:49,139
mentioned before digital publishing it's

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,879
kind of a misnomer it's and it's desktop

00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,319
page layout but publishing that still

00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,319
has to go to a you know a service bureau

00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:57,540
for printing its you know the making pjo

00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:59,310
accessible does not you know solve the

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,980
distribution challenges but with with

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,629
the but with hyper media but with with

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,370
the over the Internet you know a global

00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:07,230
hyper media network makes personal

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,879
publishing really accessible now we

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,230
won't all be members of the professional

00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,750
media but perhaps we'll be able to

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,170
participate in a new kind of social

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,170
media

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,900
[Music]

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:27,570
so the the other question I I posed was

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,030
how well today's programmers empower the

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,920
hypermedia authors I see our work in the

00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,930
future to be a lot like the role of

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,120
hardware and system software today we're

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,860
providing the infrastructure that all of

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,570
this depends on we're like we are the

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,460
substrate and we're gonna be building

00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,410
the tools that hypermedia authors use

00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,880
you know the low-level primitives and

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,610
like the widgets that they use to

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,590
compose their work you know right now a

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,200
lot of this comes from the first party

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,580
so in addition to hyper card itself and

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,080
the hyper talk language Apple provides a

00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,510
whole bunch of like ready-made buttons

00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,910
and fields and stuff this is the this is

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:02,460
what I guess you would think of as like

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,320
hypercard standard library

00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,590
on a sidenote they also provide some

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,860
fantastic clipart it's not all animals

00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:14,340
using Apple computers but there's a lot

00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:18,870
of that but but first parties can't

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:23,160
provide everything there's you know

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,990
there's a there's there's a small

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,240
community of third party widget makers

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,800
today but as the world becomes more

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,240
connected this community's gonna eclipse

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,340
and eventually dwarf the first party

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,680
contributions now all of these people

00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,930
sharing these widgets they form an

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,790
ecosystem all the individual components

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,620
become connected and support each other

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,930
as a whole I like to think of this is

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,550
like a synchronous collaboration where

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,020
people who've never met nevertheless

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,110
become interdependent on each other's

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,610
code that it sort of realized that the

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,300
ecosystem is gonna need to work at both

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,400
ends

00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,740
you know publishing and consuming for

00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,060
people with the wide range of abilities

00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,530
you know with the way we imagine this

00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,820
maybe that you know the author's gonna

00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,960
be using the widgets and programmers are

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,970
gonna be making them but the universe is

00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,620
gonna be true as well programmers are

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,420
gonna want to use the ecosystem for

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,970
their own projects you know you know

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,290
sharing code and authors are gonna want

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,390
to share with us that they've modified

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,730
or compose from from smaller pieces so

00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,110
it's important that these users will

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,940
have different needs and workflows that

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:21,450
still have like the same goals we need

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,280
to accommodate that also the herbs

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:25,020
abstraction isn't necessarily going to

00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,580
be as small as widgets you know and

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,960
sometimes you know common workflows and

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,650
widget collections will aggregate into

00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,960
frameworks

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:33,210
your knowledge bases in online magazine

00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,220
and adventure games they all work pretty

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,200
well within the rubric of hypermedia but

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,820
each has a specific set of needs and

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,770
these were gonna develop their own

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,140
standards and ecosystems even like

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,440
social mores within those of hypermedia

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,200
as a whole this widget and free more eco

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,610
system these are gonna be an on-ramp

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,110
into traditional programming for a lot

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,460
of people as they move from you know

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,200
doing little bits of scripting here and

00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,850
there to you know writing business logic

00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,190
to actually modifying the core of the

00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,630
projects they're using if there's any if

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,390
there's any one thing that I think is

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:07,020
gonna make bridge the gap between users

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:09,630
and programmers is it and now the hard

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,110
part what we need to change in our

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,790
culture to enable this growth so is that

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,220
as I was researching the history of

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,050
hyper media I noticed a common theme

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,620
running through the foundational text

00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:24,540
you know a sense of responsibility in as

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,680
we may think Vannevar Bush was he was he

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,370
was actually on the Manhattan Project

00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,840
and he was writing this you know as he

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,700
was developing the atomic bomb and he

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,140
was thinking about he was he was trying

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,930
to come to terms with how much of his

00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,810
work during the war had been he had been

00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:42,000
making weapons and he was by no means a

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:45,300
pacifist but he understood that his work

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,130
was not neutral you know but he saw that

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,710
building weapons you know was his

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,480
responsibility in wartime and in

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,600
peacetime healing the world was his

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,590
responsibility but we've programmers we

00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,230
don't talk a lot about our

00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,180
responsibility I mean we're not making

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,470
atomic bombs but we can still we can't

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,920
look at how much everything has changed

00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,870
in the 70s and 80s and act like that you

00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,520
know we're not making an impact you know

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:12,900
so it's good someone's bad but none of

00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,910
it is value neutral and while our world

00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,460
is becoming increasingly dependent on

00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,320
software the creation of that software

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,690
isn't becoming democratized if anything

00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,060
it's heading towards oligarchy it's as

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,660
programming becomes more and more of an

00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,130
elite in credential field the software

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,840
industry it's it's it seems to be

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,180
recapitulating the excesses of the

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,910
Gilded Age only with you know technology

00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,890
as the lever of class stratification

00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,600
instead of railroads and oil now a lot

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,070
of you are probably saying like I didn't

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,270
I didn't create this world you know we

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,150
didn't start the fire it was always

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,830
burning since the world's been turning

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,050
and you're on your right but this isn't

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,120
it's not about guilt or who started it

00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:53,490
it's that we're all parts of this

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,040
machine now and we participate in its

00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,920
operation unless we are actively

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:02,370
fighting against it we are in some ways

00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,260
supporting it we support the system when

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,760
we abdicate our agency when we write

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,230
software that harms our users because

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,450
it's just a job

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,160
we support the system in the work we

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,110
choose not to do when we decide that

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,790
nobody really needs hooks for

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,470
accessibility or customization or

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,210
composability those are you know

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,790
empowering users that's not providing

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,230
business value and we support this

00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,180
system with the teens that we build

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,620
we're all familiar with the phenomena of

00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,090
hiring manner saying oh well they don't

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,770
actually know anything about the banking

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,540
industry you'll learn business on the

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,450
job immediately followed by five years

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,920
C++ experience required then we act but

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,060
then then we act all surprised that

00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,160
we've got these teams full of people who

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:42,330
think like us and act like us and let's

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,800
face it look like us so I keep coming to

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,020
the back to this this notion of a

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,420
bicycle for the mind so here's the full

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,830
coat and there's Steve Jobs I read a

00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,690
study that measured the efficiency of

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,610
locomotion for various species on the

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,950
planet the Condor used the least

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,690
efficiency to move at least energy to

00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,190
move a kilometer humans came in with out

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,380
rather unimpressive showing about a

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,970
third of the way down the list that

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,320
didn't look so good but then somebody at

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,480
Scientific American had the insight to

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,890
test the efficiency of locomotion for a

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,590
man on a bicycle on a man on a bicycle

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,030
blew the Condor away that's what a

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,350
computer is to me the computer is the

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,330
most remarkable tool that we've ever

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,570
come up with it's the equivalent of a

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,160
bicycle for our minds now this speaks me

00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,600
in a couple of levels I mean you know

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,280
not only is the you know the bicycle a

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,500
tool of the human increases human

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,110
ability but it's a fundamentally

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,790
democratic one too I mean you can sink a

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,350
lot of money into a nice bike but even

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,870
cheap single-speed huffy will get you

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,330
around it's a machine that is eminently

00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:40,130
fixable and understandable you suitable

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,809
for children at play and adults at work

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,570
the commuters we have today are not

00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:46,429
bicycles instead we've got something

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,049
more like I know a car for the mind

00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:49,520
which you know it gets you around that's

00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:51,320
easier and more comfortable than a bike

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,289
but at what cost

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,669
you know when America decided that it

00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:57,559
was going to be a place for cars

00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,480
we signed ourselves up for urban sprawl

00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:02,570
and air pollution and car crashes and

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,120
oil Wars even on a human scale cars are

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,830
as much liabilities as they are assets

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,419
and I'm sure we all know people are

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,370
working terrible jobs to keep their

00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:13,610
junker car running so they can get to

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,650
their terrible job now what happens if

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,809
we go on with our lives without taking

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,360
responsibility well it's supposed to

00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:22,039
technology changes as dramatically as as

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,659
I'm predicting here but our fundamental

00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:28,309
culture remains the same well I see a

00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:30,440
world in which computers are a thousand

00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:32,750
times more powerful powerful than today

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,000
and they fit inside your pocket but the

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,220
tools for building software are the same

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,039
our King text editors we've been using

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,900
since the 70s I see a tech industry

00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,340
serving a generation that grew up with

00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,710
computers and understands them

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,480
intuitively distributed all over the

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,610
globe and yet the industry itself is

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,890
like some kind of nerd Country Club with

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,500
disposable immigrant labor at the bottom

00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:58,700
vampire billionaires at the top and for

00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:00,200
some reason you and for some reason

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:07,000
everybody has to relocate to San

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:09,580
Francisco now in my darkest moments

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,740
I see a world where everyone is

00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,840
constantly connected to a global hyper

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,870
media network where every movement is

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:21,670
tracked every behavior is analyzed so

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:23,920
advertisers can better deceive us that's

00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,110
where we're headed but we can change

00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,140
direction even if we're still on this

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,580
trajectory in 2016 we can still change

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,830
this story computing is filled with

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,870
small teams having a huge impact the

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,550
entire xeric spark organization who

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,110
could fit inside this room the first

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,360
version of HyperCard was made by a team

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,950
of five people for all we know that the

00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,350
technology that dominates the next 25

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,760
years could be I know a documentation

00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:49,000
project at a European particle

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,130
accelerator these these innovations are

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,750
as much cultural as they are

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,400
technological I mean the systems

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,720
designed at xerox were marvels of

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,870
engineering but it's not the code that

00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:02,370
endures it's their legacy is a culture

00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:04,540
of user research and humane design

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,520
culture is not an artifact it's a

00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,790
process that needs to be enacted it

00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,630
needs to be embodied we all know how

00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:12,610
groundbreaking new technology can

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,080
struggle in the face of misunderstanding

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,930
and dismissal and fear uncertainty and

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,420
doubt just imagine how much pushback new

00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,760
cultural concepts must necessarily get

00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,550
it's our responsibility to recognize

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,890
adopt and evangelize new social mores

00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:31,870
with same enthusiasm and tenacity as we

00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:33,120

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,710
visions of the future

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,000
one where we build a global hyper media

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,520
network to bring the power of

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,930
programming to ordinary people and one

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,900
which we use up to make some rich guys

00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:46,300
even richer the basic technology is the

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:50,280
same all the difference lies and how we

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,280
choose to use it thank you

00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:54,330
