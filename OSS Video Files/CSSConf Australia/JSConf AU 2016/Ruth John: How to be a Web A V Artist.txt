Title: Ruth John: How to be a Web A V Artist
Publication date: 2017-05-19
Playlist: JSConf AU 2016
Description: 
	Thank you to Mozilla for making video recording possible.

JavaScript is everywhere! It’s jumped out the browser and into the world around us. You can find it in hardware, music, art, museums and even on aircraft! In this interactive talk we take a look at a project which took JavaScript to the streets, projecting live visuals to music in a Portable Audio Visual Pack.

We’ll break down the software built for the project, which involves audio triggered visuals using the Web MIDI, Web Audio and Web Animation APIs, with anything you can think of to build in the browser: Pure HTML & CSS, SVG and canvas, plus video and images. Then we learn how to mix these visuals, to music, live! You’ll even have a chance to get involve yourself, using your own device - it is the web after all.

How do you pick this all up and carry it around the streets you ask? Don’t worry we’ll cover that too. Come and play with some fabulous street art code - it’ll be fun, you’ll learn some cool JavaScript and you’ll be inspired.

regulators regulate any feeling of this

00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,690
property with damn good too but you

00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,070
can't be any gigs off the street got to

00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:30,650
be handy with the steel if you know what

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:35,079
I mean ergy keep regular 00 timing that

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:40,999
is so hard right hey Jess conf Australia

00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:45,499
yeah thank you very much hello i am

00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:48,409
route that was that I'm done thanks and

00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:54,879
ok oh no I like I like that in through

00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:57,620
ah so yes normally at the top of a talk

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,929
people would introduce themselves so to

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,760
say what job they do what sort of

00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:04,640
credentials they have what they doing

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,130
day today I kind of think it's probably

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,460
easier if I just show you so that's what

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:14,719
I'm going to do so i'm here today to

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:18,259
talk to you about being a web AP artist

00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:20,390
i know right what like what even is that

00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:22,009
to be honest with you I kind of

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,259
struggled with the practicality of this

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,420
talk I was sort of seeing at home I was

00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:29,689
like they're gonna they're going to

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,979
listen to some crazy stuff and they're

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,210
going to go back to their jobs and

00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:33,950
they're going to be building websites

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,299
and web apps and progressive web apps

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,079
and web things a lot of things they do

00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,500
and not really going to be doing

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,759
audiovisuals they're all going to go

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,189
back it'll be like hang on a minute

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,399
scopus maybe in this website it would be

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:47,539
super cool did anybody see this Venn

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,799
diagram is going around the internet

00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:53,270
recently practical dev treated this I

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,009
just realized I forgot my coffee one sec

00:01:53,270 --> 00:02:02,899
I have a little read of this Venn

00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:04,780
diagram coffee is important honey so on

00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:08,750
the right there we've got like what is

00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:12,530
what it in conference talks right and on

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,659
the left is what is useful to be in

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,629
conference talks and as you can see

00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:18,760
there's no overlap so I was thinking to

00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:21,400
myself what I

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,069
do was make two lists based on the

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,450
diagram so this is on the lessons of

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,459
things through a boy so these are things

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,379
that happen in conference talks which if

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,510
I can avoid in this talk will be useful

00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,220
because I can include all the stuff on

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,510
the right so that's all the stuff that

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,890
will be useful to you as developers

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:42,730
right so a void analytics operational

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,200
excellence shaft ops orchestration I

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,939
think I can avoid that stuff that's

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:52,510
great but I do have to include duct tape

00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:55,840
workarounds bike shedding coffee right

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,819
cool okay so now we've got the torque

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,049
anxiety bit out of the way and I know

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,379
I'm going to have to include and what

00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:06,190
not to include we can begin what is a

00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:10,030
where baby artist so a V stands for

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,670
audio-visual right so a be so audio

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,549
visual artist is somebody who sort of

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,530
puts viduals or create visuals based on

00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,209
audio so it's a little bit more towards

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,560
of visual n drive than the audio end

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:24,959
even though we do work with a little bit

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,400
of audience another word for this is bj

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,699
does anybody in the audience remember

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,340
this weird Eminem it really whips the

00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:36,400
llama's as yeah so I've people to pay

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,959
their hand up I'm so brilliant any of

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,400
you that don't remember I can see some

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,829
young faces around in fact I thought

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,319
most of you are actually this was the

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:46,750
mp3 player choice back in the day when

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,000
we actually used to hold like audio

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,519
files as hard files and didn't stream

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,819
them it's a really really lovely

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,470
lightweight sound player which is why we

00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,109
chose it it literally just does play

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,540
sound files but this wasn't the best

00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:05,319
thing about winamp the best thing about

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,470
winner with this there it had a

00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,750
visualization engine so you play your

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,220
music and you'd fire up this engine and

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,489
it would show you all these amazing

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,049
visuals that when in time to the music

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,659
this was probably the most influential

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,190
thing of any VJ of my generation we've

00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,870
always just used to sit there now when

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,180
it because we can make this this is

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,610
amazing like visuals billion time of the

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,530
music this is great but I'm going to

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,430
take you through the techniques that I

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,010
have used to

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:37,060
kind of try and recreate the idea behind

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:39,430
list within a browser so the first thing

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:43,240
that we need is audio right and we've

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,420
got this with the Web Audio API now

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,580
there's four main ways to get audio with

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,980
the Web Audio API we can create a sound

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,650
so we can create an oscillator which is

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,270
essentially creating a sound wave and

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,830
that's a way to create sound we can add

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,420
sort of effects afterwards and can

00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,800
change volumes and panic and all this

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,070
other lovely stuff to get the audio api

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,770
but that's the first way we can grab it

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,900
from a dom so we can get it from an

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,960
audio or video element and we can pipe

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,700
that into the audio api we can stream it

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,650
from a media stream source we saw this

00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,270
in soledad earlier we can just type it

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,250
in from our camera or a microphone and

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,130
we could stream it into the Audio API or

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,620
we can actually buffer it from a file so

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,620
we can load a sound file into the Audio

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,110
API viral buffer there laughter two are

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,460
probably or the latter three are

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,140
probably the ones that we kind of want

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:38,220
to look at for when we want to analyze

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,220
which is the next step so two ways

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,360
regulators and he's regulated ceiling of

00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:48,400
his property with damn good too but you

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,440
can't be any geek off the streets I

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,639
gotta pee handy with the feel if you

00:05:50,440 --> 00:06:00,009
know what I mean her cheeky ready oh

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,050
great so that first way I was loading in

00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,120
a sound file and I was analyzing that

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,970
sound file this second way is picking up

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,080
on my mic so it's actually analyzing the

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,550
sound of my voice going and that's the

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,190
next bit that we need once we've got

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,370
sound that was almost the easy bit the

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:22,479
next that we need to do is analyze it

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:25,510
right I'm not allowed to talk about

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,889
analytics so I kind of failed on the

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,300
first and already but it's fine we've

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:29,620
got like three more I can tell you to

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,120
get this talk done without actually

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,020
getting all this wrong it will be

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,270
amazing so yeah we need to analyze them

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,410
it is probably the most important thing

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,360
of the stuff that we're actually going

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,910
to do and we can do that with the Web

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,550
Audio API as well so there's an analyzer

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,620
mode if you don't know much about the

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,940
Web Audio API all works within nodes you

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,560
have like input nodes you have

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,389
modification know to have output nodes

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,710
so the input nodes was what we were

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,800
talking about earlier with like loading

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,419
cells sounds in modification those are

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,490
things like the analyzer mode you've got

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,449
volume changes you've got filters as

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,639
lots of things you can do with that

00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,110
sound and then there's outfit knows it

00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,120
for the majority of the time as your

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,039
speaker and you kind of string all these

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,650
nodes together and that's how you going

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,770
to use the audio api so the analyzer

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,270
mode gives us frequencies analyzers

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,210
frequency so frequencies are like tones

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:22,449
it's like low to sort of high and it

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,340
goes from not hurt to 20,000 hertz so

00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,789
that's the range that the human ear here

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,680
you might not hear 20,000 hurt when you

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,870
get a little bit older I know that I

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,760
probably can't hear 20,000 Hertz and

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,860
actually music doesn't really go up that

00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,570
high so you'll be fine but that's what

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,550
the analyzing those gives us back and it

00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:43,000
gives us back it back to us in an array

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,199
so we create an array we give it we give

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,150
it to the analyzer mode and then that

00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,130
gives the facts of volumes of each of

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,840
the frequencies that we like we can

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,460
break that way whatever size and the

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,790
bigger that we make me erase the better

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,830
resolution of

00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:59,750
analyzing that we get so it's pretty

00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,670
simple to make something like that once

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,230
you've got all that information this is

00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,510
just a bunch of I element sitting in the

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,070
DOM and all i'm doing is looping over

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,260
that array and looping over the I

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,820
elements and attaching one part of the

00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,370
array to each one of the I elements and

00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,350
as the sort of velocity or the volume of

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,150
each frequency of going up as if the

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:22,190
height of each of the I elements pretty

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:25,070
simple set bit but this is kind of quite

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:28,250
powerful stuff because we're using the

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,510
DOM and it done is pretty cool so I sort

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,850
of started playing around just with this

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:35,210
simple idea to start with and we can add

00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:37,250
more stuff later this is a pretty cool

00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,229
office please super cool artist says it

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,970
on slide two she asked me my name is

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,280
bridget riley i discovered her in

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:46,280
Scotland earlier this year and she don't

00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,080
use like huge big paintings which are

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,280
quite simple and effect when you look at

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,500
them this is about you can see in here

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,790
they're just kind of lines but the way

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,130
that she doesn't mean to their sort of

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,530
movement through these lines and when I

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,630
saw them us would haha I kind of want to

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,390
make those into visuals so I did that

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,790
this one's cool this is just checkers

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,380
again it's just dorm elements so we're

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,360
just changing the width of those Dom

00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,740
elements based on like the sound and I'm

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,050
still doing anything when I'm picking up

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,820
on my mic so this is picking up on the

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,420
sounds that I'm getting and analyzing it

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,920
and then changing the width like it's

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,230
dependent on what frequencies I'm

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,890
passing it in but we can expand on that

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:28,450
two triangles beauty trying go they'll

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:31,340
end right triangle Yemen which is like

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:33,350
because we're using a browser reusing

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,270
the Dom there's some other like great

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,580
things that we have with that there's

00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,600
some great lovely CSS things which is a

00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,780
great thing to talk about as a

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,030
JavaScript conference tag bones so I

00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,420
thought it would be really nice if I

00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:49,780
could grab whatever was in the dawn and

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:52,430
reflects that and rotate it around and

00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,120
we could do some like symmetry which

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,820
would be great for like any visuals so I

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,440
did do that do this again it sort of

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,470
slashes in time with the music so if I

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,940
go quiet kind of disappears and then

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,860
when I go loud again it comes up but

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,300
it's just if you

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,649
transforming it's just grabbing their

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,720
the function it just grabs whatever's in

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,079
the Dom and then the flex and rotate sit

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,110
around I wish I brought this I thought

00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:21,430
wonder if I could put a given this yeah

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,890
we could do that cartoons man always do

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,450
cartoons there is so this is just

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,920
exactly the same code and we're just

00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,279
dumping a dip in and it's just very

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,290
taking and reflecting it around prices

00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:33,850
are so good for sorting other things

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,190
that we get with the SS now are things

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:39,220
like blends and filters it's a really

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:42,670
nice so this is very suited to what we

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,810
do and the opening i started with

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,670
earlier with these pictures of the

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:50,230
speakers these are using both blend

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:53,709
modes and filters so Phil if you aren't

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:56,529
aware lens are sort of a transparency

00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:58,269
layer over your elements if anybody has

00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:00,070
used Photoshop and user mode should be

00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:02,829
very very familiar with them if you have

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,670
an interested as the nice of veneer over

00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:08,529
like your foreground and your background

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,940
so you've got like mixed blend mode as a

00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:12,310
property which you can put on your

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,720
element there's also background download

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,000
if you've got sort of background images

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,920
you can use them in that way as well

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,899
there's also filters so the pictures of

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,269
the speakers actually do you use the

00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,829
sort of contrast filter which is picking

00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:26,140
up on the analyzing and making it

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,940
stronger and weaker as it goes but the

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,370
filters are very good for things like

00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,410
images especially good for video you've

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,180
got things like grayscale inverting

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,850
blurring like all this kind of stuff

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:40,899
which is it's really good when you want

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,810
to put that in time with the music I was

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,850
talking about CFS and we're going to

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,370
carry on but wait for it it gets more

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,170
interesting custom properties right so

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,690
we have cost and properties and CSS now

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,730
so this is sort of like variables they

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,949
are now quite exactly the same but they

00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,560
are you declare them at the top of your

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:01,000
CSS file and then you can use them

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,860
throughout your CSS much like you would

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,250
with a preprocessor I'm sure we're all

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,449
familiar with it so something like this

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,610
uses a lot of the stuff which I just

00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:11,260
described it's just sections of I

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,850
elements in and then I've rounded them

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,160
off and then I've rotated them around

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,620
but the width and the height of them is

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,100
changing like dependent on a custom

00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,139
property

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,970
I set when I'm changing the custom

00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:25,300
property with JavaScript and that's

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:27,940
going directly into my CSS this is kind

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:32,259
of fun this is JavaScript all up in your

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,759
CSS right so with this is top is the CSS

00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:36,130
we were declaring this variable like

00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,440
slash bash level and then at the bottom

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,709
here this document document elements

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,079
tileset property I'm actually passing in

00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:45,610
one of the frequency velocities so when

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,170
they gets louder or softer it's actually

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,290
changing the level and actually changing

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,730
my CSS directly I think I like someone's

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:55,990
through bit at the bathroom that's like

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:58,449
robots so that's that's really really

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,279
interesting now there's one thing to

00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:02,199
note about this technique I don't know

00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,930
whether you realize this is actually a

00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,730
gift because to put it within my slide

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,709
and to actually have it running is

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,560
really really hard because it's not very

00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:13,569
common what I'm not that's talk about 40

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,480
operational excellence not allowed to

00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:19,800
talk about performance okay fifty

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,180
percent down it's okay still be alright

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,319
custom properties when you're using them

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,730
with sort of widths and Heights and

00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:26,500
you're constantly polling them they're

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,449
not very performant I found this out the

00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,279
hard way when I was talking about this

00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:32,680
is my friend I was chatting for my

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,889
friends not allowed to talk about chat

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,750
with fiber yeah I've got one more to go

00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,490
let's talk about orchestrated i think i

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,620
can get away with it i think i can end

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,329
the talk with just orchestrated left I

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,850
think we'll be all right hey this is Ben

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:48,310
this in my friend Ben and I was talking

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,509
to him about performance because i

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,120
thought i did this interactive

00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:54,300
installation at jessica's ill and there

00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,829
was one thousand five hundred attendees

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,250
which is a lot of people to do something

00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:01,720
interactive with it didn't really work

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,319
chrome doesn't like 1500 people

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,519
connecting to it so he kind of helped me

00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:09,100
out and he went through my code and i

00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,689
got home and he was doing some really

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,519
really cool stuff with d3 at the time

00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:14,050
and we had a talk from that yesterday

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,209
about d3 so it's really really

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,250
interesting to see his take on it and

00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:20,079
its really good to talk to your friends

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,819
and our stuff and show them your code

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,889
because then they introduce you to other

00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:26,230
things and then your whole world kind of

00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:28,480
expands which is cool DD kind of

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,069
entities me if I did it might be better

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,910
for some my visuals as far as

00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:34,210
performance go

00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,980
so apt is really really good at data I'm

00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:39,040
using a lot of data and doing a lot of

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,290
analyzing of frequencies basically data

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,850
it's also really good with dumb stuff so

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,470
we use it for a lot of SD Jesus is on

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,940
the list here but actually it's quite

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,130
good just working with the dorm and

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,900
making that performance also really good

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,670
at math super important if you're

00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,560
working with data it does have a lot of

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,600
sort of manipulating for the methods and

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,810
functions but it was really interesting

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,840
to start using it this was my

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:05,700
inspiration for my g3 set this is a book

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:08,680
called super graphic it's all to do with

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:11,020
it sort of takes data from comics and

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,670
graphic novels and sort of puts them in

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,410
just it's just a lovely books of 62 it's

00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,360
just data visualizations from comics and

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,860
graphic novels it's really cool but it's

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,660
really interesting because it becomes

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:23,650
really really easy so make things like

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:26,110
this like which a they look really good

00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,910
on your word a lot of base but this is

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,500
just a really simple d3 example and

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,480
you're just moving it around just based

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,370
on the frequencies and then you do

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,440
accidental animation which is actually a

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,450
thing so this is one that went wrong but

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,250
actually it looks really nice so it's

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,930
super happy with that and then this

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:46,510
one's kind of a rich person actually

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:48,190
with quiet this one's thoughts yeah it's

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,050
really i'm wondering whether my radius

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,000
masses a little bit out but as many

00:15:50,050 --> 00:16:00,070
showed me yesterday you can put yeah

00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:01,720
whoo you can put had moved on it that

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,400
was so cool and so glad to show me that

00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,050
was like yeah and they're made to go

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,480
white when it's really loud I can change

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,510
the volume of the microphone at school

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,550
and then we just have simple ones yeah

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:17,380
quite like that it'd be really nice

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:18,940
overlay for video I think I wanted to

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,470
talk just very very briefly about the

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,480
analysis that we're doing on the

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:25,750
audience this is probably the most

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,270
boring part the talk we are creating a

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:31,810
linear array of values from north herts

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,220
to 20,000 hertz most music it will not

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,620
go out to take out of it probably won't

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,930
even get 45 thousand Hertz plus we have

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,910
a linear array so we kind of need to do

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,650
some math on that analysis we need to

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,510
break that array down we can probably

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:46,270
take the first quarter of those

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:50,470
and we also need to spread it out it's a

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:52,900
linear array music is not linear music

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,550
is logarithmic or scale right if you

00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,160
actually play a piano and you go from

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,900
one octave to the next octave for people

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,670
that aren't musical that means you're

00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,440
going from like the same space to the

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,810
next place to the next place you're

00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,910
actually doubling frequencies you're not

00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,949
going up like 1230 actually doubling

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,690
that makes it got a logarithmic ileana

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,430
I've only just started thinking about

00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,380
this so I'm going to be doing some work

00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,780
around the mass and hopefully making

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,579
them a lot easier to use for the

00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,550
analysis which could hopefully mean that

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,079
things like beat detection low frequency

00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,270
mid frequency and high frequency

00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:29,650
detection within the actual sort of

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:31,360
software and visual ways could be a lot

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,950
easier I thought I did some pseudo stuff

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,440
on this one and you can see it's kind of

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,450
it's spread out a lot more so I've kind

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,810
of broken this array down if we jump

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,910
back up to a little this one this one

00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,240
husband and you can see how it's kind of

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,740
bottom heavy almost so the red on the

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,120
bottom there is there's a lot more

00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:54,010
activity in that end of the array we're

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,020
just fine for visuals I think in the

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,030
short term but i think if we actually

00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,770
want to do some proper analysis like i

00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,970
said beat detection we're going to have

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,220
to sort of think about that a little bit

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,300
harder and there's only does something i

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,860
was thinking about in the past couple of

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:10,240
days oh cool we've got visuals if you

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,610
want to do more of these I did Cove

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,970
ember this month and there's a big

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:18,940
collection of them on code pen including

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,130
some of the ones you just saw that so it

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,990
kind of easy to create visuals right we

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,730
can all agree that was fun we've got

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,070
some analysis we made some pretty cool

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,620
stuff to it but we kinda want to control

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:32,830
them as well and we've got a keyboard

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:36,280
connected to our laptop but that's not

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:40,240
really exciting as a web MIDI API that's

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,190
more exciting so I really did a quick

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,480
background and MIDI so we all are aware

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,950
because I'm sure there are some people

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,260
in the audience that don't quite know

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:52,510
what video midi is not a tease VP music

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,700
midi is a data protocol that came around

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,290
in the 80s because there was a rise of

00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,590
electronic

00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,240
in the 17th and so industry expert and

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,710
music manufacturers got together and

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,110
they said wouldn't it be really really

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,520
nice if all these instruments could talk

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,320
to each other because they're all

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,640
electric you would think that actually

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,560
we could find a protocol where they

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,270
could all talk to each other and not

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,860
just to each other but go into recording

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,050
studios and talk to recording equipment

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,630
as well and that's how many came around

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,860
the first leg was general MIDI one it's

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,240
kind of moved on now we have general

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,280
journal really to there's a lot of other

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,400
specifications as well but for the most

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,080
part that's what midians it's just

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,850
passing numbers back and forth between

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,340
equipment and this is work right through

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,830
the web api a web MIDI API as well if

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,750
you plug a MIDI instrument or controller

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,700
into your computer you are just

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,860
essentially if you run the code getting

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,360
numbers which makes it quite powerful if

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,370
you want a hardware enable your browser

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,910
I would recommend playing with it if you

00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:51,600
want to one thing to bear in mind is

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:56,160
this is a MIDI instrument orchestration

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,500
for instance fine ok this is literally

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,140
like the most useless book ever right

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,060
now ok we'll go with that this is a MIDI

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,130
instrument ok MIDI instruments have

00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,480
on-board audio I'm sure you've all seen

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,970
one of these this is the keyboard you

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,310
try it plays music it probably has these

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,780
days probably has a USB port so you can

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,280
plug it into your computer and if you

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,350
run code in the browser you can actually

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,000
feed back midi information into your

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,920
browser so our normal musical keyboard

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,150
up cool the difference between that and

00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,460
something like this which is a launch

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:27,150
pad if this is a controller there's no

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:29,520
onboard audio right for the most part

00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,320
these are slightly cheaper than

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,730
instruments you can actually pick up

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,540
keyboards pretty cheap these days but

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:38,430
for the most part these are the Foxes

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,320
this is my handbag midi controller and

00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,610
then put it too far away from my

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,820
computer because it's Bluetooth so it

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:47,760
might lose connection this is a

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,320
bluetooth-enabled one so there's no USB

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,940
connection but it should be still

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,260
connected to my browser fingers crossed

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,510
and it's just buttoning there's a nice

00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,040
little crossfade on here so I can kind

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,230
of use it with my visuals please let

00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,480
this work to kind of cross face and go

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,370
from one visual on to the next visual

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,590
I'm hoping we can kind of we'll see this

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,960
at the back so all I'm doing is this

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,320
polling these values

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,419
CC controller just passing me numbers

00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,669
when it gets to one side for sharing one

00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,990
visual when it gets to the else all I'm

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:20,289
saying that visual and then we can

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,730
cuddle stop in the middle income service

00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:25,760
which is super handy if you want to mix

00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,260
visuals life right there is some yeah

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,059
that's a nice effect on the buttons as

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,649
well so you can like flash in dirt and

00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:32,870
things like that you can set these

00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:34,460
buttons up to do whatever you want for

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,289
the most part I generally set them up so

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,000
I have different sets so I load

00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:39,470
different things into the div I have

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,110
some effect and that I can cross phase

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:45,710
between them super handy bit of clip

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:49,520
have fixed me from 10 now that's how we

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,399
control dividuals great but is this is

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,250
this is all real this is such a hobby /

00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:59,270
right this is me I have a pocket

00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:02,299
projector so I created like an usherette

00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,950
tray bag that opened up with my laptop

00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:05,299
and my midi controller in and the

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,429
projector projects out from the bottom

00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:09,710
and this is me projecting onto the

00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:11,390
streets of my 50 last year we did it at

00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,549
Christmas it's cool and just playing

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,610
music just walking down the streets just

00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:18,049
projecting business I love the button

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,700
you guys are laughing there's an article

00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:21,760
about this on playful ways if you're

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,289
interested in it it's like how I made it

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,179
but really though I started a collective

00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:29,179
good like Jess so this is all different

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:31,970
people doing live things built with

00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:33,770
JavaScript matt is here today he's doing

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,630
stuff tonight with some stuffy built

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,520
that does live music I'll let him talk

00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,620
to you about it tenders and stuff with

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,779
LEDs which is amazing Martin does

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,240
controlled lights javascript is great

00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:46,850
like they all do their own thing and if

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,380
it's amazing last last week rajesh

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,270
khattar Asia I think Thomas is here in

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,490
the audience yeah there has been waving

00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:56,510
he organized he invited us to do it we

00:22:52,490 --> 00:23:00,830
did a gig we didn't get it's like yes ok

00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:02,419
you think this is a hobby well we'll be

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,299
doing some stuff than I as well so hang

00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:09,110
around this is how real is we have a

00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:11,929
github organizations defo real right

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:16,130
when you go get hub organizations it is

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:17,659
getting real I am actually toting my own

00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,880
software based on all the things you

00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,830
just saw so the analyzing music and

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,149
making that better

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,230
controlling it was meeting be able to

00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:25,330
hook up different midi controllers

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,130
through it including things like video

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,169
there's a lot of video my set these days

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:32,200
as well as all the animation stuff which

00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:33,580
is just throw in the talk I have liked

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,010
to both and have a really really happy

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,419
version which I have been just using as

00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,669
a sketch pad for the past eight of 18

00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:41,169
months which is on my github if you

00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:45,159
wanna look at the tape I would wouldn't

00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:47,169
not nice I'm rebuilding the software and

00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,850
or beyond this organization if you want

00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,980
to see it I'm not going to show you a

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,630
demo within this talk because matt is

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,510
doing some stuff later tonight and I

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,100
will be doing projections for it for the

00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:59,169
after party so if you want to come up

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,610
and see and chat to me I will be here

00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:03,250
there will be projections on this

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:07,330
projector will be amazing there's one

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:10,360
last thing I would like to address most

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:15,340
useless together so far right but for

00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:17,320
their keen-eyed among these duct tape

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,299
not actually holding the bag up the

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,710
harness really works there's updates

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:29,230
pelletizing the laptop to the bag spends

00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:31,179
on a bike does the work run into my
