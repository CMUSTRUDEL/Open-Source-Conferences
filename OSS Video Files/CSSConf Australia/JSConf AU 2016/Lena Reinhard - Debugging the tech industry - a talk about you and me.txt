Going into the year 2017, what does it mean to work on software today? - No matter if we're software developers, designers, product managers, leaders, or work on software in any other way: our work has impact. But how is this impact constituted, what does it look like in practice - and what does all of this mean for us?

This talk shows why we need to understand and care about the social and ethical implications of our work, and highlights ways for approaching these topics - by ourselves, and in conversations with the people we work with. This talk wants to encourage you to think about your role, your power, and your responsibilities. You'll learn what you can do to live up to them - and how you can help debug the tech industry.
