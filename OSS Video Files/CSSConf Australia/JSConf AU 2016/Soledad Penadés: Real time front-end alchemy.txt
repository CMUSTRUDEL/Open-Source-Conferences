Title: Soledad Penadés: Real time front-end alchemy
Publication date: 2017-05-19
Playlist: JSConf AU 2016
Description: 
	Thank you to Mozilla for making the video recordings possible. 

As new features are added to the Web platform, the kind of experiences we can build become amazingly interactive and immersive—a huge leap forward from the static document based web of yore.

Nowadays we can access webcams and play 3D audio and graphics, all in real time and in the browser, but there was a missing piece: capturing and encoding! Most solutions involved either sending data to servers or porting C++ encoders to JavaScript, none of which were particularly efficient or desirable for privacy or performance reasons.

Thankfully there is a better way: the new and shiny MediaCapture API, and in this talk you will learn all about it. Streams will be no strangers to you anymore, and you might even be tempted to cross a few of them—just for fun!

excellent hi-yah that was a very good

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,189
transition I am very impressed my

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,349
coaching abilities have worked nice so

00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:21,360
Spanish names have this thing where most

00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:22,950
of the work and like have the stress on

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,310
the last syllable so it was a coaching

00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,360
mark with like how you say my name and

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,619
it actually worked

00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,989
so that's really great I'm going to use

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,890
it all the time so yeah I'm so happiness

00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,300
I am Spanish I work in London I'm not

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,000
too jealous because I was in Singapore

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,950
last week but before I continue there

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,650
are moving images and looks and maybe

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,450
awful some feedback here so if you have

00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,560
tinnitus if you get sick with these kind

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,490
of things please leave now I'm very

00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,460
sorry but sometimes life audio-video is

00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,950
unpredictable so I don't want anyone to

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,840
feel unwell so you've been warned if you

00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,370
leave now I will be feeling upset about

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,379
that so I work at Mozilla I found this

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,009
gift in this place called gift cities

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,780
there are mazing things in this website

00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:12,060
and actually the reason why is so sharp

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,070
and anti-alias because I'm using a CSS

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,620
property to like no interpreter which a

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,570
gif is like very very small someone in

00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,440
three matches perfect step tools from

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,620
making that better and I really like is

00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,270
making video and all this stuff so I

00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,200
have this website where I have all sorts

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,820
of cool things I do and so like I did

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,460
this thing some years ago and basically

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,200
about using your camera to make gifts

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,520
which you might kind of recognize

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,479
because it's kind of extracted from the

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,799
code of made spaces so this is the kind

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,210
of things I like so when I have a liquid

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,460
do the same thing with me to record and

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,930
like oh I'm going to totally take that

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,000
as my definite thing so I've been which

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,299
I change a thing for the last from

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,210
lecture about a year last year about

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,759
this time someone from the web RTC team

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,320
in in Firefox approached our team the

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,570
deferral team which was my team but them

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,399
then I hey we have this new API you may

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,989
we you might be interested in like maybe

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,049
try it out and making a demo or

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,609
something like oh I can finally capture

00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:17,129
what I'm doing on the browser so the

00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:17,660
super code so we started playing with us

00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,150
with

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,070
Kollek Belen and we found so many bugs

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,040
we also found that we didn't find

00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,660
documentation because it wasn't in any

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,210
so we had to read it ourselves and like

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,030
dig into things so after a whole year of

00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,800
filing many bugs cracking crushing the

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,840
browser many many times and like all

00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,690
that we are finally ready to talk about

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,480
this kind of like alchemy the whole

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,130
title is very long so stream it's not

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,870
these streams like you can't join

00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,610
registers you can actually join them is

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,500
not this the streams either by the way

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,970
this is a great movie I just watched in

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,680
the plane here and it was like out it is

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:56,540
really cool so not of strange I'm not

00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,090
not really the streams are not feature

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,700
JavaScript similar but media stream

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:06,770
instances and you might be like how many

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:08,360
streams can we have so it's five

00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,680
continents like maybe so that's why

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,410
continents are probably that doesn't

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,990
tell you anything but tracks can be

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,360
audio video so if you mighty Nativity a

00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,340
DVD can have several tracks of audio and

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,840
it's very interactive videos you can

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,970
change with unit scenes which never

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,730
happens because producers just gave up

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,670
on the idea but there's the whole idea

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:31,010
of DVDs like in general streams of like

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,560
media that you can have very structured

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,330
things so you can have any numbers

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,420
tracks per stream that was the premise

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,550
that we got sold the DVDs based on and

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,010
you might actually have to use media

00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,020
script already if you excuse get used to

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,390
me who hasn't used I mean someone has

00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,360
you this stranger how to use it okay at

00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,890
least one person it was what aware of

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,680
what was going on everyone else was in a

00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,380
cave for the last five years I guess

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,030
it would get you familiar you use

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,410
navigator those media devices

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,230
it used to be somewhere else but it's

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,640
been most to be under media devices so

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,070
it's not polluting all the global

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,160
namespace so you call media devices

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:12,980
getusermedia and say audio through video

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,780
through and eventually once the user has

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,419
been asked for cremations and everything

00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,239
you get stream with audio and video

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:22,700
hopefully and i use something with it so

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,220
the user thing that people do is just

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,140
show an image on the screen which is

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,570
cool because back in the days we have to

00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,080
store flash and other things so we could

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,479
display all the

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,580
and you could actually if I connected

00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:42,240
the audio you can listen to me and able

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:45,389
to feedback character okay so your

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,520
theory it should be displaying and I

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,090
know what's going on here but fine um so

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,889
this is boring

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,180
beautiful news like seriously only he

00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:55,860
knows about that and I'm pretty sure

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,050
you're brave all right

00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,250
using coach it's rare to really hear

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,800
boring stuff you can hear through the

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,479
cool things so what we will call the new

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,180
coatings MIDI recording with this API

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,509
will I'm going to talk about today its

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,050
native I don't know what this is like

00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:15,479
everything it's not good for native

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,710
JavaScript API which means I built in

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,110
your browser you don't need to download

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,529
anything you know the middle NPM install

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,020
it's built in and also it's very

00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:27,060
familiar I just use the Dom unlike other

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,129
the listener and the currency or you

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,909
know how it works

00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:31,949
subscribe because you need to learn a

00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:35,129
new paradigm so that's super cool

00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,629
so in a nutshell what you do is you have

00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:38,400
an e constructor which is new media

00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,050
recorder and you pass it one of those

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,080
streams so you can get from the webcam

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,779
and you have methods which are like very

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,940
familiar and similar to like using a

00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,550
record or images like start and stop and

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,409
pause and resume so like if you use your

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,240
from the 80s like me you know how tape

00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:56,909
recorders work so this is the same thing

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,099
like start stop pause and resume

00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:02,339
except the technical base don't give you

00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:04,169
the it available events in this case if

00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,509
you have a listener when they available

00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:08,639
happens when you press a stop you will

00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:11,060
get a block of the data so that's a

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,740
modern thing compared to tape recorders

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,900
so we can reduce this to work off things

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,789
from the webcam and the way you delete

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,860
if you create a recorder with the string

00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:23,969
then you go from the camera various

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,250
critical text to add a listener with the

00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:27,830
data available event and between five

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,259
arrows because why not

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,659
so you get these events and it's called

00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,339
data which happens to be a blob and we

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,529
want to set that to play in a video

00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,380
element which is in the website opening

00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:42,889
so we need to create a URL because I was

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,749
a defeated us in the where the thing is

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,759
so you create a URL for this with this

00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:49,219
objective also exists in the window this

00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,460
is just pure JavaScript API is exist

00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:53,840
from the browser this is not a library

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,400
so you set the source a little video and

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,319
then press once x-play

00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,870
and then this is a particular the

00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,969
listener on the other side you has to

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,279
have the recorder and then we tell it to

00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:06,110
stop recording after five thousand

00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,590
milliseconds which happens to be five

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,749
seconds so if I do this thing starts

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,639
about them you can see because the LED

00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:15,289
is not in your side but it's physically

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,349
and now this is looping and this should

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:26,330
be playing right so this is so this is

00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:29,500
what we gotta do video I can do things

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:33,349
like change in this balance on 22 the

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:36,439
decrement oxygen saturation and make

00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:38,180
sure that it is the most embarrassment

00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:44,870
monitoring no one which makes you feel

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:46,849
like jello so yeah I just call it all

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,729
the originated in the browser and I

00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:51,740
usually use plugins which when I get to

00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:54,199
talk all the time it to me this was a

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,389
mix rope so I could just like goes just

00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,399
like we done with us because I should

00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,719
maybe need to tell you anything else but

00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,050
I'm just joking okay there is more

00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:04,729
content so we just barely scratched the

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,500
surface this is just the beginning of

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:09,979
what you can do because just like

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:13,129
recording videos file it's not fun so

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:14,960
more sources of a stream is get you say

00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:17,539
getusermedia because it is very related

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,069
to the web RTC open everything in fact

00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:22,310
assisting people who are working on this

00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:23,779
so you can share your screen and or your

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,689
windows and you come to court not

00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:29,599
because you just get upstream from this

00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:31,729
so right now this will be we you have to

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,099
wide this domain because you know change

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:36,860
your screen is a very bad idea with

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,769
people in the internet so right now if

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,930
you do this in Firefox we're going to

00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,000
tell you now this mind is not like this

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,550
unless you go to about config and add

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,160
the domain there we are going to change

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,779
that in some communities where you are

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,220
going to fight the user are you really

00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:53,060
sure you want to share this with this

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,670
domain

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,740
four things might happen lalalala so in

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,260
the future this is going to be easier to

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,990
demo right now how to add a table config

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,480
you come to Singapore in chrome if I am

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,100
correct basically the only difference if

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,620
you want to share screens and windows

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,660
itself like you sub media with

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,820
getusermedia when it's the same video

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,529
through you say media source like you

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,600
but you don't object to say media source

00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:19,970
screen or window whatever you want and

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,430
then you get the chrome to face you're

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,850
sure you have to do this so like in this

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,670
case I can use this to demo it BR by

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,980
Jennifer and suppose you want to show

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,320
someone how you you get a bit art

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,300
singing so say okay I want to share this

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,680
type screen and like this is what's

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,980
going to happen are you sure you want to

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,320
do it yeah okay fine so this thing on

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,600
this side is video clips I'm recording

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,130
someone right here so I can try and do

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,170
something here and then I could send the

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:55,279
link to someone be like hey I might

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:57,260
actually hard to record this thing that

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,850
can open this and just I could just rip

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:03,530
up to someone like this is how I did it

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:05,240
so existed so you could you can take a

00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,500
screen share and share and record a

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,330
thing job well now you don't need to

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,680
started trying any you are aware of this

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,890
like if you've done any kind of like

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,870
hangouts this is huge my laptop is not

00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,880
taking off right now there is not a

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,089
massive battery usage to do this thing

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,110
this is very lightweight this is great

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:26,210
so that was one source you can also get

00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:29,420
video cables of canvas if the browser

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:31,339
supports wave so you have this capture

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,790
stream method on process of supporters

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:37,790
so when you call cap system and a canvas

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,320
you can which is optional tell you how

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,260
many frames per second you want to

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,850
capture and then again you create a new

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,459
record where you from the stream that

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,740
you got and if you're into drawing

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:51,350
pixels this is very interesting you get

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,680
a buffer of pixels you go through them

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,209
you add some values lalalala I'm going

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,250
to skip that and then you put it back

00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:00,080
and then you also do the quarter start

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,810
and stop and everything so one going

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,960
here is some kind of magic I'm going to

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:09,730
generate a clip with white noise

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,850
which is considered and then dub a video

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,270
so imagine that you have a game and you

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,830
need people quite nice because they said

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,420
to be on the game and they need to be

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,070
showing a video of White Nights

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,600
if they'll send in the video you can

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,910
generate down your game so you don't

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,570
make the people use their mud with for

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,980
generating a stupid clip so that's cool

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,050
because you can get like really high

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,510
resolution and not having to send

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,000
nothing on down the wire so that's very

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,010
cool and this is generating but what we

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,070
could also do is transform the welcome

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,770
images with the canvas methods before

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:46,839
capturing that so I'm going to do this

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,180
in two steps first I'll show you how to

00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,390
manipulate the images which is the same

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,220
you get the context a cup of context and

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:57,160
roll the video which you got from the

00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,930
welcome into the canvas then you get the

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,149
image later from the context which is

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:04,420
here so that's the pixels without being

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:06,520
the original pixels and then you do the

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,800
same thing you are going through every

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,410
pixel and you are doing we applying this

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,260
cutoff thing which I can change here so

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:17,830
it makes me look less or like depends

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,779
how much Sun has been taken right so

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,580
this is the cutoff thing so the

00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,980
flambeaux am just like tinting which is

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:27,459
not capturing happening here now this is

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,290
a very simple filter but now if you want

00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:31,720
to capture this thing what we need to do

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,300
is call capture stream on the canvas

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,730
that we are applying this throw into so

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,550
some steps from before we need the

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,110
webcam make three streams we copy to

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,810
commit la la la la the pictures which is

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,220
violence TM that white we also get a

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,750
strip from the canvas and eventually we

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,600
call me the recorder for the stream and

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,760
record somewhere to Lucy here so this

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,709
thing is not recording the feedback of

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,320
the demos very bad but this is may be

00:12:53,709 --> 00:13:00,970
encoded in a video like very dark and

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,200
sinister yeah actually we did most of

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,600
the same of this for Halloween because

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,360
it to like make scary thing so why they

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,670
have this sinister thing two of them so

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,760
yeah we have manipulated things and

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,250
caicos of them so we

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,440
you could submit some things to your

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,780
friends and you can even share them in

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,250
Twitter if only to their mr. WebM which

00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:24,800
is doesn't because apparently they do

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:26,600
not have to FF mpg so anyway you should

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,110
not actually use convert it works

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,270
because this is a very small buffer and

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,070
this is very small filter see we are not

00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,480
getting super complicated but what would

00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:39,860
you would you should be using is what

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,360
you what you know things like just

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,750
setting that up would be like half of

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,750
the sort and you don't want to know so

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,670
steps of this we have a third way which

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,550
is the one that I really like and it's

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,950
called media stream of astonishing love

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,950
and we used to make fun of Java class my

00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,960
instable with the predicate is very

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,320
descriptive but it's also very long so

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,750
by main is a media stream for audio it's

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,880
the destination type of loan so these

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:12,110
kind of notes have a dot stream property

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:15,110
and probably you have not much in the

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,150
above above you so what we do is just

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,820
use node in the context that we offer

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:22,040
about the context and so we can modify

00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,890
and capture the audio and all sorts of

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,350
things in real time we can leave all the

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,620
context and what's the global context at

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,720
all tutorials where are you and where

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,760
what is this magic thing but let you

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,170
connect notes that you can create and in

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,140
some of them generate sound some of the

00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,520
modify sound you control becomes split

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,440
things you can join them together it's

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,270
amazing it's very long to explain as

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,800
well many talks that explain these

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,200
things so if you want you can watch them

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,790
or you can ask me questions but

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,550
basically this is how it looks like like

00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,780
you have this kind of graphs and in this

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,920
case we're going to use one of those

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,380
sources which is going to be in

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,840
microphone we're going to do some effect

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,080
some magic and then we will create one

00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,240
of those very long node names and take

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,130
the stream property which is a stream

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,020
and connect the tomato recorder to

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,670
record this thing so we're going to

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,350
input stream all the context which is

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,170
the black box which makes effect and

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,520
then we get the output stream but

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,680
there's a bit too much to take

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,960
consistent with so I disrespect with the

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,510
input stream how do we make this make

00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,790
this thing into the context and then

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:29,950
Recker so we asked the microphone we saw

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:34,360
that we just get user media with the

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:37,150
audience equals true and so we got three

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,830
and then we create an audio context

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,150
which is how you create in creative web

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,190
all the context is comes like a canvas

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,230
context offer audio and then we create

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,990
an input knowledge create media stream

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,400
source compared it with self destination

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,900
so you have the source and you have the

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,270
destination one is for getting a stream

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,490
from the other ways for getting trimming

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,800
and other one for getting stem cells so

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,230
we have this function called make effect

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,750
which makes a block a black box of makes

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,990
some effects and like the guitar it's

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:07,930
pillows so we will connect the input

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,030
node to the effect input and we collect

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,980
the effects output to the OD convict

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:15,160
destination which happens to be mapped

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:20,890
to the speakers and you will see over

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:23,680
here some effects hopefully I was

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,450
talking about so this is an effect these

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,150
black boxes like making some kind of

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,290
echoes cool we want to record this so

00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,290
that we would record this thing it

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,220
instead of collecting the output to the

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,860
destination we will connect the output

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,180
to a node which has a stream property so

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,080
we can induce the stream with a mate

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:45,190
record so we have this ministry will use

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:48,040
the Nationals to reset conspecifics so

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,900
we we have this from before and itself

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,520
connecting to a fiddle destination we

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,620
connect that to the output node which is

00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,330
this and then we get the comida record

00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,950
and say open up stream which is the

00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,770
property we would record under which s

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:02,410
record so London Allah I'm recording

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:07,150
since I recorded here an event you would

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:10,449
stop I can say profiling years in

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:12,250
recorded but this time is not she's

00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:15,730
working even more because this is of the

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,320
thing so we've been able to apply

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,240
effects in real time to the thing that

00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,160
we were doing so using any kind of web

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,690
audio thing you capture that and the

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,339
kind of thing and then we just get like

00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,560
an OGG file you can send it to your

00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,510
friends which is great and I think maybe

00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,340
you could share that in view to the

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:35,080
energy to support OGG probably they do

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,100
because they are not treated so if you

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,330
look at how to do

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,650
an audio but separately and possibly if

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,330
you're like made you want to do

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,900
everything at the same time and the more

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,860
the better

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:50,380
so the problem is that what we doing so

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,030
far is we always ended up with stream

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,250
from the canvas under stream from the

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:56,260
web all the context but the media

00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,940
coverage for Firefox we've seen only

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:02,020
takes one when you do the new media

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,850
recorder successful stream so how do we

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,520
join them because in this case it's good

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,020
to share this Vista streams so how do we

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,730
do this so this was the thing that took

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,110
us longer to find out because there

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,250
wasn't any demo so they were like oh you

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,950
can do all those sorts of good things

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,500
but no one would think of don't document

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:20,380
anything so eventually it just like I

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:26,159
remember I just like often the console

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:29,679
and started doing like new media and

00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:32,100
dream oh that was good the media stream

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,929
worked so I couldn't make a media stream

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,880
which apply me do you have access to the

00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:38,830
constructor which is what we need is

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,440
because once you have access to the

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,150
constructor you can use methods which is

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,220
get all the tracks and your video tracks

00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,230
and add track so I could create a media

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,760
stream and then just like move things

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:53,440
around and like mingle things together

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:55,510
and recombine them as I wanted so the

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,250
good things army record I think here as

00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,500
long as you give it a stream mittigar is

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:02,169
super happy instantly chugging along and

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,270
recording and super meter recording is

00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:09,100
just like very obsessive of recording so

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,679
this is like radical structural above

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,929
what we would do so if we want to do

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,900
these two things and eventually

00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,820
resulting just one stream we start with

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,400
the input stream we get the video track

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,590
and then we do make a stream we update

00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,750
video tracks to the media stream with a

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,750
setup track and then we manipulate with

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,490
canvas lalalala and then eventually you

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,530
get a stream from this and it's

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,090
important to separate you would see like

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,980
why do you want to take the video tracks

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,000
out and it's because if you want to

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,070
manipulate video

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,900
you need to have the video playing but

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,370
you have a video claim if Imus that the

00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,780
video that you're playing is also

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,040
playing the sound so if you want to

00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,570
manipulate the Sun you're going to be

00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,820
listening to the original unfiltered

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,909
class whatever is very strange you

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,590
better have a video without any audio

00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:56,989
track so you can play and then get the

00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,450
frames one each time so that's what we

00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:01,340
have to separate because if you miss the

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,450
video you don't get any sound until it

00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,539
soundtracks it's all very complicated

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,309
and it could be freezing so then on the

00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,289
other side you struck the other tracks

00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,450
pass them to your web or the context

00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:14,690
like after adding them to the audio

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:18,399
track thingy and then again you get a

00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:20,599
media stream blah blah doctor stream and

00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:23,389
finally you just create a new media

00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:25,909
stream and add all the tracks with all

00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:28,849
this monumental for each kind of slope

00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:31,039
and then finally you have all the tracks

00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:33,889
like all your video in the upstream and

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,909
we record the output stream finally so

00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:41,570
we are done and the question is why is

00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:43,849
solid so excited about this video well

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,639
because you can share things with your

00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:48,080
friends but unless you give them like

00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,609
unless the website you're using have

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,799
like a proper URL kind of like

00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:53,809
generation so you can give them the URL

00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,239
and it deputies is exactly the same

00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:58,009
thing they cannot reproduce the same

00:20:56,239 --> 00:21:01,879
setting and some things you cannot

00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:04,999
really like put in a URL it has to be

00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:07,190
like a very long URL for sharing

00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:08,929
something is not very easy if there's

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,450
too much state that you're going to have

00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:13,159
and sometimes people just can't even

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,080
play the thing like if I make a string

00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,359
which is very processor intensive I

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,739
cannot give them a URL to a very dumb

00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,369
thing and make them play that in their

00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:23,960
small phones without battery so it's

00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:25,429
important to be able to recognize

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,570
himself within the browser and also

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:28,489
because you know like people like

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,419
mathematics might want to capture what

00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:30,559
he's doing natively

00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:33,049
he's still having to do work around

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,509
something like that so if you want to

00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:36,619
move things to the web we have we need

00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:38,330
to have a like a feature complete

00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:40,580
browser so this is one of the most

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,979
important things that we needed and this

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,840
this is something the way comes like

00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:47,090
implementing a bit but we have Firefox

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,849
OS so we could record messages and bring

00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:52,099
so much so this kind of like bean for a

00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:53,779
while in Firefox by vs. can click

00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:56,480
incomplete like you have some audio I

00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:58,940
think chrome have some video but like

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,809
only if one has video no one has audio

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,320
it's not as

00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:06,200
compatible API but finally last year

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,090
they got together Chrome and Firefox has

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,499
been working for like really hard to get

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,700
this thing to a point where it's usable

00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:14,869
so it's important because you can

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,109
finally build this kind of sophisticated

00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:20,269
apps will plug into the server side it's

00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:21,399
really fast because you know how to send

00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:24,379
uncompressed data over the network

00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:27,229
because I'm compress it is very huge and

00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:28,580
also because sometimes if you don't need

00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:30,259
to send the data at all you can

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,210
different cool things in the separate

00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:33,950
like in the front side season we need to

00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:37,940
send whatever it is that you're

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:39,830
recording through the wire so you can be

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,960
you know like actually private like any

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,210
videos service workers you didn't even

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,379
need to get it up again because it's

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,669
already off line so you can record

00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:48,679
things and encode them and you don't

00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:52,429
need to wait on to your line to get them

00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:55,279
into a shareable format and also I think

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:58,450
the photography and video apps are kind

00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:01,429
of a big deal like in the Play Store

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:04,009
snapchat is the fourth and the fifth out

00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:05,599
this could be the Australian Play Store

00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:08,989
I don't know how Geographic things work

00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,339
I wasn't signing but in the App Store

00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:13,279
and the AIA

00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:18,200
this is my phone I have 29 days so days

00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:20,690
I just hate spelling update but it's not

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,149
that the fix and Instagram is the 8 so

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,549
it's like really maximum YouTube does it

00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:28,580
count as video maybe okay

00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:31,009
YouTube is the fifth so that's big deal

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,169
like people like taking surveys and I

00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:34,729
don't know I don't think anybody is from

00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:36,109
the UK but there is this thing they do

00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:38,330
the TV where they show some

00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:40,879
interstitials which people does record

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:47,539
their faces with surface and snapchat

00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:50,080
it's terrible i i i heard up yeah the

00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:53,419
guy it's not this big and people want to

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,859
have fun times with their phones with

00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:56,149
the phones but we want things to be in

00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,309
the web so if they won't think that in

00:23:56,149 --> 00:24:00,019
the world need to give people a piano or

00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:02,479
they can do this kind of things so i'm

00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:04,549
saying are ways that you can build

00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:06,139
instagram and snapchat in the browser

00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:09,830
thanks to media corvette

00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:12,769
so that's huge for me and but maybe we

00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:15,349
need another one of those maybe we could

00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:17,089
get more creative instead so for example

00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:19,999
I did get creative

00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:22,729
I built this thing which is kind of like

00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:24,830
a museum like so if it doesn't crack

00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:27,279
which i think is the killing because you

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,279
know better

00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:34,129
hi-yah ice crushed I'm sorry it gives

00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:35,599
you work really nicely ok let's try

00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:37,849
again and this didn't crash the whole

00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,899
thing so let me tell you about Firefox

00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:44,389
Internet is the electrolysis new theory

00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:46,399
is designed to avoid the browser

00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:49,399
crashing completely but I think it's

00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:51,799
taking over the whole thing and I've

00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:54,679
increase of my computer this morning

00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:55,729
just in case okay Alyssa click close it

00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:02,440
click click

00:24:55,729 --> 00:25:07,539
good I click on have I show you my

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:10,039
fantastic collection of names this is a

00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:13,369
the meaning sites you've been meant

00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:19,339
playing as you can see men's playing

00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:21,200
here ok can you please go away I didn't

00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:24,080
have this thing just in case but it has

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:30,529
to be really useful okay let's try this

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:32,649
thing again so what we're saying is that

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:37,549
this thing is very creative very cool

00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:43,519
please show my presentation little bit

00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:46,479
gnarly which numbers the 50 LaBeouf so

00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:51,349
yeah getting creative please don't crash

00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:53,509
okay that's better so sorry series kind

00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,789
of like a museum kind of thing so you

00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:57,950
can have this thing and of course

00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:59,359
looping and I am pretty sure that kids

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,549
love these little things like I said

00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,269
making rhythm it is have too much as

00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:04,269
well bite sizes

00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,210
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,470
it depends on how fortunate you are

00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,940
right now okay

00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:23,160
so if you have a drink you go through

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:25,380
and then last whitcomb this is all of

00:26:23,160 --> 00:27:00,420
the sink agenda it's just records kind

00:26:25,380 --> 00:27:04,740
of like I warned you so we so it is

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:07,920
Lindsay it's just Franco to write short

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,930
sample and it doesn't kind of like how

00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,790
to think with file winner you can decode

00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,650
the blob and bring it back into Abel the

00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,780
ungraded as a sample it's a bit of a

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,460
strain to the tour because it should be

00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:20,040
easier but I just wanted to prove this

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,440
was possible to people in a world a hard

00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,600
day last week in Singapore so the idea

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,300
being that you could just record from

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,770
pause and do like like a big box where

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,360
everybody I have friends that was just

00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,120
like okay we just recording and pay from

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,570
those volumes and frequencies so just

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,870
exiting and apply contract pitch bending

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,970
they think so I found that it was funny

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:44,040
um some more ideas because I have more

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,570
ideas and the reason I open the ductus

00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,810
was to invalidate the cash because

00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:55,110
usually some whole version yeah some the

00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:57,060
report so somewhere idea a big box you

00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,580
could do a bit books you can also do

00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,600
sample-based music app which is just

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,950
like a big book it's kind of like a

00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,060
different type of like you could do like

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:08,610
long track kind of thing if you combine

00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:10,440
it with web MIDI which is like for

00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,090
controlling keyboards and all sorts of

00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,980
instruments you could like to hear the

00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,950
samples and different notes with what

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,919
meaning

00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:20,860
not in firefox but if this bring me the

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,679
recorder works nicely with power we

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,659
could do it more reliably well anyway so

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,760
dictaphones that is a map that we have

00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:29,559
for the moon phase which is a dictaphone

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,380
but it's kind of ugly so maybe you can

00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:35,049
do a nicer one you could do fail

00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,230
recording um it's about going to places

00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:39,850
and recording the sound of this place

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:42,250
and you could use the geolocation API to

00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:45,100
combine everything together they saw

00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:48,669
website called freesound.org has got

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:51,100
many many many many samples you can also

00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:52,120
do the vine up without especially now

00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,039
that they are closing it down

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,320
it was redo this thing if you use a

00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,090
pause and with your methyl of me the

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,360
record over you can do the same in the

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,980
bind off and you could do granular

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,960
language base or your success in

00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,880
synthesis which is a bit of what I was

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,460
doing like if insurv playing the whole

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,590
sample you just play small grain which

00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,570
is smooth bit you can look for

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:17,769
interesting effects and it is very very

00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:20,350
very let's say that it's very absorbing

00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:22,840
you can spend hours just finding the

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,510
best grain and whatever because I am

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,909
trying to music so I kind of like as you

00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,700
can see I've kind of like moving into

00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:32,169
the Rivoli side of things but like last

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,870
week when I was showing these API to

00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:37,230
someone else he was like oh I really

00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:41,529
want to record like he had a video and

00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:42,909
he had like him but he have a carp so

00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,549
she could cover the speed of the video

00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:47,409
he have records himself like skating so

00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:50,260
which is really cool video and he wanted

00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:52,210
to like slow it down like you know like

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,889
like very impressive things if you

00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,649
wanted to record something but turns out

00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:58,240
that for some reason the media recorder

00:29:56,649 --> 00:30:00,039
doesn't take into account the speed of

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,929
the video so we found a bug so we need

00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:03,880
people to have where's new ideas I would

00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:05,529
never think of it as an escape so I

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,250
would never have an idea of playing

00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:10,870
myself with my skidding things we need

00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,570
more ideas to break it and make it

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,860
better so if you want to do this I guess

00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,730
I'm happy but if you want to do your

00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,590
ideas I'm even happier so possibly some

00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:24,070
people feel uncertain like I need more

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,960
examples I have more examples so we

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:30,180
built this whole demo

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,380
again with my colleague Belen goes from

00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:37,530
Spain in sunny Barcelona so this is

00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:41,430
about affordable like the iOS thing but

00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:45,660
in a browser so you have a fax this is

00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:48,180
the I call it a c64 the Commodore 64

00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:51,060
this is pixelated this is crazy as well

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,980
this one is this memo from before but

00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,780
what jealous because is like bigger you

00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:59,370
can use the whole screen without slowing

00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:01,590
down this one is creepy because I really

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,390
like the aesthetics of the jet of these

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,830
chase copes well we have the top here

00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,420
but I really like the aesthetics so I

00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,000
tried to make a shader that would look

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,650
this so this was like oh this looks

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,980
brilliant but you can actually look like

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,720
the J is comfy file so I kept removing

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,480
details and I think this looks pretty

00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:25,650
much like that so it's really played

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:28,350
with this and the cool thing is that you

00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:33,420
can actually pick up a clip so this is

00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:37,230
using I can record something and it just

00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:39,390
comes down that it's an analog on the

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,280
top so I don't if you consider but this

00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:44,520
is more programmers which is probably

00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,620
number and then you come down love it

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:50,280
you can get a block you can open with

00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:53,160
VLC because you know WebM um and

00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,200
whatever weapon thing is okay there we

00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:58,740
go so this is the thing I just recorded

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,850
let me close this we get to so yeah this

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,060
is nothing which is recording the

00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,950
browser because and I think seriously

00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,170
have you ever done anything like I saw

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,150
people trying to know what they were

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:11,310
doing they were trying to compile FFM

00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,140
breach into JavaScript using em

00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:15,000
scripting and transfer loading in chrome

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,400
and I traded with a very powerful

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,580
MacBook Pro and it just like started

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,620
taking off and it didn't work so if we

00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,270
come to me this is a really quickly

00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,190
underpowered computer and it doesn't

00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:29,220
even sweat it it's very very great that

00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:31,380
we can do this so this is very cool they

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,590
sorta that someone else built he

00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,360
is not using WebGL he's using a worker

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,580
web worker so he's doing all the

00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,760
processing on a cumbersome

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,310
web workers so what he does is if this

00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,280
is yeah so he's got this video of the

00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:48,290
Cookie Monster I just love him with a

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,420
green background and she's got some

00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,990
cookies here and obviously what's up the

00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:56,600
Cookie Monster like cookies so when I

00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,820
play here it's going to combine the two

00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,230
together and capture that in the video

00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:05,050
in which the Cookie Monster

00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:05,050
if got a very nice backdrop of cookies

00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,920
mmmmmm and they's got cook it in the

00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,840
background which is amazing and he's

00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,000
done nothing on the background with the

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,010
web worker so the UI is the responsive

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,840
and everything so that's cool things I

00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,360
don't even know this person I just found

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,030
this thing on the Internet

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,970
well it's my thing there we go so this

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:28,250
is very cold but they're always but and

00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,260
I was talking to Colin before like I am

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,780
very honest and something is broken I'm

00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:37,010
not going to tell you otherwise support

00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:38,750
is have to support everything to show

00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:42,020
you sometimes it crushes as you could

00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:44,030
see there were things going on but the

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,690
premise of this is touching many things

00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:50,240
like there's so many machineries

00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:54,650
underneath is kind of normal of things

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,110
break from 57 which happens to be canary

00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:59,330
if you're kind of it's late maybe maybe

00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:02,120
next week a small animal supports pretty

00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:04,670
much everything in current Princeton

00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,010
Vivaldi which he didn't support up until

00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:09,230
like two months ago but things break

00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:11,510
sometimes I filed the bottom some day I

00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,280
found I got the message so they fix up

00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,890
today which I'm very impressed hats off

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,990
I'm very impressed I was like a really

00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:23,530
bad but trash so it's good that they fix

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:23,530
that but yeah but their books for frying

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,620
intellect floor I will faint they will I

00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,140
think they're scared to touching the

00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,940
code of Internet Explorer but edge says

00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,020
that they were under consideration so

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,570
that's good I think also one of the

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:40,260
editors of the one of the specs is also

00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,850
from Microsoft I don't make sense in the

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,710
mobile phase mmm

00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:47,010
I don't think they is probably our exxor

00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,780
it's been calling yet and I've an idea

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,040
about Windows Phone library I saw one

00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,660
person with Windows Phone the other day

00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,710
I was going to ask like however you find

00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,890
it I thought it was a bit weird because

00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,510
I know this perfect I would not I would

00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:00,360
just refrain I'm so curious

00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,070
I don't think of reminiscent to support

00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,330
it you know they strip everything else I

00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,980
don't think they're going to do this I'm

00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:08,690
definitely not link-length

00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:12,510
for the struggle no it's a text browser

00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:14,460
so unless they use one of those text

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:20,880
liberators and I'm going to use this but

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:23,910
who knows little with Linux people shove

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,880
it well but like it's keeping great

00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:28,950
record like like last year this was a

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,800
landmine seriously whatever you did with

00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:34,740
crashes which is not work like videos

00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,210
would not look things would not record

00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,070
you have to tell it to break up with

00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:40,590
video and audio he just wanted to record

00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,630
maybe would work things with not workers

00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:45,210
oh there was no documentation but now

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,800
it's so much better so but we still need

00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,590
people to like you know find use cases

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,270
that we never thought of so you said

00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,770
break its trial box if you don't want

00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:55,920
the file box because you found the box a

00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:58,110
less scary just may not do my best

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,570
and you can't request features like some

00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:02,610
some some people ask me for things we

00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:05,040
can find it useful but when people ask

00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,420
things like I would like to provide my

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,860
own code that that makes sense because

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,780
maybe you have like very string

00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:14,910
compressed kind of encoder that is not

00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,440
really provided by the browser and maybe

00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:19,290
the students that they should let you

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,550
hook into your machinery so their

00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,800
figures like that which I have

00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,150
transferred to the miracles a group or I

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,650
can tell you where to go because they

00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,600
just give up so you can do it and I

00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,810
don't get to be the bottleneck so that's

00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:33,930
great and our positive phase like I

00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,430
brought this blog post which is pretty

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,190
much restored but in like a more

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:41,280
composed way

00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:43,710
there's also a lot of examples of my

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,260
colleague a me road like a lot of

00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,790
examples looking at every single thing

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,010
like how do you get come with a stream

00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,980
how do you use the medical sector thingy

00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,690
how they record the video so that it's

00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:58,350
got comments as well would you believe

00:36:54,690 --> 00:37:01,190
that and also no I didn't want to pick

00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:04,320
go back it's there but I don't see it

00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,820
there is the available there is also the

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,400
either communication that we finally

00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,110
have they get this immediate path but is

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,360
very interesting is put by the people

00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:14,310
that increment way back to thing so it's

00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,440
a way of checking that you're using the

00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:19,590
right syntax because syntax for cultural

00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,210
implementers I sometimes talk about

00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:24,720
these things well I still have a book

00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:27,390
and it's not a medium and the slides are

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,970
here as well I actually put them online

00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:32,760
this like all the beta version is online

00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:35,040
which I uploaded this morning and so if

00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,540
you go there you can use this this one

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,520
with a mobile phone because it's not the

00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,840
same for mobile and maybe just you know

00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,750
they might not even work with Chrome

00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,760
because you know depends of the version

00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:49,140
but I will say this don't worry

00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,170
and thanks and that's it actually I can

00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:55,110
gonna

00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:55,110
