Title: Petra Gulicher: Building a style guide for all Australians
Publication date: 2017-05-19
Playlist: CSSConf AU 2016
Description: 
	Thank you to Mozilla for making video recording possible.

It’s not often you get to build The Nation’s Bootstrap.

It’s easy to see what goes wrong when you build out thousands of websites without a style guide. There are over 2,200 Australian Government websites and they all have their own… character.

But what if someone gave you the job of fixing it? How would you even start? What is a style guide anyway? Does it include coding standards or just CSS? BEM or Atomic CSS? Does everything have to work in IE8? What about screen readers? And what about doing it completely in the open, when everyone’s watching intently?

Somebody gave me that job - along with a crack team of designers, developers, content writers and user researchers. In less than 3 months we put a working CSS framework and design guide in the hands of real humans building real sites.

This is how we did it.

hello everybody first of all you're all

00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:16,010
a bunch of champs thank you for sticking

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:19,010
it out today and I'm glad that I can be

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,350
here for the final talk of today I'd

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,690
like to share some lessons that I learnt

00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,570
and shared with the team working on the

00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:30,920
design guide project at the dta VTO you

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:34,940
might know it is so let's get going I'm

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:39,320
patch I am a product engineer and I work

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,789
for a design studio called us to product

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,800
engineer means that I helped build

00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:45,109
product and the systems that deliver the

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:51,190
product and I do that on the web because

00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:54,230
I like it I'm from Sydney in Australia

00:00:51,190 --> 00:01:01,219
which is not far from here Melbourne is

00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:03,800
nice too I guess up to we call ourselves

00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:06,920
a digital product studio which means

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,710
that we launched products services even

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,030
our own companies we've got four studios

00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,740
around the world and Sydney's the

00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,530
smallest to the youngest with a baby

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,770
we've only got about 30 people but we've

00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,280
worked with already brands and we'd

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,689
start ups and now with the government

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,500
launching products that have some kind

00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:30,350
of impact on the world you might know us

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,409
to buy this game Monument Valley it came

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:37,009
out about two ish years ago and it's

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:39,799
been downloaded about 26 million times

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:42,500
which is once for every man woman and

00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:47,210
child in Australia and a few dogs as

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:50,810
well so I started working with the dta

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:53,960
about six months ago on their digital

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:57,530
style guide project the dta was

00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,149
established in 2015 as Mel said to help

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,179
government departments and agencies

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:04,729
transform their services to make them

00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:06,560
work better more gooder they've got

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:10,429
teams in Canberra and in Sydney and

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,900
they've grown to about 100 people maybe

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,379
a lot of people a lot of people doing

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,390
really great work government services

00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:19,310
they work on stuff like

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,650
if you need to book an appointment with

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,930
the Department of Immigration that

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,610
sounds like a simple thing to do the dta

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,200
works with the department to make sure

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,600
that that online service is as simple

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,500
and as clear as it can be they've also

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,180
worked on attendance records for child

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,920
care services with the department of

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,760
education and training stuff that

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:44,270
touches people's lives on the Reg makes

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,670
a big difference if they work better so

00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,950
we've got this handy 13-point guide

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,610
which helps us deliver simpler clearer

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,860
and faster digital services there's a

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,660
lot of words up there and it's a

00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,769
wonderful guide to follow while you're

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:09,760
delivering project but what it boils

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:13,430
down to is follow a guide so we made one

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,000
because the dto has a philosophy that

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,489
says deliver quickly learn and then

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,930
iterate delivering quickly means that

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:23,060
you want to have as little waist as

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,930
possible in every project and so that's

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,000
where a style guide can help our team

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:33,079
formed to build a CSS framework and

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,970
piece of documentation to help to help

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,250
teams at the dto get up and running as

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,790
quickly as possible of my projects so

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,590
this is what we came up with it's a

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,049
screen reader ready it doesn't look very

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:49,370
glamorous but it it's quite small and

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:53,090
it's fully fully mechag compliant and it

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:56,690
works like almost everywhere which is

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,840
hard work but why build a style guide in

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,310
the first place I don't think that all

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,810
of the government websites should look

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,390
the same because that would be a bit

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,980
boring and I'm not going to try and sell

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,810
you on the value of building a style

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,140
guide because a lot has been said about

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,440
why that's probably a good idea but what

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,410
I will talk about it why making a style

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,600
guide helps us deliver simpler clearer

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,890
and faster digital services for

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,410
government government is really

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,390
complicated it's a complicated machine

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,400
it's big the australian federal

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,990
government

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,580
as a teen departments and 192 agencies

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,530
resulting in thousands and thousands of

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,509
websites so you can imagine there's a

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,750
lot of redundancy in the way that things

00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:45,940
are built and a lot of overhead both for

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,699
citizens that have to interface with

00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,020
government agencies and of course for

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,870
the departments that are maintaining

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,430
these websites simply bringing things

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,930
online doesn't necessarily make them

00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:02,020
more efficient government is for

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,100
everyone that's why government exists so

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,780
when you're building an online

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,430
government service you have an audience

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:11,139
size of everybody so that it kind of

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,080
you've got to make sure it works for

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:19,180
everyone everywhere which is a bit of a

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:21,039
challenge go back there we go case study

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,650
in device support so it's like

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,000
responsive is not anything anymore we do

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,789
it pretty well we know about

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,979
connectivity problems even though a lot

00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:33,460
of us sit on a laptop or a nice big

00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:35,139
screen things look real nice we're aware

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,360
of all of the other devices that people

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,620
use to access the internet and of course

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,710
that means represented with

00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,960
accessibility problems or opportunities

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,580
shall I say people have different levels

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,050
of connectivity they've got different

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,599
types of attention when they're

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,690
interfacing with your online service so

00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,830
we can be real good development we can

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,050
make sure that we've got all these use

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,729
cases covered off but what about when

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,900
someone looks at your website with a

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:04,349
Nintendo Wii because that happens 5000

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,169
sessions on the ATO website last year

00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:12,060
fire and infant oh week

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,650
so cool good on that and of course that

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,270
doesn't mean that you were now just

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,340
building websites for the Nintendo Wii

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,740
because that would be a bit weird but

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,050
it's a nice reminder that sometimes

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,849
people are using devices that you

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,310
wouldn't expect and it's not always that

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:28,650
of choice two people have older Android

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,469
devices that may be currently upgraded

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,900
and if something works on the wii it's

00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:36,090
probably going to work on any new device

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,300
that comes out to so you've really got

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,680
to broaden your scope of thinking and

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,129
think about the user not about the

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,379
device so i'm going to talk about some

00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:48,930
do's and don'ts the the design guide

00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:52,259
project I was working on it for about

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:55,349
six months and we went from we probably

00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,389
needed design guide to working software

00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,789
over that period of time but of course

00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,199
it was it had its unique challenges and

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:04,529
we went some lessons so I'm going to try

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,319
and share some of them with you number

00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:09,300
one don't work in a bubble and I'm a one

00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,060
thing that I took away from working on

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,210
this project was that design systems

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,849
take a lot of people to build and even

00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,250
though our team had research capability

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:22,319
design capability development we were in

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,740
no position at all to tell the whole of

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,449
the organization how and in you know

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,580
what style they should build their

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,409
interfaces what we needed to do is

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,089
constantly be in touch with all of the

00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,439
other teams find out what they were

00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:37,259
building what worked for them and what

00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,629
didn't and and make sure that we were

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,939
friendly and happy and try and be a bit

00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,379
funny in the change locks and make sure

00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:47,729
that people always feel happy to come to

00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:50,490
you you've got to be flexible like we

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:52,979
had a remote team the entire time so we

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,889
did most of our hangouts on flac and we

00:07:52,979 --> 00:08:00,050
would just work wherever we could find a

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:05,509
Wi-Fi so don't work in a bubble

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:09,569
collaborate do test early and test often

00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:11,969
that's my life motto I've got a picture

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:14,159
up here of our very early work shopping

00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:16,169
session where we defined the MVP of what

00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:17,490
this design guide would look like and so

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,390
that's given that that was our first

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,280
deliverable what we initially had to do

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,410
was define what that product would look

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,060
like what's in it who are the people

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,800
that are going to use it and what do we

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,500
think we know about what they need to

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,080
get out of our product so by the time we

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,840
made our first release a couple of weeks

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,490
in we already have something ready to

00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,050
test with a set of hypotheses and

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,260
challenge our assumptions about the

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,330
product as an example we we assumed that

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,460
the best model to deliver a CSS

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,470
framework with a little snippet of CSS a

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,350
little snippet of markup bit of

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,120
information about how to do it right

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,710
turns out a lot of the developers don't

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,200
have control over the mark-up that

00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,730
they're putting into screens maybe the

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,400
mark-up is coming from another back-end

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:04,040
system how do we accommodate that we've

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,050
got the tool from this month to do it of

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,310
course we were not just testing with

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,540
users but we were testing the code

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:13,010
itself so we always made sure that some

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,080
that we had any automated tests we

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,140
possibly could for accessibility would

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,670
check on things like our file size

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:24,470
you'll notice that I haven't actually

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:27,710
talked about any CSS yet but now now we

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:32,360
do the extend thing or don't as the case

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:34,550
may be result of some of our testing

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,500
turns out we've ended up with a real big

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,980
stylesheet smell so great for

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,200
performance just bad idea generally we

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,800
found out that extends was not working

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,360
in our favor decide not to use it and

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,800
that's okay that's the decision that we

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,020
made as a team and that's a lesson that

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,310
we learnt but because we had these tests

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,660
in place we were able to figure out

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,000
really quickly that something was going

00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,860
wrong fix it and get on with our lives

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,900
of course that started to raise

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,410
questions about our architecture to do

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:06,400
we need conventions to stop us from

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:08,690
implementing anti-patterns maybe

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,010
architecture as you go if when we

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,750
started out we didn't know what the

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,730
design system would look like we were

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,610
developing a design system and also

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,350
coning a framework to deliver it so what

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,930
that meant was we have to decide one

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,460
piece at a time what the what the

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,040
structure would be and so the first

00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,690
piece was typography you know what is a

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,630
heading look like what fonts are we

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,730
using one's our line spacing and so on

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,870
and so forth and as each time we added a

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,580
new piece we say well how does it

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,860
have fit and how does it change the

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,750
things that we've already got in place

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,900
so it's nice and lean we had enough

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,250
structure to inform the rest of the

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,540
teams but nothing that would ever

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:51,779
constrain us the key was flexibility so

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,700
you can see we started out with just a

00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,860
partial for a whole bunch of things that

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,450
you might find on a page and then as we

00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,910
go on we started to get a little bit

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,529
more serious about well maybe this is a

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,390
component and this is a utility of

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,730
course that means that we can manage the

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,500
dependencies within our imports a lot

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,900
more easily but we only added that

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:16,710
complexity as it was required everything

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,360
that you produce at the dta is open

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,940
source because it's a really nice way to

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,980
work having you proud out in the open

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,020
and I know what an open source project

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,540
is I think that means that you've got an

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,339
open repo means you've got contributing

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,589
guidelines you've got a really nice read

00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:35,010
me probably got some templates and you

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:37,350
pull requests and issues so that was all

00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,240
going great until we realized that we

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,610
actually didn't have the time all the

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,950
capabilities to deal with feature

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,320
requests that came in so even though we

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,480
were deciding for weeks on end but I oh

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,950
it's okay if another team develops a

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,440
feature they test it and they bring it

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:55,320
back to us we'll just swap that right

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,050
back in unfortunately we had a crisis of

00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,820
confidence we didn't know is this the

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,529
button that we want for everyone we have

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,209
to define our own product and our own

00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:06,170
roadmap before we knew what we could

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:08,910
fold back in so I think the effort of

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:11,120
implementing a community or rather

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,260
managing a community of open source

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,730
contributors means that you have to have

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,140
a really really strong belief in what

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:20,880
you're building and where you want it to

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:23,070
go unfortunately we we ended up with

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,779
pull request so we just sit open for

00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,230
weeks and weeks and eventually month

00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:30,029
which is horrific because we couldn't

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,980
have the confidence in our own product

00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:34,290
to make a call on whether this thing

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:39,630
should be in or out maybe someone should

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:43,440
have just merged it on an alley this

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:46,410
morning she said that having good markup

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,250
means that your page your document has

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,430
meaning

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,810
without any styles at all and that was a

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,480
philosophy that we followed on this

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:58,500
project from the very beginning so when

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:02,520
we came to look at things in in RI e 7 &

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,220
a 6 because it's government and people

00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,250
still use IE 6 297 actually no I think

00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,890
we ruled out IE 6 yeah I think we did

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,680
but I 7 still there still a lot of that

00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:16,110
and the best the best way that we could

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,030
deliver quick value to those older

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,460
browsers was just by ripping out the

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,740
stylesheets completely and because we

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,840
had a well structured document every

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,200
component that we added to this style

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:34,440
guide had guidance on which which chef

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:37,350
what they called you tags elements HTML

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,270
how does it work I don't know we gave

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,950
guidance about what the semantic meaning

00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:44,280
of each of those elements are do you

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,440
have to apply a role to it or any extra

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:50,400
attributes to give it more meaning yes

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,110
or no of course no style sheet is not

00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,880
really a solution that's going to cut it

00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:58,560
because the internet would just look

00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:01,560
like 1998 if it did so once we once we

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,480
focused our efforts on producing style

00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,430
has enhancement instead of working on

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,310
fall back we found that we could provide

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,680
a better experience for less capable

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:16,050
browsers and also give all of the sugar

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:19,080
two new ones so how did we do it it's a

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:25,290
real mind filled out there and now we

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:29,570
get to write the actual code code

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:32,370
comments plus gulp is the style guide

00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,440
basically because we wanted to deliver

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,120
the first iteration of this style guide

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,880
so quickly and we wanted it to be a

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,050
living style guide we said all right we

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,730
don't want to be developing through

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,830
products we don't want to develop a CSS

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,910
framework over here and then develop a

00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:50,040
guide over here let's join them and so

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,860
did a bit of googling found this thing

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,870
called KSS which is a syntax for CSF

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,880
comments and then thanks to a nifty

00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,450
little node generator that runs on a

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,700
gulp task we take all of this

00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,770
comments out of our CSS and build them

00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,680
into a static site which was real cool

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:11,440
so the comments will have terrible

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:14,780
contrast probably not double a compliant

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,220
so here our buttons partial that we use

00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:21,110
South by the way because it's pre handy

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,970
in our buttons partial above all of the

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,310
styles that describe what appointment

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,700
should look like we have a comment block

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:31,100
and it says creating buttons we've got

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,860
some markdown content there we've got a

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,370
link to an HTML another path to an HTML

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,740
file that that contains the markup that

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,330
matches these styles and then we say

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,750
we're in the style guide does it live

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:47,990
losing the button section and once we

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:51,290
pass it through the sausage machine we

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,030
get a page on the style guide called

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,160
button there's a section they're called

00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,380
creating buttons and then all of our

00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,450
content is there all of the different

00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,990
types of buttons you can have its really

00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:04,880
a while and then and then your markup

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,720
sample there and there's a link back to

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,740
github so that you can raise an issue

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,260
dig through the code or whatever you

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,810
fancy so that got us up and running

00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,970
really really quickly and it meant that

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,060
any time we were editing styles we were

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,460
editing the documentation and therefore

00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,290
updating the guide and if the project

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,920
went on we found that that had its

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:30,200
limitations because we couldn't just

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,840
make a page like you would expect to be

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,120
able to do on a website so when it came

00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,760
time when swapped out our node kff

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,320
builder for a jekyll build so we have

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,320
the same principle we took all of those

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,300
comments out of our CSS into a data

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,120
object put them through a difference

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,190
office machine and spat out a jekyll

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,570
static site at the end same principle

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:55,700
worked really well this is the the

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,590
digital marketplace website which was

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:02,000
one of the first adopters of the digital

00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:05,449
star guide they went from zero to be de

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,430
in two months less than three months for

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:11,370
show and they were they were really key

00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,770
this team

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,750
in bringing new features back into the

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:19,770
UI kit and also helping us test out the

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,510
features that we've put in so what we

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,670
ended up with was a tool that helped

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,660
teams at the dta deliver a really really

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,520
quick prototype instead of having to

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,640
design test a new login pattern every

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,110
time you launch a new project you can go

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,400
to the divine guidance say what does the

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,830
login screen look like the marketplace

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,720
and other projects were able to launch

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,340
incredibly quickly and not have to worry

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,900
about Deborah alpha testing or their

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,320
accessibility testing they knew that

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,570
they had a baseline of support I'm a new

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,910
dto website which was just launched last

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,360
week there was a name change getting new

00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,860
website that was built in just two weeks

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,170
it was transitioned over to the new

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:05,610
styles that we had in the in the guide
