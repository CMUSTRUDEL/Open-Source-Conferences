	Thank you to Mozilla for making video recording possible.

In data visualization for the web, SVG is really only used to create shapes; circles, rectangles, lines. But SVG can do much more that be "just" a shape. In this talk, I'd like to show you how to experiment with SVG gradients and filters to make data visualizations even more fun and engaging. Featuring interactive slides and a lot of data visualization eye candy I want to demonstrate how to implement the techniques with JS, CSS. From rainbow, moving and dynamic SVG gradients based on data, to SVG filters with which to create glow, gooey, and fuzzy effects that brighten up any visual.
