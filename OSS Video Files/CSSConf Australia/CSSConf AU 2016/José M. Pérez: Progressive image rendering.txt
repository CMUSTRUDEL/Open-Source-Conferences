On a regular web page, images represent the largest assets. We might have heard about responsive images to serve the most suitable image for each screen. However, how we load them and when we do can have a great impact too.

Several months ago we decided at Spotify that we wanted to overhaul the design and performance of our most trafficked website. Changing how and when images were loaded turned out to have a large effect.

I'd love to come tell you about the use of placeholders, dominant colours, blurry images and lazy load to improve the perceived performance of websites. These techniques leverage several web technologies like CSS3, canvas and the recent IntersectionObserver JS API.
