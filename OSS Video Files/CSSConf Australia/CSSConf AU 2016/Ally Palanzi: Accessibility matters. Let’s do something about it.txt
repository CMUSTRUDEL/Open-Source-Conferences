Title: Ally Palanzi: Accessibility matters. Let’s do something about it
Publication date: 2017-05-19
Playlist: CSSConf AU 2016
Description: 
	Thank you to Mozilla for making video recording possible.

Making work accessible creates a better experience across the board. As creators, it is our responsibility to make sure that everyone–regardless of ability, situation, or context–can access it.

At Vox Media, quick growth and fast deadlines never allowed accessibility to be considered. We have many advocates for accessibility throughout the company, but originally, we didn’t have a company-wide structure in place to implement standards across the board. Earlier this year we decided to change that. Six team members gathered for two days to figure out just how to approach accessibility on a company-wide scale. Over the course of two days, we documented role-specific best practices and how each team member could implement them into their actual work. Later, we shared what we learned with the company and open sourced a checklist for anyone to use.

This talk will dive into accessibility best-practices, why it is important, and how we're making a cultural shift to focus on it at Vox Media.

okay yeah so just as the title says I'm

00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,790
here to talk to you all about

00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:14,440
accessibility why it's super important

00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,630
how we're dealing with it where I work

00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,100
at Vox media and I'm also gonna leave

00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,820
you with some tips so hopefully you can

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,800
start implementing it in your work and

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,929
like he's said on a leap Lindsey your

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,539
second Ally of the day and I'm a

00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:32,200
front-end engineer at Vox media working

00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:33,760
on our platform and that's my twitter if

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,060
you want to follow me I post a lot of

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,440
pictures of my cat and then also if you

00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,829
need to follow along with the slides at

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,960
all you can see it at this link so how

00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:47,530
many of you currently include

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,079
accessibility in your workflow okay

00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:54,160
that's awesome so hopefully a lot of you

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:57,730
are familiar so accessibility or a 11y

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,460
or ally or ally if you want reference to

00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,140
the design of products devices services

00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,130
or environments for people who

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,930
experience disabilities in 2001 the

00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,270
World Health Organization redefined

00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,240
disability as a mismatch and interaction

00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:16,750
between the features of a person's body

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,780
with the features in which of the

00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,400
environment in which they live as

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,860
designers and developers and people who

00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,240
make stuff our work can create or remove

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,920
these mismatches in interaction we're in

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,840
like a really cool place working on the

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,160
web because the impact of disability is

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,870
radically changed

00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,520
the web removes barriers to

00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,770
communication and interaction that many

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,300
people face in the physical world it's a

00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,850
really cool place for us to be in and we

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:46,150
can really help people this way just

00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,310
like the last presentation and by

00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,890
designing with disabilities in mind we

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,450
create better products for everyone it's

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,740
really important to not think of

00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,980
disability as something that only

00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,450
affects a subset of users it's not

00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,700
something you can really tell from your

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,520
analytics you can't see who's using a

00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,500
screen reader there's really not a great

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,120
way to see if users are tabbing through

00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,039
your web site and only using keyboard

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,989
navigation so it's really important to

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,870
think about everyone and thinking about

00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:16,240
including this all the time and to not

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,820
just think of disability as

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,400
something that affects people

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,160
permanently disability can affect anyone

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,290
at some point in their life

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,080
Microsoft design built out extensive and

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,790
really fascinating guidelines on

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,620
inclusive design in it they show the

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,720
different states of accessibility area

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,040
of disability and it can really be all

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,560
over the place so we need to plan for

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,480
that disability can be permanent it can

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,270
be temporary

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,710
situational a user who might be using

00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,260
your website within the house one

00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,880
morning could have a baby in their arms

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,920
later that night and might only be able

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,950
to interact with it via the keyboard so

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,570
that's kind of a situational disability

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,510
as opposed to somebody who might have a

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,490
broken arm

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,290
so I get it it can be really hard to

00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,990
advocate for accessibility in your

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,480
workplace and build in the extra time to

00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,900
make sure it's important but you've

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,710
really just got to trust the facts

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,720
analytics aren't going to show you that

00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,210
you're doing better but it'll be better

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,160
overall for your users and it's just

00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:22,300
it's better for business building

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,790
accessible products will improve a lot

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,980
of things and a lot of thinking about

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,450
accessibility feeds into other web best

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,000
practices that you are probably familiar

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,500
with like device independence things

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,270
should work across different browsers

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,500
they should work across different

00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:40,090
devices your product should be usable

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,300
should be usable for all types of users

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,950
older users who may not be tech savvy or

00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,890
even people in other countries who might

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,010
not be as tech savvy as we are and then

00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,650
of course a word that all executives and

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,080
clients like to hear SEO if a screen

00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,070
reader can access your site properly so

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,380
can Google's indexing and case studies

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,600
show that accessible web sites are just

00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,160
better overall they have better search

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,620
results they have reduced maintenance

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:14,260
over time and increased audience reach

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,880
an accessibility support social

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,230
inclusion allowing us to hire more

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,950
diversely and reach a diverse audience

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:25,720
and then there's of course scary legal

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:28,270
things so companies like Netflix sweet

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,110
green have experienced lawsuits for

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,540
having accessible

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,340
the issues things like creating internal

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,560
tools that employees are required to use

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,330
to get their job done if an accessible

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,670
might mean that you can't hire as they

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,440
firstly as you should or it might mean

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,630
your disadvantaging disabled employees

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,490
to do their job this is really important

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,860
for us at Vox media because we create

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,540
tools for our reporters to publish

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,210
content and get news out into the world

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,930
and if we can't hire diverse ly then we

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,700
don't get those diverse voices in many

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,980
countries are recognizing and acting

00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,530
upon the need to ensure access to the

00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:05,170
web for people with disabilities the

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,910
common approach throughout the world is

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,610
to adopt the web content accessibility

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,760
guidelines which is developed through

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,860
the w3c process and explains how to make

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,030
content more accessible to people with

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:21,250
disabilities in the u.s. we have

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,580
something called section 508 of the

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,650
Rehabilitation Act so basically it's a

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,710
mandate for government agencies and

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,390
federally funded nonprofit colleges

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,430
schools that they need to pass a certain

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:38,440
level of accessibility or they can get

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:41,200
sued they can lose funding bad stuff and

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,930
in Australia the world wide web access

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,170
Disability Discrimination Act advisory

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,490
you know it's just a lot of words

00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,930
requires equal access for people with

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,600
disabilities where it can be reasonably

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,640
reasonably be provided which is similar

00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,800
to the u.s. 508 compliance and that

00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,310
mandates like governments and banks and

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,590
education sites to be accessible in for

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,110
the European Union the EU Charter of

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,790
Fundamental Rights article 21 prohibits

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,700
discrimination based on the grounds of

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,860
diverse their disability among others so

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,460
if your site isn't accessible it can be

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,870
seen as discrimination and then more

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,730
obviously I wasn't going to go through

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,770
all of different countries everything is

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,930
slightly different so it's really

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,550
important to be aware of the

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,670
accessibility laws that pertain to your

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,530
work and if this somehow still doesn't

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:32,590
convince your project stakeholders or

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,330
project managers just do it ask for

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,200
forgiveness later it's really not that

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,660
complicated

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,920
to build accessibility in and no one is

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,300
going to be mad at you for making your

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,300
products more accessible hopefully

00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:47,630
so like I said there's a lot of reasons

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,520
to care about accessibility and that box

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,440
we've grown a lot over the past few

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,960
years I think when I started the product

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,570
team was about 40 people now we're up to

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,570
150 and the whole company is probably

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,450
close to a thousand so we're building

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,830
lots and lots of things for our

00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,820
colleagues and our users and it's not

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,850
really something we've ever really

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:12,350
started to consider we didn't really

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:14,030
start until earlier this year in May but

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,210
we're already seeing big changes across

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,400
the company on the product team we've

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,530
always had advocates for accessibility

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,240
one of my co-workers created an

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,540
accessibility channel in slack which is

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,010
how you know it's official

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:32,330
so it was just kind of like a group of

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:34,490
maybe 10 of us who would drop in links

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,490
and share knowledge and it didn't really

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,180
go much past that for I guess this was

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:44,060
greater than 2015 so for over a year and

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,800
we talked a lot in there to try to

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,169
figure out how we could start including

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,510
accessibility into our workflow and at

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,570
Vox we have this yearly hackathon where

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,340
the product team gets together we're

00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,620
very remote so we come into one place

00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,700
and we have a hackathon where we can

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,460
work on whatever we want it's called

00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,960
Beck's Vox hacks and we can work on

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,510
anything I think somebody made an app

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,640
this year that sends you gifts of

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,130
puppies every day so it can really be

00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,020
very broad and this is really successful

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,520
so we also have this thing we called

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,530
mini-vac PSA's which is we're like a

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,180
small group of people get together and

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,430
can just kind of work on whatever they

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,770
want our managers are pretty lenient

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,389
about approving whatever not whatever

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:28,610
but reasonably so I think six of us

00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:31,850
decided that we wanted to do like a mini

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,110
hackathon to kind of scope out and

00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,729
figure out how we could all start

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,110
including accessibility into our

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,459
workflows so we spent two days

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,950
realistically we all couldn't take two

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:44,480
too much time away from work to think

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,600
about this we kind of wanted to time box

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,860
it and we knew we wanted to get some

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,040
sort of training so we

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:57,460
asks someone from this agency in DC

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,960
called bigot and one of their friend

00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,980
engineers came up to our office for a

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,870
day talked about all things

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,010
accessibility which was really really

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,530
helpful to see how they were

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,660
incrementing or including it into their

00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,880
process so we spent two days

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,740
brainstorming we had a speaker we were a

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,710
whole bunch of documentation and then we

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,780
spent a lot of time planning how we

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,530
would start spreading this across the

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,870
company so this is a screenshot of our

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,930
Google Docs folder just for like our

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,270
final documents we wrote a lot of Docs I

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,880
think they're six and we kind of broke

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:32,440
it up based on role so we have a

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,270
document for engineers we have a

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,800
document for project managers we have a

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:39,400
document for quality assurance

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,200
designers editorial to make it a little

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,280
bit easier to spread it across the team

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,080
and that way we wouldn't just like

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,370
overload people with a whole bunch of

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,490
documentation that would be really

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,320
difficult for them to parse and then

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,450
with all that we also kind of came up

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,040
with some guiding principles help us

00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,540
frame like why we care about

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,030
accessibility and why this is really

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,710
important to us to consider and think

00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,540
about

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,160
so first one is people want to access

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,680
our content and use our tools let's make

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,420
it easy for them we don't make

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,860
assumptions about our users as I

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,150
mentioned before it's really difficult

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,480
to tell what disabilities may be

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,950
affecting your users this is where the

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,090
industry is going get on board or get

00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:21,340
left behind and then accessibility is

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,780
everyone's responsibility this is

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,340
important because we didn't want the six

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,010
of us to just become like the

00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,810
accessibility police we wanted to ensure

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,970
that everybody understood the importance

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,960
and wouldn't just expect us to call them

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:37,080
out we wanted everyone to really care so

00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,730
this turned out to be really successful

00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,700
we spread them around to our team people

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,790
read them people love them we wrote best

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,070
practices for editorial on our internal

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,210
documentation website that we have we're

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,860
and knowledge shares and gave

00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,650
presentations to any team that would

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,180
listen to us and we shared it on our

00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:58,420
blogs that other companies could use it

00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,920
if they wanted and we began to

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,680
incorporate it into every single project

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,939
so this screenshot is an example of the

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,319
verge redesign

00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:08,439
was happening earlier this year and the

00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:10,299
team that worked on that laid this out

00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:13,739
early on like when thinking and picking

00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:16,209
about brand colors and things like that

00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:17,589
and then probably the hardest part is

00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,779
trying to figure out how to keep people

00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:22,089
accountable so one of the main things we

00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:25,179
came up with when we had that little

00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:27,220
hackathon was to start integrating our

00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:29,709
access for accessibility into our

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,720
quality assurance process so we met with

00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:33,849
our QA managers and our support managers

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,819
and talked to them about how we could

00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:38,409
like start testing for this stuff we

00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:40,899
started treating it as other features in

00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:42,639
a project so just as your requirements

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,519
checklist we added accessibility stuff

00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,089
in there too and then celebrating wins

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:52,149
so for the example for the verge

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:53,709
redesign which launched in March we like

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,299
called out like this was designed

00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,309
through a lens of accessibility and this

00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:01,289
was like really thoughtful and important

00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:03,339
to us so since we had all these internal

00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:04,569
successes we wanted to figure out how we

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:09,189
could share this with the world and

00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:11,169
figure out like how we could get other

00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:12,759
like open source contributions from

00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:14,499
other people and like we figured that

00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:18,639
this was really useful for us that could

00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:21,459
be useful for everyone else so luckily

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,279
for us we had that hackathon which is

00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:27,279
every summer so it was just a few months

00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,139
after this was in July so we spent two

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,309
days fleshing out the guidelines and

00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:32,139
kind of figuring out how we wanted to

00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:33,729
share it at first we were just going to

00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:35,949
release all the documentation in some

00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:37,269
small open source website but then we

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:39,609
started to try to think of like how we

00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:42,879
use the documents and like what the best

00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:49,119
vehicle for that is so he created this

00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:52,839
site accessibility box mediacom oh yeah

00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:55,509
this is a gif of the site kind of so one

00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,449
of my teammates had started including

00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:01,299
accessibility checklists in each of her

00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:03,220
projects so she would list out like what

00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:05,169
the engineer would have to do and would

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,789
add accessibility things for them to

00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:09,909
think about to that and things like for

00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:12,729
the QA people like and add accessibility

00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:14,709
into that so because we thought she was

00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:16,959
using these docs we thought that making

00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:18,310
a checklist builder would be helpful for

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,499
other people

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,939
so we have the site divided up into the

00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,279
same sections that we created for the

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:27,939
documentation designers engineers

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,949
project managers QA editorial and it

00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:31,480
allows you to select the items relevant

00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:33,910
to your project now it puts a list for

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,420
you to copy it also includes a bunch of

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:39,759
links to resources and tools and this

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,069
was like people liked it and I think

00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,899
people use it I hope people use it we

00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:49,149
got a bunch of open source contributions

00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:51,189
and it's been really helpful for us so

00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:53,649
that's pretty much the story of how we

00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:55,089
got it like started at Vox media and now

00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,470
I'm gonna hopefully give you all some

00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:59,019
practical advice that you can start

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:03,610
using so accessibility best practices

00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:05,439
for designers and developers this is

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,970
important one make sure there's enough

00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:07,600
contrast between the text and its

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,370
background color

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,160
there's tons of tools to help figure

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:15,970
this out you don't have to just guess

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,860
and there's standards for it don't

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,079
indicate important information using

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,050
color alone so this example is if you

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,170
had a link in text and you've just had

00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:27,430
the link a different color not our low

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,139
vision users or people with

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,759
colorblindness won't even notice so

00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,769
that's a link so adding something like

00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:37,149
an underline or maybe bolding it would

00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:41,500
help with that pairing values of color

00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:42,639
not just hues to increase contrast it's

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,110
always good to look at your stuff in

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,639
black and white occasionally just to

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:49,240
kind of see there's also tools for

00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,160
colorblind simulation designing

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,670
accessible forms this was kind of

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,279
brought up in Ali's talk also making

00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,050
labels very clear having error messages

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,779
that are very clear not just using color

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,220
very confusing and frustrating when you

00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:06,069
fill out a form and get an error but

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,350
don't know why and then from that just

00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:11,589
building accessible forms always have

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:13,240
labels for every input don't use

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,850
placeholder text instead of a label

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,459
labels shouldn't disappear on form focus

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,379
and then make sure to use field set and

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,499
legend for larger forms it's helpful for

00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:26,740
if users are using a screen reader and

00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:29,379
other assistive technology then use

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,830
semantic HTML luckily for us HTML is

00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,590
semantics by default

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:36,260
have to go out of your way to mess it up

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:38,240
try not to nest unnecessarily elements

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,650
like div inside a div inside a div

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,150
inside of divs like sometimes it's

00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,460
necessary but it makes it a little bit

00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:47,390
more difficult for assistive tech to

00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:49,460
like parse the information use headings

00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:53,090
each one three eight six four content

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:56,960
structure avoid skipping headings in the

00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:58,850
same sections and then it's okay to have

00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,580
multiple of the same heading on a page

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:05,180
just it's better to not have to H ones

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,800
and like your first section I think it

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,510
used to be an SEO thing to not have

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,120
multiple like more than one h1 on a page

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:15,400
but I don't think that holds true today

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:17,600
and HTML landmarks so these help define

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,520
specific areas that a user might want to

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,230
seek out and can save them a bunch of

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,550
time so for example if you're using a

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,340
screen reader and need to skip to the

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:28,340
navigation this helps with that the

00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,320
html5 elements like header main nav

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,880
footer aside I'll have these built in

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,050
but if you're not using this you can add

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:39,800
role banner role navigation etc to add

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,540
that in this is it pretty simple and

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,130
your document should have a language

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,600
attribute this is good for SEO and

00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:50,030
screen readers just to know what

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:52,550
language your pages in focus States so

00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,440
you should absolutely never remove focus

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:58,040
States from any of your buttons or links

00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,440
I think the original CSS reset from Eric

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,090
Meyer like the first one had this set to

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,380
none and so people just never over wrote

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:09,199
it it's since been updated and then if

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,370
you don't like the or like normal blue

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,380
you can kind of see it up there focus

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,660
color you can design better ones or you

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,980
can just leave them as is and then they

00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,050
should never be subtle they should stand

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,610
out users should be able to tell what

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,410
item their tab to and what they're

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,320
focused on this is oh you can't even

00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:30,380
really see it there but so on Google for

00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,390
some reason their search field doesn't

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,340
have that blue focus state it just

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,990
darkens the drop shadow a little bit and

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,110
this is a great example of like that's

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,890
not noticeable at all and they really

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,770
should have just left that blue glow

00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,910
knowing when to use buttons firstly

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,980
linking to something outside the page

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,660
you should use an anchor tag if you are

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,950
performing an action on the page like

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,050
submitting a form you should use a

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,320
button these are used differently with

00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:00,080
keyboards and knob screen readers and

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,630
then making links descriptive if you

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,600
just have a link that says click here it

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,010
is difficult for if the screen reader

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,830
pulls out all the links on a page

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:12,080
outside of the context of the text click

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,580
here does not make any sense it's also

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,580
really helpful for SEO to have

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:21,800
descriptive content connected to the

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:25,420
link should write good alt text for

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:29,990
images and high decorative images and

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:31,580
not have bad all sense so this is for

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,320
this is helpful for if your image

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,170
doesn't load this text is what will show

00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,610
up in its place this is how non sighted

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,620
users will get descriptions of your

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,080
images and then if you have decorative

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,260
images like a boarder for example you

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,720
can add an attribute Aria hidden true

00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:51,140
and that'll just hide that from people

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,690
with assistive technology then

00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,750
accessible inline SVG so svgs are used

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,280
as icons interactive elements they

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,470
should have a title or description and

00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,670
then you can use Aria labeled by

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,250
attributes to tell the screen reader

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,710
what element to use to describe the SVG

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:10,010
so this example of a green rectangle

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,560
probably not the most useful SVG but it

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,880
is labeled by the title so if a user is

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,260
using a screen reader this is what

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,090
that's what they'll hear and if an

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,120
experience can't be made accessible then

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,590
create another route for assistive tech

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,350
not everything is easily made accessible

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,090
so if you have like a really complicated

00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,340
interactive chart or graph something

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,980
like that it might be better to have

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,740
like an HTML table displaying that data

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,330
but just hidden on the page but in the

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,160
markup still so that screen readers will

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,860
still access it as long as you don't

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,790
display none on it a screen reader will

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,500
still pick it up allowing for viewport

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:51,380
zooming so a lot of people add this to

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,180
their site so you can't zoom in or on

00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,830
your iPhone or on your desktop which is

00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,830
really difficult and really obnoxious

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,390
and then supporting keyboard navigation

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,640
users should be able to tab through your

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,680
entire page don't allow for keyboard

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,880
traps if someone gets stuck somewhere on

00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,470
a page you should always feel - like

00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,420
back out of it this happens a lot with

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,830
modal's and things like that you enter

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,530
into a modal and then there's no way

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:19,190
like tabbed click the button or exit and

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:20,780
it's really annoying and just remember

00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,970
that accessibility is everyone's

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,860
responsibility if you're a developer and

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,340
getting inaccessible designs don't

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,960
hesitate to push back on them

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,500
remember that semantic hTML goes a long

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,960
way

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,560
and don't change default semantics don't

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,750
make a link act like a button all right

00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,230
it sounds like kind of a lot so testing

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,790
it is very important so some best

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,030
practices that I use in every single

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:48,560
project is first I start with navigating

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,970
the page with my keyboard making sure I

00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,470
don't get into any of those keyboard

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,600
traps I try to do this early because

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,460
it's a lot difficult a lot more

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,640
difficult to come in after the fact and

00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,990
fix this adding accessibility to your

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,020
project checklist just as you would any

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:05,000
other function or feature and then

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:08,450
including accessibility in your browser

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,250
QA process and like I said before

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:17,230
testing early and often is key so one of

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:20,660
my favorite tools to use is just totally

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,460
bookmarklet totally bookmark it

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,200
it's basically you just add it to your

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,810
browser you click on it and it'll show

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,150
an overlay on the screen of all of the

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,280
things wrong this is an example of one

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,770
of our sites at Vox media which is not

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,570
perfect by any means but if you can

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,010
scroll through it and click on the

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,110
different things and it will show you

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,390
what isn't accessible and give you

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:45,590
examples of how to fix it it's really

00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:47,600
helpful this one's good for as you're

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:51,440
designing things color contrast analyzer

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,270
I think it's a Mac app but there's lots

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,930
of tools like this online so you can

00:21:53,270 --> 00:22:00,520
just paste in your color choices and

00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,520
it'll tell you if it's accessible or not

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,390
so that was kind of a lot of stuff so

00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,630
the recap disability affects everyone at

00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,100
any point

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,000
if you have trouble getting buy-in from

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,980
executives and stuff ask for forgiveness

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,380
later just kind of do it if you have the

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,320
time it'll benefit you in the long run

00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,910
and then baby steps count it's not going

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,590
to happen all at once we've been at this

00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,350
now for a few months and that screenshot

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,720
of kind of inaccessible curbed it's

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:33,870
still out there thinking about

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,780
accessibility early and often is very

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,700
important semantic HTML and browser

00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:41,820
defaults go a long way don't overwrite

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,990
how the browser already works and in

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,330
general let's just make our work better

00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,330
so thanks

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:52,870
