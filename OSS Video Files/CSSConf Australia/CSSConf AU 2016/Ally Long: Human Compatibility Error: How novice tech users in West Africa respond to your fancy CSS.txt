We can do so much cool stuff with CSS now! Animations are totally boss. Focus effects are so much fun. We barely even have to worry about browser compatibility any more!

Ok, hold up. What about human compatibility? How does a newbie react to something like an animated input focus effect when trying to fill out an online form? We can probably all fairly easily venture outside our meme bubble and ask a Luddite relative to test our app. But letâ€™s move even further outside the comfort zone. What about people in places with unreliable power and intermittent internet? How does someone who's been introduced to technology through a second-hand cheap Blackberry knock-off powered by a car battery respond to these new and shiny ways of interacting with machines? (Hint: ðŸ˜±) Do animations hinder or help? Does a flat UI give people enough clues about how to use an interface? How can we make sure that keeping up with the cutting edge wonâ€™t alienate people in these fast-growing emerging economies who are just starting to get into the web?
