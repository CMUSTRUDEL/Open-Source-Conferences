	Thank you to Mozilla for making the video recordings possible. 

We've all probably seen discussions about Accelerated Mobile Pages popping up in Twitter, listed in RFPs, or mentioned in job postings. What is "AMP" anyway, and why should we care? AMP is a new approach for building web pages so that they load instantly, and a specification that defines the set of technical functionality we can use to get the job done. The project is backed by Google, Twitter, Vox, and others, and it is rapidly being adopted by publishers across the web. The AMP spec 'forces' us to use techniques like CSS inlining, GPU acceleration, efficient font triggering, and prioritized resource loading... in order to guarantee that our pages meet a baseline level of performance. This talk will provide an introduction to AMP: what the spec is, why we care, and what we need to do to start using it today. Additionally, we'll discuss the best practices that form the foundation of the spec and some lessons we can take from AMP and apply to our general understanding of performance and resource budgeting, even on projects where we can't (or don't want to) embrace AMP right away.
