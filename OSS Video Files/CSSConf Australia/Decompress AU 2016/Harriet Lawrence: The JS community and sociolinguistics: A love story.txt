okay hello everyone I'm Harriet for the

00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,710
last couple of years I've been a

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,270
front-end developer and I've actually

00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,650
just joined build cut as a technical

00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,640
writer so this talk today is about

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,670
community building with the help of

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,840
sociolinguistics so i'll be talking a

00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,440
little bit about what sociolinguistics

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,510
is how it's relevant to us and how we

00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,050
can use their tactics to help make the

00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,309
JavaScript community a better place I'm

00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,629
currently doing my masters of applied

00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,579
linguistics at the University of

00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:39,410
Melbourne which is how I got interested

00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,629
in how traditional language communities

00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,339
are being built so this talk actually

00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:46,280
started life as a paper for my degree

00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:49,159
and it actually still is I'm currently

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,800
prepping it for publication and it turns

00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:55,059
out that condensing 5,000 academic words

00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,050
into a 15 minute talk is kind of odd so

00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:01,039
let's start off with just talking about

00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:02,510
communities so what is a community it's

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,640
really it's just a bunch of people all

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,770
together doing the same thing in

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,740
linguistics we can call this a community

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:12,500
of practice so we all together doing

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,700
shared meaning making and when a new

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,740
person wants to join a new community

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,210
they have to learn how they do things

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,520
differently to the previous communities

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,979
that they've been a member of this is a

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,329
comprised of lots of different things

00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:25,969
some of these are language things so

00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:28,219
jargon or in jokes and some of them are

00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:30,140
cultural so for example the JavaScript

00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:32,719
communities approach to open source

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,420
development or our big focus on

00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,859
diversity and inclusion so all these

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,689
things are kind of social and they're

00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:42,740
they're kind of linguistic and together

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:45,020
we get sociolinguistics so a little bit

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,729
of definition start off with Sergio

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,119
linguistics is the study of how language

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:51,770
functions in a society this is a really

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,750
broad field and it covers way too much

00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,880
stuff for this talk so something more

00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,369
relevant to us today is language

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,939
socialization so becoming a member of a

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,679
society through the use of language I

00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:05,210
know I said I'd this talk was going to

00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:07,009
be about sociolinguistics and I kind of

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,570
lied actually about language

00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,270
socialization that doesn't sound

00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,879
anywhere near as exciting so in the

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,530
traditional language learning sense

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,470
language socialization is all the other

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,760
stuff that you learn when you

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,520
learning a language that is not the

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,170
actual words and you may be familiar

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,120
with when you're learning a language

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,260
it's much easier to learn it when you're

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,910
living in the country that's spoken

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,380
because you get all the other really

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:35,140
important stuff that is not just the

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:36,820
work this is all socialization so being

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,590
a part of a community means that you are

00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,720
helping to build it and we want nice

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,550
communities we want them to make people

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,830
feel welcome and make it easy to join

00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,390
these things are important because we

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,000
want more people to come and be part of

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,300
the JavaScript magic so let's have a

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,550
look at how we can do this better

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,620
javascript hole is actually pretty good

00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:00,520
at these things unlike some other

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,080
communities around you but back to

00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,260
socialization what does this actually

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,170
look like in practice the language that

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,250
we use when we talk about JavaScript so

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,600
you might be a member of lots of

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,880
different programming communities and

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,640
they all have different ways of being a

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,380
member so how do we let people know what

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,959
our special JavaScript way of doing

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,570
things is we use socialization

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,489
strategies ms heed to them and i'm not

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,959
going to cover up all of them but i have

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,519
picked out a bunch of interesting ones

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,580
and i've divided them into three

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,500
categories we've got welcoming

00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,560
strategies line of focus strategies and

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,480
community focus strategies so up first

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,070
we've got welcoming there are two

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,480
different types of welcoming got

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,170
positive welcoming and negative

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,330
welcoming so an example of some positive

00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,549
welcoming maybe I've tweeted this said

00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,019
here's my tiny project I'm letting this

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:52,959
thing and it was hard but it was also

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,810
fun and weathered and here's a link so

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,950
this says to everyone else reading this

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,080
having a hard time learning javascript

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,530
is ok it's normal and being vulnerable

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,660
is also okay so this isn't just good for

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,040
new people joining a community it also

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:11,019
makes people who are already members

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,930
feel more comfortable an example of some

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:16,000
negative welcoming maybe I've done this

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,830
pull request I'm adding a new feature

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,830
and one of my friends comments and says

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,600
oh lo what should I do maybe this is an

00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:25,419
injury maybe we do this every time we do

00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,599
a full request but for those not in the

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,830
know this is not a good time it does

00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,000
make it look like we're part of this

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,440
exclusive group

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,630
you once you become a member of this

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,240
group you get to pay a run out as well

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,830
but that's not actually a good thing it

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,000
actually makes it look like once you

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,010
become a member of the JavaScript

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,660
community will attack the quality of

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,480
your work and will make light of your

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,730
efforts so this can even be alienating

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,290
your existing team members maybe they

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,800
know about your jokes but they're not a

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:58,870
part of it and it could potentially

00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,580
entirely scare off new members so next

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:06,820
up we're going to look at some line of

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:08,050
focus socialization strategies there's a

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,140
lot of different ones I'm going to cover

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,150
a few kind of quickly the first one

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,830
we've got is legitimation so it's going

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,060
to tell learners and members that the

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,510
thing that they are working on is

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,880
legitimate second one we got is

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,560
normalizing failure making sure that

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,900
everyone knows that failure is a normal

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,250
part of working with JavaScript are we

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,530
going to highlight the personal benefits

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,210
for people who are just joining we want

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,190
to show them exactly what they will

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,700
personally get from becoming a member of

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,770
our community growth strategies for

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,050
questioning the teaching people how to

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,070
ask good questions and being open to

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,070
having people ask you questions

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,000
self-efficacy which is supporting

00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:55,360
people's belief in their own ability to

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,700
succeed and finally legitimate

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,300
peripheral participation a lot of words

00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,710
but it's an important one so this is all

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,090
of the different ways that you can

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,010
participate in our community without

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,500
actually writing codes that are still

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,419
important parts of being a member things

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,830
like uploading Stack Overflow questions

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,960
and answers and asking and answering

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,760
these questions ourselves writing blog

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,850
posts tweeting about the new things that

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,900
you've done or challenges that you faced

00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,820
and making all of these different

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,530
activities just as important as writing

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,440
code makes our community a whole lot

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,390
easier to join and it's easier to be

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,190
part of it as an existing member as well

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,690
because you don't want to just have to

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,820
write code all the time to be a

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,320
legitimate JavaScript developer you want

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,090
to have other activities that it just is

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,620
important and more fun so lastly we're

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,690
going to look at some community focus

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,580
strategies

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,650
first up we've got accepted strategies

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,509
for engagement so this is figuring out

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,400
how we best communicate with other

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:56,660
members in our community and clearly

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,130
defining these then active participation

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,380
you want to actually use these

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,550
strategies that we've defined we don't

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,139
want to just hide in a corner and write

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,610
some code by ourselves we want to be

00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:08,840
engaging without other members and

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:11,180
creating value strategies for getting

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,530
help so this is defining how people

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:17,900
should get in touch with you for help

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:19,400
and finally support structures so there

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,870
are lots and lots of different places

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,240
that you can get help in the JavaScript

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,630
community thousands of online tutorials

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,569
is made up Twitter conferences github

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,370
issues flac groups and so many more but

00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:33,710
we need to let people know which ones

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:37,009
they need to go to and that it's okay to

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,840
go to these places so JavaScript does is

00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:40,310
pretty well we are pretty good at

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,259
encouraging people to talk about things

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,479
that have gone badly for them as well as

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,159
things that have gone well and because

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,949
of this we can set the example for

00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:51,409
newcomers by posting about things that

00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,580
we've learnt at every level so it

00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,900
doesn't just have to be junior

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,180
developers writing about their first

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,949
experience with JavaScript or senior

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,440
developers talking about super advanced

00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,639
and deep technical concepts if you post

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,199
about how you've been working with

00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,490
JavaScript for five years and you just

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,130
set up your first expresses over the

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,880
other day or how you finally looked up

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,930
exactly what that node nom's era meant

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,750
this is opening up the conversation

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,340
about learning at all levels and this

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,560
creates and defines the support

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,819
structures of all our members no matter

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,880
where they are in their JavaScript

00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:27,590
journey so let's recap socialization is

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,940
all of these different things that we do

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,130
to become a member of a new community

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,320
and all the things that I've talked

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,430
about today are all used all the time in

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,169
traditional language learning and

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,469
they're really effective at building

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,360
grid language communities all of these

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:44,300
things we can start using our

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,709
programming communities so let's start

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,360
thinking about the language that you

00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:49,160
that we're using when we interact with

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,110
our fellow developers when we're

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,730
training new team members when friends

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,920
ask about JavaScript or start using it

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,120
for the first time especially when we

00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,430
post on the internet about

00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,870
javascript by thinking about the

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,180
language that we use when we talk about

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,430
JavaScript each of us can make our

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,230
community a friendlier more comfortable

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,110
and more welcoming place for new people

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:13,350
and new ideas thanks

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,350
