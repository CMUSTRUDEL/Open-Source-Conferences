hi I'm Boris from Lerna one sign point

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,779
and I have a question to Chris Epstein

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:10,490
you mentioned for when you're

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,490
implementing new features can hear me

00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:16,580
okay so for Chris voice from our an

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:21,740
ambulance I'd point you mentioned when

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:26,730
considering features you are looking at

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:32,040
straight for debugging and knowing how

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:34,500
it works for deliveries away and being

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,510
intuitive but what about if there's a

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,629
feature that's violating these

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,059
principles in the current release I

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:45,149
actually came across that case and just

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,460
last week and it's the aliasing of

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,460
variable names with dashes and

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,230
underscores so what happened was that in

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,440
this course there was a guy who's

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,039
refactoring the variables and hit the

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,230
link - color variable at the top of the

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,110
file and then as part of his refactoring

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,670
he decided to change the variables and

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,950
the work-in-progress have been

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,650
underscored so we had link underscore

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,650
color somewhere else and I used it

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,090
somewhere else in the files and then I

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,500
wasn't getting the right color for a

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,960
long time and then just by sheer chance

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,570
I came across the other variable with

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,960
underscore that was overriding the

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,479
dashed one so what about hiding it under

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,159
a feature or configuration let me

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,409
explain the the summarize basically you

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,479
had some your two variables the that

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,280
were the exact same characters but they

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,640
varied in terms of whether they use

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,590
underscores or dashes so there is a

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,840
feature in sass where you can use

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,960
underscores or dashes they are basically

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,640
interchangeable in a variable name and

00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,939
the reason for that is an aesthetic

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,009
choice because some developers really

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,770
like underscores and some developers

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,860
really like dashes and the person who

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,319
writes your framework might have liked a

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,200
different kind of variable aesthetic

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,770
choice than you did and we want you to

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,950
have

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,340
of a very pleasant aesthetic experience

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,620
in the file that you're looking at the

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,890
one that is the choice of that you get

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,270
to in the code that you author you get

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,050
you get to make that aesthetic choice

00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,730
and so we made a decision to allow

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,560
basically Fascism scores to be

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,280
interchangeable so that you had a

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,020
beautiful stylesheet

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:45,780
the downside of that is you might not

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:58,500
expect that feature everything is a

00:02:45,780 --> 00:03:01,140
trade-off sorry got a question for the

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,200
whole panel what is your favorite

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,240
feature that's coming in the next

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:14,370
version of CSS that we should look out

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:17,930
for the matches pseudo selector it'll be

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:21,990
cool they'll be able to use variables

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:25,670
yeah probably dynamic variables I go

00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,670
with everyone else and I want variables

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,090
until now said the variables I'm pretty

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:49,500
excited about a few things

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:50,970
chronic gradients among them like Anna

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,470
said I'm also really excited about

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,270
connect gradients although it doesn't

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,520
seem they'll make it in browsers anytime

00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:59,010
soon because they're not implemented by

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,170
the graphics libraries that they use I

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,730
actually suggested connect gradients

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,800
several years ago and wrote the first

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,250
draft of the spec that that's now in

00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,980
image values for I'm also really excited

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,959
about corner shape which will enable us

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,320
to do like cutout corners and inner

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,760
border radius stuff when like corners

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,940
say bevel will allow us to make

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,790
triangles and and octagons and hexagons

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,130
and all sorts trapezoids all sorts of

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,050
shapes that are really difficult today

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:32,400
and of course also

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:37,169
variables and nesting and yeah that's

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:41,099
about it you're excited about all of the

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:43,680
things I guess because I come at things

00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:47,009
from a more like architectural

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,210
perspective I am excited about variables

00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:51,360
but I really wish we would have

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,460
something more like extents in CSS

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,699
natively so sorry I'm kind of answering

00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:00,599
the questioning kind of not high I'm

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:03,479
most excited about shape because it kind

00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:07,919
of breaks us out of that idea that the

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,319
web is always this box and yeah it's

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:16,979
just something that will kind of change

00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:19,430
things up a little bit maybe two but to

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:22,379
not repeat oh it's a maybe just more

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:26,129
creative features like filters and play

00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:29,240
modes and your shapes and kind of

00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:36,539
regions where we can cut out text and

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:39,330
yeah things I noticed a few people did

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,699
say get better tab earlier and that was

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,539
really awesome so thanks guys question

00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:48,060
on front here hi my name is David I just

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:53,960
got a question around this was touched

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:56,490
on by Chris about CSS testing Griffin

00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,599
and I'm just interested in around

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,830
solutions around testing layouts maybe

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:04,050
Nikolas and Connor might have some

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,500
opinions on this so incorporating that

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:11,069
into your CI testing or your test Suites

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,560
or in your get pr's have anybody has

00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:17,849
anybody had solutions around how to test

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:22,500
layout it bugs that might come in from

00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:24,990
CSS changes and solutions around that so

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,479
there's a few ways you can do that now

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,270
most of them kind of revolve around like

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,129
a headless browser like phantom there's

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,889
a kind of brute force ways that you can

00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,509
render a page and then take his image of

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,060
both of them in a particular state and

00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,680
then do like an image comparison and you

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,070
can plug that into your CI and you can

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,380
say

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,390
if the image is different between like

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,720
the last command in this command then

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,620
you know we consider the layout broken

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,500
and then there's things like Casper

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,240
jeaious which let you run kind of more

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,080
extensive tests and you can do like

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,360
computed style comparisons there or you

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,920
can use bass with phantom j/s that'll

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,630
work too so you can write a CSS

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,910
assertion that says okay well I expect

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,080
the height of this to be 10 pixels or

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,790
whatever and it'll run against the

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,870
computed style there so there's a few

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:18,060
different ways you can do it yeah does

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:20,730
that answer your question yeah I think

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,730
the visual diffing which is what Chris

00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,050
was sensing out with this quote so this

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,800
is a screenshot comparison stuff that's

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:32,880
how I think most companies with large

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,340
applications are going so Facebook do it

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,090
in fact the Instagram team wrote a tool

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,610
called Huxley the kind of fills in part

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,490
of that tool chain the BBC wrote

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,170
something called Wraith this phantom CSS

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,580
as well which also gives you an API for

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,380
taking screenshots and clicking around

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,000
so you can kind of do user flows and

00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,300
take screenshots along the way

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,710
and Google wrote one which is slightly

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,460
different in character to the others

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,630
called depicted which is like yeah I

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,510
think more of an end to anything where

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,890
you can have rendered your entire render

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,090
entire pages and take screenshots and it

00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,710
gives you information about where the

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,810
differences are and that's really good

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,010
for being able to test things that

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,740
you're not even necessarily sure you

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,330
need to check for regressions on so

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,530
rather than knowing ahead of time that

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,900
you want to check like the size of a

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,340
button you kind of just get feedback as

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,780
soon as you inadvertently break

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,880
something so I think that's so pretty

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,020
that's pretty useful but yeah I haven't

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:31,620
got a huge amount of experience working

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:34,290
with Nicholas your ideas around

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,719
components do you think that precursor

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:39,140
to the web component components standard

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,830
or do you think it's more complimentary

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:47,370
did you say more complimentary yeah yeah

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,990
I mean I guess in some level it's like a

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,930
precursor to it that there'll be aspects

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,190
of existing component based approaches

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,889
that you'll be able to roll into web

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,049
components

00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:58,449
but I also think that by the time we get

00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:59,619
web components in a state that's

00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:01,869
something you can use in production that

00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:04,119
a lot of library code authors will

00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:06,189
already like got different approaches

00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:09,009
like if you look at how react works like

00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:12,579
under the hood it's it's doing something

00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:14,529
different to what web components is

00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:16,589
planning to do at least the last time I

00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,809
looked so web components is based around

00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:21,429
using mutation observers so you kind of

00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,739
can look at an object and when it

00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:24,939
changes then you get like you get

00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:27,429
informed about that change and then you

00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:29,559
can update your view whereas react

00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:32,109
doesn't really do that it's kind of more

00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,359
like how video games work where they

00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:35,559
kind of they have to know about the

00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:37,449
existing state of things they just

00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:39,489
basically rerender every single time

00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:41,259
like so the implementation is really

00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:42,879
efficient that react to users but it's

00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:45,429
effectively just drawing new frames

00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,689
every time so yeah I don't know if

00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:48,910
that's something that will eventually

00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:50,709
make it into browsers but I quite like

00:09:48,910 --> 00:10:11,610
thinking like that it's feels quite

00:09:50,709 --> 00:10:11,610
simple for everyone

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:34,519
there's no silly questions okay so my

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,619
questions about when browser features

00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,239
intersect with like pre processes so in

00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:39,170
case of variables and a lot of things

00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:41,899
come in the future

00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:43,819
is there a reason that browser vendors

00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,889
go down the way of all the spec authors

00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:47,569
got on the way of not lamenting things

00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:50,600
that have been done in pre processes so

00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:51,949
a naive example B variables is there

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,149
reason to use a different syntax when

00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:54,379
people already accustomed to is that

00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,110
they're a semantic difference that I

00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:59,480
want to confuse people by or is a reason

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,920
to not use what's relatively popular

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,970
usage already and to go a different

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,429
track and is there like a way for maybe

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:17,629
spec authors and pre process authors to

00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:18,679
kind of work closer together and Leo do

00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:29,360
you what do you want to take this or

00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:30,889
should I take a crack at it so for

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,389
example for variables the reason that

00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:34,429
syntax is different is because CSS

00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:36,110
variables are not exactly variables

00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,879
right now they're custom properties so

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,889
they're actually more flexible than

00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:42,980
variables in pre processors for other

00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:44,629
modules the reasons might be sometimes

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,569
different for example nesting has a

00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:48,889
different syntax because CSS has

00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:50,839
different needs from preprocessors

00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,160
pre-processors only need around once so

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,759
their performance needs are very

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,199
different

00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:58,939
so with nesting specific for example if

00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:01,160
we implemented nesting in the same way

00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:04,100
that pre-processors do there were

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,929
parsing problems basically to figure out

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,470
if something was a declaration or an

00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:11,989
entire new CSS rule you you know you

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:14,660
needed to have infinite look ahead which

00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:17,149
is a pretty bad thing for performance

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,040
when you're writing a parser which is

00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:22,189
why they need to start with a specific

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,720
token that's the same every time it was

00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:25,910
a none percent but I think the syntax

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,009
has changed now

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,449
whereas in preprocessors the ampersand

00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:31,309
is optional because they only run once

00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:33,799
so infinite look-ahead is not that big

00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:35,650
of a problem so the reason the syntax is

00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:37,270
different between preprocessors and CS

00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,680
different depending on the case

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,150
sometimes it's it's a different

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,490
implementation of things other times

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,560
it's just different needs it really

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,520
depends on the case but we are

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,920
monitoring

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,630
preprocessors and trying to implement

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:56,130
these things in CSS whenever it's

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:56,130
possible does that answer the question

00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,690
thanks Magazine

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:18,700
maybe we should really start giving

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:20,560
those away valia your talk you started

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,630
talking about some sub pixel

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,290
anti-aliasing and later on you started

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,870
using examples with alpha blending in

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:32,260
text now as far as I know you can't use

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:40,360
some sub pixel into anything and alpha

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:44,260
blending am I wrong in that yeah when it

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,120
comes to the text yeah krome disabled

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,730
some sub pixel anti-aliasing when you

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,959
have a paucity less than one and in

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:54,279
several other cases so I guess I mean it

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,620
makes sense if you think about it how

00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:59,980
would you implement it it's it's not

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,680
exactly easy is it technically

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,610
impossible or is it just a very very

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,040
hard problem I honestly don't know if

00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,209
it's technically impossible but it's

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,470
pretty obvious that it's more difficult

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:16,510
and since browsers disable it when you

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:23,920
have when you need alpha blending maybe

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:25,690
I'd I really don't know it might be too

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,640
much calculation to do on the fly for

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,250
text it might make the rendering of the

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,140
text too slow or the scrolling of the

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,650
page too slow when that kind of text is

00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,540
on there

00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,580
I think browser vendors are constantly

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,589
having to make trade-offs between

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,180
rendering things as exactly as they'd

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:41,709
like to and rendering them so that

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,800
they're going to scroll fast enough and

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,240
animate fast enough and perhaps and I

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,800
don't know for sure this is a case where

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,100
they've made a trade-off and turn it off

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,420
in order to make it more perform

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,060
that's entirely possible grayscale

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,189
anti-aliasing is much less

00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,689
computationally expensive so could be

00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:16,389
that could be the reason but we're just

00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:17,829
speculating here hi my name is Luke I'm

00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:20,230
just wondering with all the changes

00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,519
around components and dependencies and

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,759
the way we're dealing with a lot of

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,790
stuff now more programmatically in CSS

00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:30,100
like in terms of CSS architectures if

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,319
any of the you guys have come across

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,790
when you've had to have big changes in

00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:37,749
your architecture how you've handled it

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:39,129
and like how you sort of let everyone in

00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:42,370
the team know what's sort of happening

00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:44,709
and how you can to like save even just

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,870
basic things like switching to using

00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:49,809
something like Bower or component or

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,660
changing from say using the sort of

00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:55,959
separate CSS and JavaScript folders to

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,220
using actual components just more like

00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,779
because there's no that keeps changing

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,220
as well it's gonna feels like it's gonna

00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:01,959
keep changing with web components and

00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,589
what sort of your strategies are around

00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:09,250
that so I work in a pretty big team and

00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:12,069
our CSS is going to be very soon shared

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,449
across multiple teams building different

00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:15,250
products but they're all meant to look

00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:17,370
like they go together and so the ideas

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,269
we're gonna share components across them

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,439
the thing that we've found that's been

00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,730
really effective is something we're

00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:24,480
calling style guide driven development

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,410
which is that you build out your

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,569
components and your pieces into the

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,100
style guide first get them generally

00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:31,629
validated make sure they're all cleaned

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,550
up get a design pass to make sure all

00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:37,420
the animations are right and the timings

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:40,029
are correct and only once there they are

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,100
validated as as functioning the way you

00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,689
want them to then actually using them in

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,120
a in a section of the app or in a

00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:47,769
section of the you know page or

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,509
something like that and that's been

00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:51,100
particularly effective at keeping us all

00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,749
on the same page and making sure that

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,999
we've got a bunch of tables where you

00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:56,589
can add stuff to the table and you can

00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:58,779
delete stuff from the table and you can

00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:00,759
sort the table and so it's our kitchen

00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,399
sink table audible believable sortable

00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,520
and we've got the most sort of all over

00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,020
the

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,970
site we wanted to make sure that they

00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,290
stayed in sync with each other and so

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,990
having that live in the style guide

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,400
first has sort of helped with that but I

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,170
would say it's an ongoing process at

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,050
least for us I don't know how you guys

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:19,390
have found it but it's something that

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,400
requires kind of vigilance as well maybe

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:25,110
there are some other ways but so far it

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,110
just seems like developers have to care

00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:45,010
Ahmadi I'm actually interested in to

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:49,230
find out what's the weirdest or most

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,230
frustrating issue you've had with CSS

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,500
there's something I want to do and it's

00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:06,850
not really easier so if you have a list

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:11,140
and you take an item out by either like

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:15,700
display:none or so the tab should emit

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:18,700
and to make that like really fast and

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:23,440
performance it's kind of impossible I

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:28,390
mean we can animate the height it's just

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,870
not fast and somehow us hope maybe that

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:40,570
we can add a transition to how page

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:43,720
flows but basically just add remove

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:48,430
stuff and have performant kind of

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:56,020
transitions that kind of my wish for

00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:59,110
some time here so a really weird issue

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:02,350
with CSS animations is that for example

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,930
I can't I can't remember the case where

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,970
I stumbled on it but a really

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:11,230
characteristic example is if you have a

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:13,510
CSS animation of border that goes from 0

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,730
solid black to a hundred pixels solid

00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,550
black and it's like a keyframe animation

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,780
so you

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,270
by the animation and you don't see

00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,860
anything and you're stuck wondering why

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,050
on earth there's no animation happening

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,000
here and then you realize that border is

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,610
essentially border width border style

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,080
and border color and it's like it's

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,700
exactly the same as if you were on the

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,850
mating all three separately and because

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,410
border border style is not animatable it

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,080
gets completely dropped from the

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,180
keyframes so it's it's as if it doesn't

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,180
exist and since it doesn't exist you get

00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:48,260
the default border style which is none

00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:49,970
so you don't see any border and we

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,100
actually resolved to change this

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,940
behavior in a CSS working group meeting

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,110
in the 2012 in late 2012 and browsers

00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,420
still haven't changed their

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,310
implementations so you can still if you

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:07,100
try out that this sort of animation

00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:08,720
you'll still see the issue today my pet

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,730
hate and CSS is something that's

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,170
unfortunately unavoidable which is that

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,400
there are a whole class of different

00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,380
problems that create circular

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,200
dependencies so one that I hit recently

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,000
was have you heard of the V H and V W

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,990
units they are the best thing in the

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,200
world so it's 0 to 100 relative to the

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:29,750
viewport so like people with a viewport

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,370
height makes it really really easy for

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:35,810
creating responsive viewers and things

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:38,750
like that the problem is that the

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:41,210
different browsers incorporate the they

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:45,410
don't count the scrollbar width as part

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,450
of the V H and V W units and the reason

00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,070
for that is if they did and the

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,720
scrollbar disappeared or it came back

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,340
there would be a circular dependency

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,220
which means that would like not be able

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,780
to resolve whether it was supposed to be

00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,420
you know slightly larger or slightly

00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,340
smaller and I can't remember the exact

00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,480
implementation details but that kind of

00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,980
thing is really annoying because it gets

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,530
in the way of what could potentially be

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,570
a good feature and then like say in

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:11,870
Firefox which renders at least on the

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,640
Mac the scrollbar is a opaque object

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,490
there's a whole bunch of stuff sliding

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,650
underneath it if you use 100 V W so

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:23,320
that's really annoying and also a quirk

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:23,320
of the way that CSS styles are resolved

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,570
one time I was animating an entire list

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,640
it was essentially a menu navigation I

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,620
was animating it in and i was animating

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:40,270
it in by a point

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:42,430
I think 0.85 M amount translate and what

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:45,940
I found is in that particular translate

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:49,390
because I was doing 0.85 M's in some

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,680
browsers it would when the translate

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,140
happened it would actually create gaps

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,990
in between the objects as it was

00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,080
animating down because it was like with

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,730
summarize example with when he had 15

00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,860
pixels for something it was actually

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,170
trying to calculate in between the gaps

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,790
and so I had kept having these see

00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,740
through things and I found that in I

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,500
think I remember exactly what browsers

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,700
it was I think Firefox might have been

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,650
one of them but I don't want to pick on

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:19,450
Firefox I've had a go I have folks meet

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:21,100
today yeah it was pretty pretty dirty

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,500
and I ended up having to completely

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,320
change my approach I'm gonna have to

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,900
interrupt the it's like a CSS therapy

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,750
session no we're gonna have two more

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:35,650
quick questions and then that's it and I

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:38,710
think I've already picked them sorry hi

00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,930
my questions to Anna specifically and a

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,360
little bit later as well when you're

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:46,360
crafting the advanced CSS examples that

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:51,520
you do how do you do it

00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:53,350
I I tried making the Taurus that you've

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,680
done in a previous example and it

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:58,180
completely fell apart yeah I just love

00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,040
to know how you go through and actually

00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,040
create something that looks like that

00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:14,790
actually I start with a notebook and a

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:18,640
set of colored pens and the Taurus in

00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:22,000
particular I saw an animated gif and it

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,730
wasn't exactly like my Taurus but I got

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,460
an idea and I started from there and I

00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:34,830
thought I want to have something like if

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,830
you know what a hippo cichlid is

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:43,110
yeah something like that well it's

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:48,570
basically sort of a roller that runs on

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:52,110
a circle and draws these arcs that touch

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:56,429
the circle so I thought create something

00:23:52,110 --> 00:24:00,330
like that and the equations are pretty

00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:03,240
simple and I just went from there and

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:06,929
the torus is basically you distribute on

00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:11,070
a Pentagon you distribute some segments

00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:12,659
and then you distribute every ring with

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:16,769
those segments you distribute them

00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:21,659
around but in general every example I I

00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:23,999
just started I draw it and some idea

00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:27,720
some kind of flowchart of how I'm gonna

00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:36,779
do the calculations and that's basically

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:38,850
it usually when I start making a talk

00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:41,279
every time I want to present something I

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:43,019
try to think how would I how would they

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,700
understand this better if I didn't know

00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:48,029
this if I was learning it for the first

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:50,490
time and how like how would it be better

00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:53,909
explained it's a bit like it's a bit

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:55,889
like thinking about usability it with

00:24:53,909 --> 00:25:00,029
the difference that the audience is the

00:24:55,889 --> 00:25:02,249
user and the slides are the UI but the

00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:04,619
the whole way of thinking is basically

00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:07,139
the same and sometimes it changes over

00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:09,330
time like for example whether in when I

00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,850
first made the slides for this talk the

00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,470
RGB cube in the beginning of my talk was

00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,529
just an image I found on google images

00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:20,700
and then one night I decided to change

00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:21,990
it and code an CSS cube with like SVG

00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,610
gradients for the different sides

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,269
because you can't make that with CSS

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:31,710
gradients or the hwv system was like a

00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:33,330
slide with it was just a static slide

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,129
and then I decided to implement the

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:38,190
algorithm in JavaScript so I could show

00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:41,700
how the the code would work it's it's

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:45,720
it's a it's a process of evolution over

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:48,430
time they I think of an idea okay this

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,500
would be better explained in a

00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,180
different way for example I don't like

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,400
the way I'm explaining alpha blending in

00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,170
this talk so I keep thinking how would I

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,510
explain it in the graphical way cuz

00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,570
people can process that much code at

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:03,640
once so I don't think it's very well

00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:06,010
explained but showing like eight lines

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,530
of JavaScript or however long it is so

00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,480
at some point I'm hoping I will figure

00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:14,770
out a way to show it graphically and

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,550
then that slide will change as well hope

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,550
that makes some sense

00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:25,240
hey I'm Julia I flew in from Perth today

00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,760
and it's been really good it's worth it

00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,460
I was this is question for the whole

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,960
team I was learning what the catalyst

00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,970
was in your lives that put you on the

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,920
path where you are now like was a

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,540
startup you worked on did you just try

00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,679
really hard at uni do you have to bend

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,679
over backwards to someone

00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:59,440
we just we didn't hear it I said I said

00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:04,179
did you have to bend over backwards for

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:08,769
someone the thing that put me on the

00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:11,710
path was actually a very long time ago I

00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:14,080
was a teenager and I know I looked like

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:21,419
a teenager now but I was actually taken

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:24,639
ager about 20 years ago and yeah had

00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:26,409
bands that I was in as a kid and I

00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:29,799
wanted to make websites for those bands

00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:31,779
and so music got me into doing what I do

00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:33,609
today essentially because I made

00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:38,710
websites for friends bands and my own

00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:42,700
band I think I kind of covered it today

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:45,429
but I think - there were two kind of

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,960
little key things one was moving to

00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:49,119
Paris and being bored I was an illegal

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,429
immigrant and so I couldn't work and so

00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:57,070
I started reading w3c specifications to

00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:58,659
pass the time and that helped and the

00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,009
other was that I was dating a guy who

00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:02,950
said he couldn't sleep at night if my

00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:08,259
website didn't validate should I better

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:10,239
figure out what validate means it's dude

00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:14,259
it's two separate events I got into

00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:15,909
coding when I was about 12 I just really

00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,649
liked making things so when I got a

00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:20,859
computer of my own after a lot of

00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:22,299
convincing towards my parents please get

00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:24,340
me a computer please get me a computer

00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:26,979
so eventually they did and they realized

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,659
that I could make stuff that's actually

00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:30,669
useful for people because until then I

00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:33,759
used like paper and scissors and stuff

00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:36,999
to make things that weren't particularly

00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:39,909
useful so coding seemed so much more

00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:42,729
creative so I got a book about visual

00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:44,799
C++ and I didn't understand the thing so

00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:46,539
then I got a book about Visual Basic 6

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,429
and that was easier to understand so I

00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:50,529
started with Visual Basic 6 and I was

00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:53,470
coding only with Visual Basic 6 for the

00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:55,089
like the next seven years

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,210
and then we made a forum with a friend

00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:58,940
of mine so I started

00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,560
wanting to tweak things so back then it

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:04,900
was with bullet and back then it didn't

00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:07,430
have a plug-in system so I looked up

00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,350
basically its plugins were find this

00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,120
piece and the code and change it so I

00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,920
did that and I started noticing that

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:20,720
peach be sort of made sense as a

00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:22,310
language I was young so I started with

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,350
PHP and then I wanted to make more

00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:26,660
interactive things so I learned I tried

00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,850
to learn JavaScript and then I

00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,470
discovered how cool CSS can be because I

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,390
was always into graphical things like

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,190
even in my early years in coding I was

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,110
making like color pickers and drawing

00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,800
applications and stuff like that so

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:46,550
obviously I fell in love with CSS and

00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:49,610
we're together until today well I've

00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:53,030
always loved visual stuff and when time

00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:56,900
sort mathematics I was really interested

00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:59,360
I can't remember a time when I wasn't my

00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:02,120
dad really loves flowers and he'd bring

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,360
them into my room during the winter

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:08,000
because it was too cold for them and he

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,280
had to tie them off so they wouldn't you

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,710
know cover the entire space and I used

00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:15,440
to wake up every morning and look at the

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:18,230
wires tying them up and try to imagine

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,320
geometric shapes formed by those wires

00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:22,910
and when it comes to coding my first

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,030
experience I didn't even know it was

00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,740
called that I I just basically got in

00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,050
your toy and I started playing with it

00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,270
and there was this small booklet and

00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,340
after that it was just me and my

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:38,150
imagination and doing visual stuff and

00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:40,670
nasty stuff because I love Jonny Quest

00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:42,620
and other cartoons and my mom wanted to

00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:45,680
watch a soap opera so I basically wrote

00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:48,760
a bit of code to show no signal because

00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,760
I had

00:30:53,509 --> 00:31:03,769
she never found out no and I really

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,330
didn't know I didn't know what

00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:08,659
programming was until I got into

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:11,120
University and I got to study this in

00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:13,159
university because it was a hot day and

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,679
I entered into into the first building

00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:17,870
and there was a guy recruiting students

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:23,299
and I didn't want to walk any further

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:26,330
because it was too hot so do it CSS it

00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:28,970
was a matter of going go to a

00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:31,519
supermarket and wanting to buy something

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,230
cold but it was hot so I thought I'd

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,029
make a blog to shame them except they

00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,159
fall asleep before writing anything on

00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:39,350
it and later I started writing about

00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,919
Formula One on it and wanted to change

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:44,330
it and I thought some I didn't know what

00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,690
I was changing I didn't know that thing

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:50,929
was called CSS but I thought well with

00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:53,950
sounds pretty self-explanatory hex color

00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:58,309
names sounded pretty self-explanatory I

00:31:53,950 --> 00:32:01,399
broke it I have no clue what that

00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:04,549
was and I broke it and I had nobody to

00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:10,549
ask and so I started googling the stuff

00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:12,230
I had changed and that was it so I think

00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:14,559
like a lot of the other people in this

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,570
panel I got a computer

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,460
my family had a computer and I just

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,710
liked to know what was inside things and

00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,480
what made them work so I kind of looked

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,450
physically inside it and virtually

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,179
inside it and kind of pulled it apart of

00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:33,289
it

00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:36,350
sometimes irreparably in terms of like I

00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:38,600
don't know academic pods or careers like

00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:40,369
I did terribly in school barely even

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,379
finished high school and I dropped out

00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:43,999
of university and the only reason I

00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:46,850
actually got into the career that I'm

00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:49,419
Ian imagine into was nepotism like my

00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:52,269
dad worked in

00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:54,729
in you know a workplace it had a good

00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:56,259
first job for me and so yeah he like

00:32:54,729 --> 00:32:58,359
pulled some strings and got me in the

00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:00,129
door and and it's kind of humbling to

00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,629
think back to that like a lot of people

00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:03,639
like to think oh yeah I'm here because

00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:05,889
I'm just so smart and you know everyone

00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:07,989
loves me and I've just you know all of

00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:09,519
this stuff I've made for myself and I

00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:12,519
like to think back to that and I think

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,229
well if I hadn't had that opportunity I

00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:15,759
probably wouldn't be where I am so yeah

00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:22,989
it's pretty much all been luck actually

00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:25,659
I didn't know what code was until I was

00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:28,359
about 24 so I studied anthropology at

00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:31,179
University and after I finished my

00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,009
Master's I was just pretty sure that I

00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:34,839
wasn't ready to do a PhD so I thought

00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:36,820
I'd take a bit of time off and a bit of

00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,339
time I've turned into about two years of

00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:42,549
being unemployed and during those two

00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:44,379
years I was basically anything I really

00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,899
did was trained at this boxing gym and

00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:48,309
the guy who ran it became a friend of

00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,099
mine and one day he was like you want to

00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:52,269
take do you want to do my website for me

00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:54,789
because the guy who was doing it at the

00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:57,219
time was like moving away or something

00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:59,950
and they might not you my EBT I agreed

00:33:57,219 --> 00:34:02,320
and I got handed like a zip file for the

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,639
PHP code and I basically didn't

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,889
understand anything so I throw it away

00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:07,959
and started learning because it was too

00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:10,869
late to say I can't do your web so for

00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:13,779
you and yeah that was kind of it after

00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:17,649
about I know a few months of that I

00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:18,669
realized that I was working on all of

00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:20,740
this stuff while learning things without

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:23,409
anyone telling me a hottie which was

00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,849
probably the first time in my life that

00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:26,500
I hadn't had to have like a pressure of

00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:28,539
you know exams or something to motivate

00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,190
me to do so and then I thought I may as

00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:35,559
well get a job doing this and yeah I

00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:39,669
know where stuff happened so I built a

00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:42,609
lot of Legos as a kid and this will tie

00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:44,049
in I promise yeah as a kid we had Lego

00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:47,259
so I built stuff and that's inherently

00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:48,909
creative right I suggested it I guess if

00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:50,619
you have kids get them Legos when I have

00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,230
kids I'm gonna get them Legos it worked

00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:55,119
out for me there they came out with a

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,029
product called Lego Mindstorms does

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,480
anybody know what that is cool yeah so

00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:02,900
basically you could make robots and you

00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,150
know come stock with some

00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,670
I mean at the time it was pretty janky

00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,859
but you like have a block that says go

00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,079
forward four spaces and you sort of

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:13,910
click it together and there's a UI and I

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,950
got really bored with that and I found

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,140
out that people could like flash the

00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:21,140
firmware of the hardware and then write

00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,059
C code and I didn't know what C code was

00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,039
but it looked real and complicated and

00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:27,349
that made me feel good I realize I'm

00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:30,289
really bad at that this is really hard

00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:32,599
or whatever so I guess basically the way

00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:35,000
I sort of bounced between starting there

00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:36,470
like building cool stuff and then kind

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
of getting into programming some heavy

00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,230
programming and then realize I'm not

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
very good at that

00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:43,789
I sort of fled something I thought I

00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,069
would be good at which is sort of I

00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:48,140
guess what became design so I kind of

00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:53,119
always went back and forth so it worked

00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:56,029
for like a tech agency that was all they

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,650
just built software back in like 99 so

00:35:56,029 --> 00:36:00,349
it worked out well for them with the

00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,789
whole bust and everything but basically

00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:04,520
I went in there I was like I can make

00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:07,190
some cool animated gifs that's cool and

00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,680
they were like yeah so we kind of do

00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:12,109
HTML and CSS or not at the time I guess

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,599
it was all tables so I was like well

00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:15,670
that's cool I'll try to do that and

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,640
because I'm not very good at drawing

00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:22,059
still not so I did that for a while and

00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,760
sort of didn't even know what CSS was

00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:27,619
until I think wow I can't believe this

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,990
just came to me I think it was a podcast

00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:31,250
by dan cedar home or they he was a guest

00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,990
if you know who he is

00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,839
and he was talking about something about

00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:39,200
CSS so I thought I should read up on

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,430
that and so I got pretty good at that

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,020
because I wasn't good at designing

00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:44,599
things and I didn't go to school for

00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,730
design school so excuse me I didn't go

00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:49,010
to school for design so I thought I

00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:53,270
would compensate by learning how to make

00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:54,859
other people's designs work yeah so on

00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:57,349
the flip side I'm more of a designer

00:36:54,859 --> 00:37:00,170
right like I said I don't know I just

00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:01,819
grew up looking at things like ads and I

00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,740
could tell the ones that were like

00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:05,750
really crappy and the ones that looked

00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,490
really good the billboards I don't know

00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,289
what that is but I don't know if you had

00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,210
that but some people just can't tell and

00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:13,490
I remember as a kid walk like going down

00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,330
Bowling Green Kentucky which is a small

00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,010
town

00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:18,920
and seeing really crappy local ads

00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:22,100
versus the I don't know the 80s it felt

00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,710
cool so I always when I was building

00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,590
stuff with code I always strove or

00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,390
strived I don't know to make it good

00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:31,700
looking or what I thought was good

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:34,220
looking and I surrounded my people I

00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,630
surrounded myself with people that were

00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,120
really good designers and made really

00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,860
good aesthetic like print design and

00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,960
since I knew how to code I try to take

00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,390
and steal what they did and try to make

00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,000
it look good on the web and basically

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:52,360
that's what I do every day is steal

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,360
that's why I came here anyways that's it

00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:58,640
right so about 30 years ago my dad came

00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,430
into my room and put a computer on my

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,410
desk and said here you go because they

00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:07,340
had a new computer at work and I got his

00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:09,020
hand me down and I said what do you do

00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:12,680
with the computer and he said you

00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:15,140
program it so it became a programmer at

00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,390
a young age I made of what I made a

00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:21,650
program to manage my paper route when I

00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:25,220
was a boy I had a billing system and all

00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:26,990
kinds of great stuff ah fast forward I

00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,240
went to Caltech to be a physics major

00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:32,870
and instead of flunking out I changed my

00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:37,580
major to CS and got a degree in

00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:40,820
engineering and software and then ended

00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:43,850
up in doing web stuff and then and I

00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:48,320
hated CSS oh my god it's such a pile of

00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:50,270
 and I used to interview everybody

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,700
and I'd be like what are three things

00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:55,310
you would change about CSS if you could

00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,410
just change CSS and they people would be

00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:00,160
like what no you just write CSS that's

00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:02,210
fine and you don't get the job go away

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,620
because you're not thinking about your

00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:06,500
tools you're not thinking that these are

00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:09,130
things that are possibly mutable and

00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:12,230
then one day I touched a thing that

00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:15,080
changed CSS and I said ooh I want to

00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,580
make that so I started playing with it

00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,210
and really loving it

00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:22,700
one day I a contractor that had been

00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:26,180
working with us said hey I'm doing this

00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:29,030
consulting gig at this little consulting

00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,970
place called pivotal labs

00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,650
we're Nicole works and why don't you

00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,910
come up and just like have lunch with us

00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,560
and tell us what you have been doing

00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,850
because I've worked with you and I think

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,980
what you're making is pretty awesome

00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,780
I'm like all right and I thought like

00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,160
when I said yes I thought like literally

00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,140
come and sit down and eat lunch with

00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,210
like six people and it turns out they do

00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,480
these TechTalk lunches and I was being

00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:53,270
invited to come and speak in front of

00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,580
Silicon Valley engineers and I had never

00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:58,910
gave a presentation in my life and I was

00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:01,610
 myself and that video is still

00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:07,310
online you can watch me being really bad

00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:08,900
at talking to people I really thought I

00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:24,800
was on to something and I just kept at

00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:27,860
it and today didn't go well feel is more

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,310
like so I was doing music as a hobby and

00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:33,710
then I did a website to just upload my

00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:35,930
music so people can listen to it and

00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:39,860
then I figured okay I like the visual

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:43,190
more than the music so I went into like

00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:49,820
doing websites and I actually got sucked

00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:58,340
into the dark part being flash but you

00:40:49,820 --> 00:41:00,440
to know it's it's good because I really

00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:03,590
liked it because it had animation and

00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:09,760
all those stuff and now your CSS kind of

00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:09,760
caught up and now I'm doing CSS here

00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:23,020
okay sorry

00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:25,650
no I we're not saying that that was the

00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:30,240
opening yeah absolutely

00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,240
