hello so thanks for coming and I'm gonna

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:14,929
talk about styling your strings and I

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:19,590
wouldn't take that too literally in fact

00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:21,810
that was the title for a long time and I

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,640
was to say oh okay this is maybe too

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,080
negative so I changed it and later maybe

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,610
you're gonna see if this actually would

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,540
make sense or not quick introductions so

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:42,300
on the Internet I'm simmer I live in

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:46,590
Sapporo its town in North Penn but after

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,899
disappoint you I'm not a real samurai my

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,390
real name is Simon and I grew up in

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:57,320
Switzerland and as you can see we have

00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,320
very long weapons too

00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:08,130
okay so about that CSS somehow it seems

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,990
that people are very frustrated right

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:22,410
like really really frustrated so like we

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:28,050
see these kinds of tweets and it's by

00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:32,850
somebody's lesson here too

00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:35,750
so then if you search for CSS and if you

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,750
get this one

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:49,670
I want to seen it and another class you

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,670
wanna finish it

00:01:53,030 --> 00:02:00,840
okay loop so okay next so that's another

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,170
classic like you know forty four years

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,170
ago

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:14,870
yeah vertical centering and even if you

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,210
go on the website of Cisco when you

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:23,540
scroll all the way down I think I

00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:27,290
spotted some sub humor there so I yeah I

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:30,380
love those little details and so there's

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,710
no denying like this is not perfect and

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,290
I think probably never will be but

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:46,040
there's two things I will like about it

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:50,150
and one is it has simple syntax and I'm

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,350
totally not really into iris so we know

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:59,480
but I found this blog post and that's

00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:03,709
the core to draw in the border they call

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:08,450
it draw in the glow so yeah it's just

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:12,709
like a lot of lumps right and then if we

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:16,850
look at CSS it's just sweet single line

00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:19,310
and to be fair probably before I see

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:23,480
like you have a lot more low-level

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,489
control like you can maybe optimize for

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:31,190
performance and there's more features

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:36,200
but just the syntax I really like CSS is

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:39,820
done then the next thing I really like

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:44,360
is that CSS allows for instant changes

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:48,050
and you can just open the dev tools and

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,750
you can just change whatever you want to

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:53,540
right there and there's no like

00:03:50,750 --> 00:04:02,060
compiling there's no simulator to start

00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:03,799
so you can change the real thing and now

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,549
think about that and I don't know if you

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,910
make sense but maybe somehow we are like

00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:15,430
proper master so we can control and have

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,430
like in like real time

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:24,290
feedback and a direct connection to like

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:27,650
the dome so I want to explore a little

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:33,080
bit more and I made this totally fake

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:36,170
she has come fat and I wonder like if we

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,450
so this is looks pretty basic right so

00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:45,350
is there a way to kind of make this

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:49,130
easier to style and customize and I'm

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:53,830
gonna talk about two things so it's

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,830
going to be layout color and about size

00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:07,210
so lay out first so if we have a page

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,490
and we have text and with images and I

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,910
think it's okay if everything Scrolls

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:17,320
the whole page then we can use flow and

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:23,060
just wrapping and then for images we use

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:25,340
max with 1% it's kind of doable but only

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:30,020
trick is if we want to have a filled

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:33,710
page and this fixed elements like header

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:38,120
and footer and the space will always

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:40,220
fill up and kind of stretch the edges so

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,610
if you want to do it this layout I think

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:46,480
if you can I would use flexbox because

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:51,140
it's kind of the only way to have it

00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:54,590
like that and keep it very easy to kind

00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:57,020
of manipulate and I'm not gonna go too

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:02,780
much into flexbox but just like a little

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:04,640
bit so refresh once we set up flexbox we

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,720
have to basically decide what direction

00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:11,090
we want and by default it's always a row

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,930
so all the children go from left to

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:17,000
right but if we won't have from top down

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:22,250
we can have a flex directly to column

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,480
and then it goes top down and as you can

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:29,540
see now the footer is kind of stuck

00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,970
to the top so how can we make the center

00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,730
part kind of stretch out and push the

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:38,150
photo to the bottom so there's a run

00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:40,220
property called flex and if we turn it

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:44,650
to flex one then it just stretches

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:48,710
everything and foliage to the bottom

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:52,010
then if we add children in our case we

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,890
couldn't use allowing items and just by

00:06:52,010 --> 00:07:00,460
counting Center and basically everything

00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:03,350
the centers and yeah so that easy and

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:07,360
sometimes we want to also have stretched

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:10,580
children so for example a title or like

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,480
search feel or something and for that we

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:17,090
can use flex one two and then for the

00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,210
center part where we have many items we

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:23,290
want to have like they don't fit in the

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:28,340
space we have we can have wrapping and

00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:30,770
then it looks more like a great okay so

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,360
that's kind of it for layout we can see

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,360
it what we can do with this later

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:41,060
all right so about color so so layer I

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:46,160
just told everything so we can skip the

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:48,590
part not really but okay so I'm gonna

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,210
you this is a little small part that's

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,390
gonna be the same so but it's good

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:56,960
because then I don't have to explain it

00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:59,150
so I'm working on this you I set the

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,500
call digit and it's for the montage

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:05,780
framework and I don't know if you have

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:10,100
put forever suitor bachelor all those

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,620
it's kind of in that direction and here

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:16,190
you see it's the first version of a

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:20,600
couple components we made and it looks

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:23,000
very basic and kind of just gray and how

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,930
it's set up is that each component has

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,160
an own folder and each folder has the

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:34,760
CSS file JavaScript and HTML and this is

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,729
great because we can remove things we

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,349
can rename it we can add new ones and

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,770
stay all separated like we don't have to

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,070
worry

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:46,820
we can break something right so they're

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:50,029
kind of the own little world and once we

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:53,779
go to production we can run a script and

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:56,570
it combines it and mini files and it

00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:59,390
actually only includes what you use so

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,279
if you use just a single button doesn't

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:06,820
just include everything you just include

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:09,200
the code for the button and style too so

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,470
this is all great but it's like one

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,850
problem is that because it's all

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:21,230
separated if we look at the radio and

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:23,060
checkbox so it's basically almost

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,899
everything is the same except the icon

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,089
and the border-radius so if you want to

00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:32,870
change the color like the border color

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:35,870
what do we do but you know I could I

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,209
guess just have a huge list of selectors

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:42,160
and kind of override it like that

00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:45,170
or we can create a new class and we can

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,649
just put them all over the dome and in

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:53,050
the markup and yeah I guess probably the

00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:55,820
best is to use a preprocessor for that

00:09:53,050 --> 00:10:00,649
it's to anybody that doesn't want to use

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:05,950
preprocessor or it's not allowed to no

00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:10,490
party so everybody uses pre-processors

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:17,959
whoa all right

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:20,360
everyone can go home Chris all right

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:25,790
well let's see if it's still gonna be

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:30,649
interesting so anyways I was stalling

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:34,270
this input and I discover kind of by

00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:37,430
accident that if if you don't use a

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:41,000
border color it automatically picks up

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,220
the color right and yeah it said what

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,440
Leo told is like the current color right

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,260
but I didn't really know about it and

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,089
then I tweeted it and then Xavier was

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,420
like yeah of course that's how I always

00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,420
were

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:59,420
and yeah it turns out this book shadow

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:03,290
or in text shadow and outline the kind

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:09,350
of work the same and then Rodney wrote

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:12,320
tweet about the current color so yeah we

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:16,250
can use current color as a background

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:20,530
value and it's pretty awesome because

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,530
Mara we can see the text anymore

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:28,520
so so yeah like when ice kind of sorry I

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:33,110
was like okay so why didn't we know

00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:37,460
about this tree possibly be that this is

00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:41,960
just not useful and if we look at the

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:44,120
kind of a typical button so text color

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,810
is white right so there's nothing that

00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,250
is white

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,340
I mean there's a little bit highlight at

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:53,930
the top but it's transparent so it's

00:11:49,340 --> 00:12:01,520
really like kind of useless but then

00:11:53,930 --> 00:12:06,110
this happened so iOS 7 came and yeah

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:08,390
there's some buttons here and it didn't

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,750
take long and then kind of this style

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,390
didn't really take over the web but well

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,350
you can see a lot of this style now kind

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:22,460
of - and they all screenshots from

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:25,100
websites and okay so let's go back to

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,010
our components maybe we can use

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:34,340
something like that so then we create a

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:38,450
kind of like a modern version so how

00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:41,570
it's done it's like you set a color then

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:44,360
you have no back border color and the

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:48,710
background is transparent then we have

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,420
this kind of outline style and for

00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,640
example the slider look is kind of

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,300
similar except that it has a child

00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:59,390
element so we want to have the same

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:03,710
color for the thumb so we can use

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:09,560
current color and it picks up the same

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:14,840
as we define here so now if we open the

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:17,720
inspector and we test it so we can

00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:25,820
change the color and the whole component

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:28,010
changes not just like one part and we

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:32,030
don't have to keep it on the component

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:35,270
level we can kind of go kind of like the

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:43,820
Cascade this side so we have color

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:47,060
inherit and then if we go to the root we

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:54,890
can basically change all components with

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:57,770
just single property and if we don't use

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:03,350
a call at all it's a black as a default

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:05,510
and because we can use a cascade we can

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:10,450
also kind of limit it very worried right

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,450
like we can just change it wrong section

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:24,080
and we can also add backgrounds if you

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:25,700
want and change the color to white and

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,380
now you know this is like a problem

00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:35,180
because the I can hear is y2 and its SVG

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:38,770
but if we keep this fill kind of same as

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:43,700
the background then it works again and

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:48,800
if you are too lazy so remember the

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:51,980
alternative title you could also change

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:59,120
it to like this outline style where we

00:14:51,980 --> 00:15:01,760
have no background and we change the

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:07,730
fill to current color so now we are

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:09,880
basically again down to just one call to

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:14,690
change everything

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:20,590
all right so that's the cover so now we

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:24,110
go to size so if we look at this year

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:27,350
wouldn't it be nice if we could kind of

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:30,410
do the same with the belief collar also

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:42,430
have the size and there's something

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:46,970
similar anybody can guess yes so

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:52,670
basically where we can we use aims and

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:55,010
then saving with the collar we use

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,630
inherit so we can control it from any

00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:01,540
parent and sometimes we want to use

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:04,730
pixels like the border

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:09,140
so if we use pixel here then it always

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:14,900
stays one and doesn't change so in a

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:17,180
sense we don't define like a fixed size

00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:20,510
we basically just kind of describe the

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,650
proportions from like the height and

00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:30,440
kind of how much padding there is and

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:35,150
now when we go in and you can just so

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:38,210
six it is default so we can just kind of

00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:42,020
change everything at once kind of can go

00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:48,700
all the way down so it still works with

00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:52,460
two pixels it probably kind of too small

00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:55,280
and it's a one problem I don't know if

00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,860
you can see it so here you can see this

00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:02,450
one line is not even with the plus and

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:06,050
minus and the reason is I'm not sure but

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:09,950
I think that if we use an odd number

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:13,250
that the browser tries to snap to a

00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:15,740
whole pixel because he wants to draw

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:19,459
this line like sharp so then when it's

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,260
like 0.5 then sometimes you can't decide

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,070
if you should round up or down and then

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:27,030
you get this kind of

00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:29,970
which sometimes but if you stick to even

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:32,730
numbers you should be fine like I only

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:39,170
saw it before numbers so kind of just

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:41,520
keep that in mind so now what about REMS

00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,780
so at this point we could have used

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,220
worms because the only thing is

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:51,420
everydayness changed root element but if

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:55,320
you use REM c couldn't do this here so

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:59,960
you couldn't just select some element

00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,580
and then just change to children at once

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:07,320
so aims are just a little bit more

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:10,830
flexible in that way and there is a use

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:15,300
case for using REMS for example if you

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:19,820
want to get couple something from kind

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,820
of the size of the commode like marching

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:32,310
so we can change the spacing between and

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,780
we can change the component size kind of

00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:39,930
separate and yeah it's like nice to kind

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:45,300
of have two strings to kind of play if

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:49,380
that okay so I think the trading is

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:56,700
complete and now let's test this in our

00:18:49,380 --> 00:19:00,090
little app that have you made so if you

00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:05,030
wonder what this app does and not much

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:05,030
but you can search for the team

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:15,790
here they come and you can click them

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:23,680
and they start to wriggle and sorry if I

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:25,600
got personality wrong so yeah I know

00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,110
it's sort of it's silly but it should do

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:37,390
for our demo and by the way it's a fake

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:40,480
search so you can type anything ok so if

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:44,980
we set up the flex box that we saw

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:50,830
before now what it allows us to do is we

00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:54,130
can easily just reorder things so we can

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:58,480
grab the folder we can move it up and it

00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:00,880
just does all the calculations and kind

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,700
of like there's no hard-coded values

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,540
right the Flex looks kind of just does

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:11,140
all the mess for us and you can just you

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:14,440
know move things up it and just play

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:24,840
around till we think we found like the

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:24,840
right position and then sizing we can

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:34,360
play around with the size till we think

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:37,740
it's good so yeah you can limit it to

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,740
just the header if you want

00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:57,750
or play with spacing so now only Rams

00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,750
get changed

00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:13,130
and of course we can just change its a

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:14,870
single element or single Khopoli - this

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,850
is really handy because if your boss

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:20,600
comes in and says hey can you make the

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:22,480
logo bigger you can say yeah I can make

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:29,360
the logo bigger

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:31,610
so now let's test the color so again we

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,560
can just go into the route to be add a

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:38,690
color and we just black is the default

00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:49,900
and we can just play around till you're

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:49,900
happy then your different background

00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:02,759
we can whenever we want we can limit it

00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:11,009
to just a certain area so like which is

00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:13,199
a head white to have middle area and I

00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:17,249
think the contrast is a little bit low

00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:27,629
so how about we change it to an awesome

00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:32,029
fertilizer and the bars here we can also

00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:35,279
add a gradient and use curve color so

00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:37,859
the catch is kind of semi-transparent so

00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:43,769
now it looks a little bit like it's mask

00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:48,839
and at the bottom we can maybe add a

00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:51,889
dark one and if we won't have a

00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:57,449
different style and not just the outline

00:22:51,889 --> 00:23:00,239
up here you can just use backer inherit

00:22:57,449 --> 00:23:04,259
and color right and just maybe no poor

00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:07,379
you or something so now for example if

00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:10,079
we add a slider and you look up this

00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:15,569
value here so the slider only changes

00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:17,459
this year but because of inheriting in

00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:19,699
everything it just does everything at

00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:19,699
once

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:30,650
and there's maybe a couple more use

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:34,590
cases this is material coming like

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:37,680
ambient light so in dark areas like

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:40,890
ticket maybe change the whole UI to

00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:46,110
something dark right and you would have

00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:48,930
to do a lot of seeming to kind of do

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:51,180
that right but here to maybe just test

00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,970
out how I would look you can just have

00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,250
like no background dark and then color

00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:01,290
something right and you already done

00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:05,310
right and one more use cases are okay so

00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,820
if a user uploads maybe a an image or

00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,760
something

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,550
you can run script maybe detect the kind

00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:14,640
of domain color the dominant color and

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:17,130
maybe just adapt to that and have like

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,330
the whole user interface change to what

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:23,940
user uploads I think one case is like

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:30,570
iTunes changes the background depending

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:34,530
on the cover or the album so yeah okay

00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:38,730
so with this combo of flexbox can color

00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:40,110
Ames in like kind of a short time just

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,270
kind of feeling around we can kind of

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,780
create very a lot of different

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,780
variations

00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:56,170
and if you're wondering okay so we

00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:01,140
change this in the dev tools but of

00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,140
course if we refresh everything is lost

00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:08,190
so this a feature in chrome like the

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:15,929
workspace and what you can do you can

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:15,929
map the URL to the local file system so

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:28,630
you add the URL and then it just goes to

00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:33,660
the root of the folder I picked and then

00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:33,660
when we relaunch inspector

00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:50,840
so we can make a change and then we can

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:54,240
refresh it and it's saved and if we

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:58,560
select code editor you can see it

00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:04,410
updates and if you are thick stuff it

00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:06,150
just comments them out so yeah like if

00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,890
you heard that like the term like

00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:14,210
deciding in the browser that's kind of

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:17,250
literally designing the browser I can

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:21,900
feel him still feel an elephant in the

00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:24,990
room actually a couple so so I mean some

00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,750
probably say okay this is flat trend is

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:30,930
gonna be over soon and who doesn't use

00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:36,960
preprocessors yes I'm the only one well

00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:39,060
in this case and also CS variables are

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,760
coming right so is this the whole thing

00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:46,670
is this kind of practical or not right

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:49,020
and I think all this kind of is just

00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:52,530
argument against current cold I think

00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:57,780
flexbox and sizing I think it should be

00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:59,880
pretty useful so so yeah I agree like

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,100
the crinkle is a little bit between

00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,550
practical and Jennifer just kind of

00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:08,130
little bit head for fun but I still try

00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,350
to use it whenever I can and especially

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:14,040
when you start prototyping and

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:16,320
application and you you just gonna maybe

00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:21,120
play around and see how it looks I think

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:24,390
that's very easy and then also if you

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,630
have components that are very basic it's

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,960
much easier to add styles like shadows

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:33,570
and you know then actually have to

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,000
remove them or like overwrite them so I

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:42,480
think it's good as a starting point and

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,520
it checked out you at yesterday so it

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,110
actually uses aims and current color

00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:51,870
with preprocessor so it doesn't mean

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,210
that you can you know like it has to be

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:59,500
either or you can

00:27:53,210 --> 00:28:02,809
whenever you want but actually the real

00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,270
main point I want to make is the big

00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:09,770
picture

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:12,740
so this is quote so creators need an

00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:15,559
immediate connection and it's by Brett

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:20,210
Victor and his talk in Manteca on

00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:22,700
principle and he yeah like if you

00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:26,059
remember like the tree where he just

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:30,730
changes the code and it updates the

00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:33,320
tweet that's kind of the same and

00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,799
basically the examples I use it's more

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:40,820
about kind of currently for me that's

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:43,669
the closest I can get to that and I

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:46,640
guess it's a thing of like okay we had

00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:49,669
all those editing tools like Photoshop

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,549
or so and then we had code editor where

00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:55,399
we do everything by hand but there's not

00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:59,240
really much in between that's you see a

00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:02,090
little bit right but I think we should

00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,870
not stop and that's where we there

00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:12,080
should be something in between and we

00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:16,419
should improve a bit on that although

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,419
Scott is already very easy to please

00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,880
