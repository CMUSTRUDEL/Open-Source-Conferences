hi thanks everyone and thank you for you

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,610
know and thank you Nicole for that

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,800
fantastic our talked us then it really

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,920
got me thinking who are we actually here

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,139
and for me I feel like I'm here because

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm essentially standing on the

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,189
shoulders of so many fantastic designers

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,380
and developers who've come before me

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,560
when we part of such a an amazing

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,050
community who opened sourced their code

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,630
and and share with one another so I'm

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,910
really appreciative of everyone who put

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,170
this thing together today and if we

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,000
could just put our hands together for

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:48,120
the people who actually just put this on

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:50,760
once again so today I'm gonna be talking

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,090
to you about how you can bring elements

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,649
of surprise and delight to your projects

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,829
and to your websites and to do that

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:05,850
we're going to be using two technologies

00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:08,430
SVG and CSS and mainly the thing that

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,369
we're going to be doing today is really

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,619
talking about how you can use SVG today

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,000
how you can bring it into your projects

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,340
and just a short hands who's actually

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,280
using any form of SVG and a pro deck so

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,020
it's quite quite a lot of you and of you

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,170
how many of you are using inline SVG

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,860
your projects so it's a it's a much

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,780
smaller number that's good I'm hoping

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,250
that I can actually learn something from

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,350
you after I give you this talk because

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,020
I'm interested in in your perspectives

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,150
on how this works but I'm also hoping to

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,820
teach you a little bit and show you some

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,240
things that I've experienced I'm by no

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,460
means an expert in this but I've

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,680
experimented a lot with SVG and CSS so

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,770
hopefully I can give you something today

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,950
but what we won't be talking about its

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,110
frameworks and I'm not saying don't use

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,750
frameworks because the frameworks that

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,520
are there such as snap are fantastic and

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,240
I encourage you to explore explore them

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,640
but it's also important to I guess

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,200
understand what these frameworks are

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,610
doing for you so you can actually make

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,349
an informed decision of whether you

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,860
actually need them or not or whether you

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,270
might just

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,110
to put a little bit of JavaScript in

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,660
there to do what you need to do so today

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,690
we'll be exploring a few things we'll be

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,700
exploring why you'd want to use SVG and

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:31,160
CSS in your projects so we'll be

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:34,500
exploring some things like storytelling

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,450
we'll be talking about you know how you

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,940
can enhance storytelling with SVG and

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:44,520
CSS we'll also be talking about things

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:47,400
like lessons from the past and how we've

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,610
typically brought animation to the web

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,070
and what our attitudes were I mean we we

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,890
had flash a long time ago and we went

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,480
kind of bonkers with flash and and the

00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,370
attitudes that come out of us doing

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,610
things like that and how that harms both

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,060
the user and ourselves and we'll talk

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,310
about what's actually possible with SVG

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,590
and CSS and for the things that aren't

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,900
too possible maybe I'll show you some

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,650
fallbacks some ways in which we can deal

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,709
with with when when SVG and CSS don't

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,350
play so well together

00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:24,000
so to begin I'm going to talk about why

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,700
you'd want to use it and that's

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,140
essentially to enhance storytelling and

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,260
what I really mean is something that

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,030
Donald Norman really brought to me

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,040
brought to my attention in his book

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,280
emotional design is one thing that he

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,230
said was it's not enough that we build

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,780
products that function that are

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,209
understandable and usable we also need

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,630
to build products that bring joy and

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,830
excitement and essentially what we're

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,590
trying to do there is we're trying to

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,780
humanize the machine because we can

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,110
present data and content in a certain

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,549
way and it's usable and it's there but

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,610
we can also make it more lively and

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:08,430
exciting and so we see these examples on

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:10,829
the web of storytelling that enhance the

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:16,410
the content of the content and the

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:18,690
presentation of that content one example

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,510
I saw recently well in the last six

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,280
months was the polygon example the

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,320
surprise and delight in this and the

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,180
storytelling in this is a way of showing

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,720
the design

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,370
of the of the objects and it's not done

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,350
in a way in which it becomes annoying

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,940
and in your way it's something that you

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,169
could ignore if you didn't want it if

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,810
you didn't want to participate in it

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:40,580
it's something that adds value to what

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,220
you're looking at and so that's its way

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,220
of storytelling and then we have say SVG

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,580
and CSS and animation used together to

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,949
do things like use as activism so we've

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,139
got storytelling as activism and so

00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:55,880
you're going through and you're

00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:00,289
interacting with this experience that's

00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,419
showing you an important issue and who

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:05,229
has Fitbit here anyone anyone use a

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:07,430
Fitbit so it's a couple of you so

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:09,289
dashboards are a great example of

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,690
storytelling and a dashboard is showing

00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:14,419
you essentially the progress in which

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,070
you've made and in fitbit's example it's

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,419
what you've been doing that particular

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:22,300
week in that particular week I didn't do

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:30,020
a lot of exercise as you can see and

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:32,659
then you have these stories that the New

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,830
York Times has been presenting and the

00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:36,919
kind of story of the way they've been

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,690
enhancing their storytelling is really

00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,370
interesting and so they've they've in

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,010
this particular one they're going

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:47,389
through a journey and they're taking you

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:49,490
through the map of this journey from st.

00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,930
Petersburg to Moscow and they're sort of

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,870
plotting away the journey on the side

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:57,199
here to the left and they're using that

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,940
as a way to enhance and to sort of show

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,370
you along the way that these photos have

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,990
a context and it once again it doesn't

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,509
get in the way it's a way of just

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,740
enhancing something but when we talk

00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,830
about these things we need to think

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,349
about the past because our prevailing

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:16,610
attitude in the past was essentially

00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:19,479
this say bring flash and I made all the

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,300
things and so we really need to consider

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:25,520
the experience impact of our choices we

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,409
need to think about how what we do

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,030
affects the people who actually have to

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:31,130
use it not just having these

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:37,150
self-indulgent websites so where we can

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:39,460
do it just because we could do it and

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,729
how many of us experience

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,169
if you go to a website you look want to

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:46,240
read an article you want to find out a

00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:48,490
product and you're sitting there and

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,340
you're waiting websites some websites

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,530
still do this today and it's surprising

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,360
the people will make you will actually

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,220
believe that you're gonna sit there and

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,259
wait through these things it would have

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,849
to be pretty bloody good for me to want

00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:04,990
to wade through oh it's going in reverse

00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:07,360
it has to be pretty bloody good for me

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,220
to want to actually wait for some of

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,660
these things and so many times I've

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,900
abandoned websites for that exact reason

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,479
and the more modern problem I come

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,150
across these days is the scroll hijack

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,610
and it's more difficult for me to show

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,280
you on this slide but just say I wanted

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:26,080
to scroll really fast at the bottom it's

00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,910
not letting me it's taken over my

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,090
scrolling experience and I've got a

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:33,310
mental model of how a website Scrolls

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,050
and everyone has that mental model and

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,870
it's stealing that from me and it's

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,370
making me frustrated so we also have to

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,460
think about another thing the

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:45,060
performance impact of our choices and

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:48,720
there are websites all over the internet

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:52,930
Apple's a famous example of this where

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,090
they throwing 356 HTTP requests at you

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,580
and 25 Meg just to tell you about a

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,070
product I feel like it's a little bit

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:04,719
self-indulgent another website I came

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:08,440
across on sidebar one day had 200 Meg if

00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:10,300
I'd use my phone to this to use this my

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,110
foot that would be 1/5 of what my phone

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,270
is allowed to do each month so before we

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,130
talk about the techniques that I'm going

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,860
to show you I would just want to leave

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,680
you with the sort of do no harm because

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,659
it's not just doing no harm to the users

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,520
that are using our websites that are

00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:29,380
using these experiences but it's also

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,620
doing no harm to us because every time

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,169
we do do these things every time we take

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,120
over the experience or we put something

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:41,079
ahead of the thing that people actually

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,089
want we end up harming ourselves because

00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:45,040
people's attitudes towards having the

00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,839
animation in the website or having this

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,490
interesting visual component in the

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,670
website it starts to become negative

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,690
they start to associate it with ah we

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,879
don't want that we don't

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:59,139
and then you're gonna have a much harder

00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:02,019
time convincing people to allow that so

00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:04,269
in part three I'm going to let you in on

00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,850
a world of pleasure and pain and that

00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:10,000
world of pleasure and pain is SVG and

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:13,120
CSS implementation it is a road fraught

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,290
with danger but I will be telling you I

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,060
will be holding your hand along the way

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,889
and I will be telling you some ways

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,110
around some things and some of the ways

00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:22,329
of dealing with those things are going

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,759
to be a little bit crude but what I

00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:27,939
wanted to do today is to try and help

00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:29,709
you put CSS and SVG together and allow

00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:32,889
you to use say inline SVG in your

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:36,579
projects one of the great things about

00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:40,629
SVG it has a very similar mental model

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:44,829
to how you would do things today the CSS

00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:47,259
the styles that I would apply to SVG a

00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:51,069
very similar to the styles that I apply

00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:52,810
to HTML there's slight differences I

00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:55,060
mean instead of a border you might have

00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:59,079
a stroke and that stroke has a few more

00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:02,319
extra options that you can supply the

00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:06,250
style such as you can put these - arrays

00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:07,750
and - offsets you can put line joins and

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:12,130
you can control how the actual lines

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:15,670
hook up and the animation with keyframes

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,319
is essentially exactly the same but

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,480
there is all that markup and when you

00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:22,029
see a screen like this you open your

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,589
your your HTML file and you're using

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:25,360
inline SVG and you see something like

00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:29,410
this and it makes you not want to use it

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,790
because what is all that anyway I mean

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,709
there's probably a few people in this

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,649
room who actually know what the M and

00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:38,500
the Zed and all that mean but I expect

00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:41,589
not many people would but we can make it

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,720
more dry Oleg Salenko

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,819
had a great article in November last

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,879
year and he was talking about the idea

00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:51,459
of templating the SVG so what the idea

00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:55,720
over this is is you're actually setting

00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:57,399
a definition of what that object is and

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,880
then you're using it again later

00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,680
so as an example use your favorite

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,710
vector program whatever that is for me

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:10,030
it's illustrator because I'm old

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:13,340
here's a smiley face you then get it to

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:16,610
export that smiley face and as you see

00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,870
here we've got a definition that's the

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,220
code that would be exported for the

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,110
smiley face so it's not important what

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,400
the code is here just that it's within a

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,600
definition and that we've already

00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:29,300
templated what a smiley face is and all

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,220
we need to do is put this code in and

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,640
that will then reference that smiley

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,920
face

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:38,720
of course we've put that within an SVG

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:44,090
and then you have Cu smiley faces smiles

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:47,860
around now in theory SVG is accessible

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:50,990
in the spec it says you can put a title

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,560
you can put a description against things

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,990
and it will make it more accessible and

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,170
so you think okay I'll get my project

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,910
and I've got a bar chart and I'll put a

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:06,350
title in there and I'll describe what

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:12,980
it's actually doing and then I might put

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:17,750
a title on each bar in the bar chart it

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:23,110
seems easier right mmm it's not so easy

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:26,950
it's not so true at the moment the

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:29,660
accessibility of SVG isn't that great

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,250
unfortunately it feels good to put that

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,800
title and description in it feels like

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,830
you're doing more than an image alt tag

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,980
but the voice the voice screen readers

00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:43,490
don't really respect that so much and so

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,290
you might only find Firefox NVDA will

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,810
pick up some of the things like Aria

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,000
roles and it will work in Internet

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,970
Explorer but you won't find it working

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,270
so well with say voiceover for mac or

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,500
chrome box and I don't test with jaws

00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,410
because I don't have a whole lot of

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,960
money to buy jaws about all the other

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:06,320
voice programs that I use don't respect

00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:10,280
Aria roles so much so I have a for now

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,490
solution for that first thing you do

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,930
want to put an aria role on it as a good

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,100
practice that will say that it's an

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,230
image

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,570
and you want to label it by title and

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,420
description so Firefox and Internet

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:26,660
Explorer in NVDA will actually respect

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,730
it and for all the other browsers I'll

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,140
actually put something on a wrapper that

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,800
just says what it is a graphical

00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:36,890
representation of a donation spend there

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:40,130
is some hope with accessibility in SVG

00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:43,490
and that is with SVG too and we'll have

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:48,910
better tabindex support and we'll have

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:52,970
better Aria levels SVG is also

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:56,600
responsive and there's two ways in which

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:59,630
you can approach it being responsive the

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,440
first is the proportional way so I can

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:05,660
grab this and I can just make it switch

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,400
at different break points and for this

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,710
example I'm just I'm just throwing in a

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,890
few devices that I've made with SVG and

00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,990
that it can switch really easily and

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:19,430
what this way will do is this way will

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:23,240
actually scale the object and just like

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:24,980
before a media query of an SVG is

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,090
essentially the same as what you're used

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:32,810
to an idea within the elements so that's

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:34,550
that's a different discussion there's

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,460
also something in SVG called view box

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,470
and you'll find that view box is a

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,120
little confusing and really view box

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,700
the important thing is that the first

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,010
two numbers are just a coordinate of X

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,960
and y so where it is on the XY plane and

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,000
the second three numbers are actually a

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,280
way in which it can tell what the

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,080
proportion of the stuff within it is so

00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,390
having a higher number will mean that

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,280
it's actually much smaller and having a

00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,350
lower number would mean that it's much

00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,440
wider there's also one other thing that

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,000
you need to know about with view box and

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,310
that's something called preserve aspect

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,200
ratio and all that is doing is it's

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,780
telling you where to scale from so if

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,670
you use something like X mid that means

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,920
that it scales from the middle of the X

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,860
plane and if you use Y min that means

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,220
it's scaling from the top now you'll

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,830
find when you're working with SVG you'll

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,570
have a little problem in Firefox you'll

00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,150
see that all the other browsers will be

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,600
quite fine with you having this SVG and

00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,910
and

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,399
show you the whole SVG the Firefox will

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,949
cut it off for some reason but before

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,569
you get mad at Firefox for doing it it's

00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:39,459
actually doing what the spec says it

00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:42,139
should be doing

00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:44,000
it's supposed to be overflow:hidden by

00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,529
default it's just that the other

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,930
browsers don't listen to that for some

00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:50,630
reason so to deal with that you just

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,240
need to put overflow:visible on that um

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:56,959
SVG element and so you'll get something

00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:01,220
fixed now the other way in which I would

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,769
do responsive with SVG is I would have a

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,420
fixed element and so when you have a

00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,399
fixed element it doesn't scale

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,560
proportionally but it changes with the

00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,970
media query an example of when you would

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,380
use that with something like a donut

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,750
chart and if you could imagine I had

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,310
some text to the side of that and I then

00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:21,319
wanted that text to then be at the

00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:24,829
bottom SVG is relatively device and

00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:29,050
browser friendly but we've had some slow

00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:32,149
implementation if you look at can I use

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:40,189
you'll see no internet explorer 8 below

00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:41,540
no Android 2 with SMI L which is one of

00:16:40,189 --> 00:16:45,439
the things that you really want to do

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:49,009
with with SVG unfortunately no internet

00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:52,790
explorer at all so all those really

00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,930
interesting things inside SVG you that's

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,139
when you'll probably want to use a

00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:59,839
framework so just to quickly recap if

00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:03,199
you want to use SVG at all no Android to

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,819
knowing and Explorer eight and blue so

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,319
I've got some fallbacks which will make

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:12,730
you feel kind of dirty so one is using

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:16,579
moderniser to check for inline SVG and

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:18,289
if there's no SVG I'll simply replace it

00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:22,789
with a background like it was if it was

00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:24,559
a background SVG and the code sample of

00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:25,039
code without is just simply looking for

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,250
the feature

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,020
moderniser will chuck the check the

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,500
class on there and then I'll give it a a

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,270
PNG now there's a number of issues with

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,200
SVG animation that you need to be aware

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:42,380
of and just as an example I was messing

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,600
around with a hamburger style menu

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:49,520
and I came to the realization while I

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,980
was doing that that chrome so for this

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,950
example it's a scaling one ear out and

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,410
one in and in chrome it does exactly as

00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:00,559
I told it to do when I hover it

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:03,710
I want the hamburger to go down and I

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,539
want the X to come up and you think yep

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,750
that's fine Safari it's fine

00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:11,210
going into Firefox and you have a slight

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,700
issue Firefox won't accept transform

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,440
center center or any kind of word base

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,830
to transform and it won't allow you to

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,780
put percentages in Firefox will always

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,000
anchor to the top left which is really

00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,610
really bad for animation because you

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,740
want to be able to control that and in

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,100
ia it doesn't even accept transform at

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:33,770
all and as you can see I don't even get

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,539
three bars out of that and the only

00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,309
thing you can actually animate in

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,350
Internet Explorer even up to Internet

00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:42,409
Explorer 11 as far as I know he's a

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,870
pasady so I've got a little bit of a

00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:49,520
workaround

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:53,270
this is Internet Explorer 10 I managed

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,250
to get the SVG to animate can anyone

00:18:53,270 --> 00:19:04,370
guess as to how I might have done that

00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:11,360
yep very close okay so I'll just quickly

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:14,990
go through so I so you said

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:19,210
you transform the wrapper okay yes

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:22,190
that's very very close as pretty much it

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,140
so you go any favorite graphics program

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,470
and you make to be a pattern thing that

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:31,039
you're gonna animate and then you make

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,539
your path which comes out of it and you

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,070
put that within a definition and that's

00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:39,789
a template and that thing is its own SVG

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:43,070
you then make a stage with the wrapper

00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:44,600
and and then you set the limits to that

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,220
wrapper so you're telling it that it

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,540
can't be outside of a certain area and

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,950
then you put those objects on the stage

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,409
using that templating thing that we

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,270
talked about before except in this case

00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:59,900
we're using small SVG

00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:03,410
and we're referencing the other svj and

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,940
so now we've got two waves you might not

00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,190
be able to see it because I have a wall

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,290
of code here but in the view box have

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,240
actually adjusted the first two numbers

00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:15,679
and that's just so that they can layer

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:19,220
over each other so just to quickly recap

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,900
we have our wrapper we then put our

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,880
stage and that stage is deliberately

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,190
outside of the wrapper and because for

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,100
some reason Chrome and Safari don't like

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,960
to respect the boundaries that we've

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,750
actually set you actually have to bleed

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,880
it out of it a little bit which is

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,740
hacking burst I know but it's a

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,590
workaround and then you layer all three

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,990
SVG's on top of each other and then you

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,510
can just use a position:absolute and

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:47,150
then you can transform each of those

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,490
elements as though using normal CSS

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:52,010
animation so you're not relying on the

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,960
implementation of CSS and animation with

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,890
in SVG you're actually relying on the

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,780
standard implementation of CSS animation

00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,160
and of course you want to find put a

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,250
common class and like I said

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:08,420
position:absolute on the layer and we've

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:12,080
got going outside of that boundary and

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:15,140
your style each wave and put an

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:20,690
animation on each layer or wave and then

00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:23,150
once again you have your animation so

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,770
SVG is fairly designer friendly and as I

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,600
explained before you can just go in

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:30,980
whatever vector program you like and

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,140
export crazy robots you can do complex

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:38,809
shapes so it's great for doing things

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:41,360
like type lookups and sort of line sort

00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:43,220
of things and shapes that you can layer

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,480
on top of each other and use various

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,790
opacity that you wouldn't normally be

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,670
able to do with CSS and it's great for

00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:51,530
data visualization and so you can have

00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,640
all the infographic stuff so those

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,230
people that foam in the mouth of

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,910
infographics and the great thing about

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,520
it is that you can then interact with

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:02,120
that stuff programmatically but you

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:04,400
can't interact with an SVG as image on

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,559
the page as far as I know other than

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,240
actually moving that around using

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,340
traditional animation

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,370
and you can't really interact with the

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:15,500
background image in the same way SVG SVG

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,570
has some pretty promising features and

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,650
one of my favorites is actually clipping

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:24,080
and masking so just to quickly explain

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,460
what clipping and masking is to show

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,080
those of you who might not know what

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,820
that is is first we have a hexagon and

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,730
then we want to put a clip path over the

00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,110
top of that X hexagon and what that clip

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,330
path is essentially doing it's saying

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,520
that this hexagon can only exist within

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,080
that clip path will actually exist out

00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,610
of it but you can only be seen within

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:52,280
that clip path and then finally that

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:55,340
clip path will then be shown within that

00:22:52,280 --> 00:23:00,050
boundary and I made a little example of

00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:02,570
a tree using that that grows it's just a

00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:06,260
quick example of the tree trunk growing

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,910
up using something like that and all

00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,400
that is doing is animating the clip path

00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,230
up so it doesn't all just scale up in a

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,970
really weird way and I'll show you what

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,660
it looks like without the clip path with

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:20,000
the cliff path behind it

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:23,780
okay first yeah we put the example clip

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,250
path in and then we then we apply the

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,340
style of the clip path to that

00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:32,300
particular graphical element here's the

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,470
example I was mentioning before this is

00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:39,470
what it would look like without the clip

00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:41,060
path as you can see it scales up in a

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,530
really weird way and then you see this

00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,490
big purple thing that big purple thing

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,660
is the shape that I'm essentially

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:51,080
animating behind it so SVG also has

00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,240
really interesting filters an example of

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,220
how not to do the filters don't go into

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,810
something like illustrator and add drop

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,790
shadow because then you'll end up with

00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,650
something that looks a bit like this and

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,780
you don't really want something like

00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,060
this in your code it looks kind of gross

00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,130
and the reason why not only is this kind

00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,530
of gross is this is actually rasterized

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,260
so this is actually removing the benefit

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:15,500
of having a vector vector format in your

00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:18,680
code because it's chucking this huge lot

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,890
of rasterize stuff into your actual

00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,240
shell

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,070
to give you example of a complex crop

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,540
job shadow I had to make this a really

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,640
ugly drop shadow for this presentation

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:31,270
by the way I'm not saying this is how

00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,740
you should do drop to this is you can

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,290
actually put these drop shadows on these

00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:39,190
complex items which you couldn't really

00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:42,400
do with box shadow box shadow would just

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,930
put a shadow around the box so to give

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,760
you a quick example of how you would do

00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,950
that is once again you use those

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,630
definitions that we talked about so the

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,130
great thing about SVG is that a little

00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:54,640
templating thing you can put things in

00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:57,520
deaths and they won't render out unless

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,910
you're actually using them so in this

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,190
one we put a little Gaussian blur on the

00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:06,190
on the drop shadow and you can change

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:09,100
that standard deviation number and

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:11,470
that'll let you actually change the

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,420
strength of that drop shadow and then

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,590
you'd set sort of an offset blur and

00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,440
that would tell you how far it is from

00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,900
there and then the rest of the stuff

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,679
there is just the extra implementation

00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,480
of that and you can do things like you

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,890
can put noise I'm not sure if I can

00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,630
actually you can actually see that from

00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,059
where you are but you can put noise over

00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:33,850
the top of things like a gradient to do

00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:35,740
that you'd use a noise filter and that

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:39,130
would then filter over red green and

00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:41,230
blue and then you'd be saturate it so it

00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,929
doesn't affect the colors of what you're

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,670
actually using and then you just put

00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:49,059
that over the top of an actual gradient

00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:51,790
and you make that sort of opaque my

00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:54,100
favorite thing in SVG is type along a

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,900
path and we have all these examples of

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,050
the web of art Direction cases where

00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:02,410
people use curve to type in an

00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:05,040
interesting way and something I really

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:08,050
wish we could just do with HTML and CSS

00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,630
but to do it with HTML and CSS it's a

00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:12,940
bit of a dark art it's sad yeah it's the

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,300
dark art of curve type say someone might

00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,220
approach it like this they might put

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,809
span around every single letter and then

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,559
position every single letter out in a

00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:24,340
way in which that could have that effect

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,470
or you might use something like

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:30,760
lettering Jay yes which essentially does

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:32,940
the same thing how to create that in SVG

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,520
once again we use that death

00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,950
thing which is pretty pretty handy and

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,930
that path there is essentially this I

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,800
got a semi circuit circle I cut it in

00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:46,170
half and then I explored the path to

00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,420
actually have that text I get to put the

00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,550
word in that I actually put in so it

00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,370
makes it a lot easier to work with and

00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,530
that's now referencing the X link there

00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,720
in the middle is referencing that text

00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,490
shape which is the curve and then I'm

00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,580
giving it an offset I'm telling it to go

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:04,800
start halfway through that shape I'm

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,390
then telling it to anchor from the

00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,060
middle so the text will actually flow

00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:11,340
out from that middle area you'll end up

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:14,160
with something like that so it's text

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,800
over a curve and you think fantastic

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,220
except then five hooks comes along and

00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:24,780
it looks like it looks like a car hitter

00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:30,210
and of course you respond accordingly to

00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:31,740
that and you want to hook smash so bill

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,480
less-than-ideal workaround for dealing

00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,000
with this and I have actually managed to

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,170
work with a few paths and I haven't

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,150
quite figured out what the actual

00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,590
pattern is that sometimes it doesn't do

00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,590
that in Firefox but it seems the problem

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,930
is to do with the offset so in this

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,970
particular example I found an offset

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,650
percentage which didn't make the text

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,900
look like it had been hit by a truck and

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:55,350
here's where the really ugly solution

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:59,370
comes in I then transform the entire SVG

00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:01,620
object to to be rotated in a way in

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,960
which I can then get a fairly consistent

00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,730
experience for the curve and it's not

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,330
quite exactly the same as how I'd done

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:10,860
it but it still it still looks

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:13,590
moderately how I want it to look so

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,260
let's talk about lion animation and you

00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:18,810
as I showed you the polygon example

00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,340
earlier I was really impressed by that

00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,050
and I'm not saying that you should all

00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,340
just suddenly put line animations on

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,350
your website but I just wanted to talk

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:29,700
about how actually how easily that

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:32,670
implementation is so start with

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,440
something like a microphone and you've

00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:37,080
got this thick outer line you've got

00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,090
thin thin lines inside it and you export

00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,410
that into parts I'm not going to show

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,300
you all the paths because there's a

00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:45,120
quite a few of them but what I did

00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,740
through this is I found common paths so

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,480
I found that inside there's a

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,580
there's the skinny line on the outside

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,700
it's got a thick line and it's got some

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:56,340
blocks of color the key to the animation

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:59,399
is actually with that stroke - offset I

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,600
said earlier and Stroke - array now I'll

00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:01,470
just quickly explain what they actually

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,740
are

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:08,039
- array essentially says with the first

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,140
number I'm the - so that's a hundred

00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:13,890
pixels wide and then the second number

00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:16,740
is I'm the gap in the - and so that one

00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,029
might be 200 pixels wide and - offset

00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,330
actually tells it when the pattern

00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:24,330
begins so if I made a 500 it would start

00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:28,049
beginning at 500 and when we animate in

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:30,539
this example for the microphone I made

00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:34,620
at 2,000 pixels and then I animate that

00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:36,929
2,000 pixels down to zero and then we

00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:42,750
get something when this actually loads

00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:44,640
the page that draws the animation onto

00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:49,080
there and then I just fade in the rest

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,510
of the elements so what I want you to

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,559
think take from this and think about is

00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:56,789
how you can use SVG and once again the

00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,770
frameworks that are there are fantastic

00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:01,200
and I think you should explore them but

00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:04,130
it's definitely worth exploring what you

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,090
can do with SVG today because it's a

00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,909
surprising amount that you can actually

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,260
do and it's a way of enhancing things on

00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:12,210
your in your projects and a way of

00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,159
enhancing storytelling in your projects

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,950
because you can do things like animate

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,140
complex shapes you can add curves you

00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:21,600
can add all these little effects that

00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:25,919
don't necessarily intrude on the

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,760
experience but enhance the experience so

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,760
