well hello everyone thank you for being

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:09,330
here I'm here to talk about Newton a

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,550
little bit and there's a thing with my

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,590
name which is way too long is Maria

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,830
Maddalena Ferreira you can just call me

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,199
ever Eva or Fr because it's too

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,750
complicated for non spanish-speaking

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,180
people to pronounce oven cleaner in fact

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,810
and I'm not usually cold like that only

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:32,850
my mother when she smiled at me so it

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,880
was ok Eva don't worry as they say I'm

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,309
what designer and I mostly teach at the

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,170
University and I do some web marketing

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,800
stuff like Facebook and AdWords

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:47,190
campaigns I guess you wonder this talk

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,289
is about timing functions that hopefully

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,690
will be useful to you not only what

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,070
design but also in any kind of animation

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:59,520
you make like a stop motions or an

00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:01,980
animated movie these are the available

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,979
timing functions in CSS with all the

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,100
steps linear is seen is out is in out on

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,880
the receiver i reorganize this an

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,150
uncreated two groups which are steps on

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,000
all the rest now a steps is way too

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,700
different to the others so first of all

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,990
we look at steps and then we'll look at

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,090
all the way circles with physics here's

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,640
a little eating area first of all we

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,850
talked about animation how dust frames

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,880
work with them and key frames then about

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,270
steps and then about physics there will

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,329
be a little bit of math in there but not

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:46,890
many I promise I so after all you get

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:49,860
lunch happy well as we can talking about

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,979
animation animation is a time-based form

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,250
of art lips means we get movement

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:59,009
through time and in this case we work

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,189
with frames working with friends at the

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,590
beginning can be a little bit confusing

00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:06,689
every frame is part of an animation we

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,300
get a 10 seconds animation and we divide

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,160
it in part on each part is a new frame

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,060
for example

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,960
we got in here eight frames and each

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,660
frames lost the same quantity of seconds

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,160
and then we also got key frames which

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,290
are the most important parts of the

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,780
animation where we provide a major

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,960
changes like we go from this color to

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,800
the other so in this case look at this

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,830
which is pretty boring but the important

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,680
thing is that we have Noah salivation we

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:44,070
have a linear easing and we can check

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,840
that because we have these middle frames

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:51,840
with the same width in this case we have

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,070
the same animation but the inside

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,340
friends are different they have the same

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:02,070
duration as this one that means if this

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,070
one last one second this one that does

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,440
one second as well but it will cover

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,860
more distance than this one here and

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,440
this one which is a smaller will cover

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,900
less distance in the same quantity of

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,530
time and this one so we get an

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,050
acceleration that we didn't have before

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:26,280
in here the frames and they're smaller

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:29,280
that means that they are slow blur and

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,400
here they are bigger so the animation

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,260
goes faster so that disposal of middle

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,900
friends indicates the rhythm of the

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,410
animation and with it was we know as

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,170
timing functions in CSS we got the

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,209
keyframes property and first of all we

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,400
must create the animation we provide

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,550
only the keyframes and then we apply to

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,590
the element indicating the duration the

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,770
iteration count how many times we wanted

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,780
to repeat direction Phil modes it means

00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,450
what happens when this animation ends

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,150
and the play states whether post or

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:07,470
running and then of course a timing

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:10,560
functions for example we got this

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,080
animation called name and we got two

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,620
keyframes from and in this case we are

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,060
simply changing colors now here's the

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,950
example of course harry potter and

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,490
we got Harry Potter's invisibility cloak

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:27,860
and we want to make it invisible so the

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:32,000
animation is called invisible and it

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:36,700
goes from opacity 12 opacity 0 now we

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,760
apply it like this to cloak invisible

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:46,190
two seconds so we can play it infinite

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,010
which isn't really what we wanted or we

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:52,280
can play it only once until it to

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:55,430
display in the last keyframe that

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,330
happens when we apply the film mode in

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:02,090
this case for words so the animation

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:06,050
when it finish goes back to the last key

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:09,050
frames which is two opposite easier the

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:14,570
other hand or the other side of forwards

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,670
is backwards which stays in the first

00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:20,570
keyframe that's why it goes back to

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:22,900
opacity one so besides that we can have

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:28,520
many more keyframes as many as we want

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:30,830
with percentages like here and again we

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,220
can play with harry potter go into a

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,560
party now his cloak will change in this

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,890
case it will change colors because it's

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,100
magical and all that so we have many key

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:46,330
frames from and to actually from and two

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:50,180
can be using percentages as well like

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:55,250
zero percent and a hundred here and it

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:57,440
will work the same way hundred there so

00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:01,370
we could Harry Potter going to a party

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,040
of course field shiny and color changing

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,290
clothes and you can make it faster or

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:12,110
slower however you want and usually

00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,730
infinite or less repeats so those are

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,160
the basics of animation in case you

00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:19,280
weren't familiar with it now let's go to

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,790
timing functions so we start we have

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,030
steps on the rest let's take a look at

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:29,450
the steps first because it is the most

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:32,030
different of all now the steps function

00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:35,840
divides the animation in this case we

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:40,760
got this green thing that turns around

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:43,430
forever and we got a linear thing that

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:47,150
means he has no acceleration the default

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:49,700
option is in is if that means that it

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:53,360
goes like this but we're going to apply

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,810
steps so steps is another time in

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,540
function that requires a number between

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,640
parentheses the number will be the

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,630
quantity of frames this animation will

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:08,540
be divided for example 10 and we with

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:11,720
here is the whole animation divided in

00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,850
10 if this number is figure then we get

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,140
an amorous smoother animation and if

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:21,830
this number is smaller we get a less

00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:24,860
smooth animation now we can apply this

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,720
to what design and to use it again

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,110
something that you might be familiar

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,350
with it's called chrono photography

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:37,120
which were the beginning the beginnings

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:40,640
of animations back in the 19th century

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,090
so and 20 mission pioneers well she's

00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,980
Mary and everyone my bridge that shows

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,530
Mary is known for researching body

00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,320
motion and he used to take this kind of

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,020
pictures where he had and people dressed

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,180
in white running on champagne in a black

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,490
background and what's interesting about

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,460
this is that he created this idea of

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:04,280
frames of dividing a movement in

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,100
different parts he took a lot of

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,550
pictures in this case of affairs as well

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,910
and then came at hermitage who's known

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,650
for the steps function and the gift

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:19,940
animations even though he was like in

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:23,210
1903 something like that so his most

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:28,580
famous photograph is this one and this

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:31,220
picture has a story the horse rider

00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,620
wanted to know his horse didn't touch

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,080
the ground at any time during the race

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:40,190
so he hired this guy to take a lot of

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,589
pictures of he shows and they they check

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,219
that of course that he didn't the court

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:48,569
didn't touch on the ground

00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:50,910
some part of the right and the the

00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:53,100
writer was so happy that he hired this

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,129
guy to take a lot of pictures a day he

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,560
took like thousand pictures a day and he

00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:00,750
discovered that he puts all these images

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,930
together one before the other he got

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:07,050
this which is what we nowadays known as

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:12,439
a gif animations and where the basics of

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:15,480
and an animation and key frames and

00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:19,199
thousand pictures a day of cats dogs

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,959
everything he could think of and then we

00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:24,870
got our example how do we apply this to

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:28,379
web design with a steps function in this

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:32,269
case we got and images of the Guru of a

00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:34,649
kangaroo champagne we have 12 images and

00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:39,959
first we should put although she musta

00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:42,509
together in one is one image with five

00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:47,670
thousand pixels to I 400 pixels high and

00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:50,180
each single image measures for 5,300 so

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:53,250
that's most important to make this work

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:57,059
that we get the example will we got the

00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:01,139
animation only from unto and as you can

00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:04,410
see we get the element with a background

00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:07,290
image which is the whole long five

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:11,490
thousand pixels image and a little

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:13,800
window of 550 300 which is only one

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,379
image shall we get to see only one only

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,449
the first and the animation will be

00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:26,160
applied to the background position of

00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:34,680
this image it will go from 0 0 which is

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:39,720
the default position to five thousand

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:43,529
pixels 0 okay it won't move up and down

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:48,019
you will only move from right to left so

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:52,110
we can apply this over here animation

00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:55,290
all that two seconds now if we play it

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,839
infinite which I

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,990
this is not what we wanted this doesn't

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,350
really look like a kangaroo champion so

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:07,800
first of all let's really check and

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:11,519
what's going on the background is moving

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,649
okay is going through from zero to 5,000

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,670
now what we should do this device

00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:19,860
animation import with steps and the

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,199
number of parts will be equal to the

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,949
quantity of frames we got in this case

00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:28,350
we got 12 little pictures so this

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:30,449
doesn't really look really ette it looks

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,930
like a little fake besides it's a draw

00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:38,759
and not a real kangaroo and so that is

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:41,759
because M we have 12 frames in two

00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,920
seconds and our minds need at least 10

00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:48,300
frames per second to make it look real

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,250
so we should have a leash a duration of

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,740
one second to make it look a smoother

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:56,850
and more real because our mind needs

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,529
that if we make it faster then it looks

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,560
horrible this look at the Congress on

00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:04,970
drugs so if you don't have enough

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,490
keyframes try to and throw more

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:12,389
kangaroos or simply improved and one

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:14,730
second so yeah and at least ten frames

00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:18,839
per second to the mind to be able to

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:21,839
catch the animation now and timing

00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,850
functions especially your steps I always

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,730
see them in animation announcing

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,709
transitions but actually and the tiny

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,050
main functions will only the transition

00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:34,199
twerking graph so they can totally be

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:37,709
using transitions as well so the very

00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:43,620
same stunt example with with a cover we

00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:47,449
change again the back ground position to

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:53,630
five thousand pixels syrup and we apply

00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:58,649
the transition over here which is all to

00:12:53,630 --> 00:13:01,170
one second now it looks like this again

00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:04,350
so we must apply the steps function and

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:08,380
it will be 12 keyframes because we got

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:11,240
12 over here right now

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,910
so it works on cover as well because

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,790
steps is timing function and it works in

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,520
cover and it's a transition as well so

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,910
we know where and why should I use a

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,090
stepson not a gift first of all I get

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,690
more colors I get a word a better way to

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:33,070
handle opacity give opacity is only 0 or

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:36,680
1 it doesn't have anything in the middle

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:40,580
sorry ever get better gradients as well

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,410
only know we get better quality but we

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,600
have to put the images together and if

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,760
we have like two thousand images that

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,830
can be a pain in the ass but well

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:54,770
usually we have like 10 20 no 200 well

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:57,320
what about then the rest besides the

00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:00,830
steps we got all the way circle and here

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:04,040
we got the physics so the VC group has

00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:08,450
some predefined functions and then we

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:12,080
got the whole war of the girl so it's

00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:14,330
usually progress over time we you might

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,650
know something like this it's Valley

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:23,030
avelos website quick decir con we will

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:25,220
take a look at this for physics ok so to

00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,020
begin with we'll be talking about faces

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,530
of motion we won't be talking about

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,440
yamanami or something more complicated

00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:37,220
only a few basic concepts and Frank

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,050
Galileo and Newton now those are SP

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,080
deceleration gravity acceleration and

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,700
free fall first of all the speed is the

00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,210
rate of change in an object's position

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,310
in which it covers distance is what we

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:53,060
usually know as 20 kilometers per hour

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:56,450
12 miles per hour or meters per second

00:14:53,060 --> 00:15:00,290
it's always length divided by time now

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:02,420
there's a an invented totally invented

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,290
story let's pretend i only took one

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,290
flight to get here

00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:11,160
the distance from when aside us to

00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:15,180
Melbourne is 11,000 kilometers on boys

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,890
come flights up to 950 that means the

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:22,770
flight you had taken less than 12 hours

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:24,390
but it took like 14 so the speed should

00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,370
have been seven hundred and ninety

00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,340
kilometers because we are actually

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,930
looking always at a bailar she's the

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,940
plane doesn't go all the time in a

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,820
hundred fifty goes from zero to nine

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:39,330
hundred to 800 it goes up and down and

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,150
thus the average so that takes us to a

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:46,560
generation how an object goes from zero

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:49,380
to 950 and in this case again Harry

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:53,190
Potter if this car goes from King cross

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:56,400
two cars in four seconds and it eats at

00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:59,910
speed goes from zero to 350 meters per

00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:03,570
second then what is its acceleration

00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:06,150
well we have this month to get to know

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:09,930
it which is changing a speedy by the

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,790
time interval if we go from zero to 10

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,890
meters per second then the change if the

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,770
meters per second in one second we get

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:19,770
10 meters per second square as our

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:23,040
acceleration in the previous example of

00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:25,730
the car we call 350 meters per second in

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,970
four seconds so the acceleration is 80

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:33,750
7.5 meters per second square now this

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:37,170
takes us to gravity gravity iron

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:39,720
freefall now we know that every time

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,390
something drops it falls down because

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:48,480
it's attracted by gravity now gravity of

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:50,580
Earth is known as she and it's 10 meters

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,730
per second square that means that every

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,640
second force is a salad ation will be 10

00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:01,830
meters per second so that Allah is

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:05,510
actually 9.80 6 is 5 for the sake of our

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:09,870
minds will check 10 and so we get this

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:13,350
this table which shows how the speed

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:15,270
increases over time if we consider

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,550
gravity acceleration if we let something

00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,480
drop for two seconds it's a speed will

00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:23,079
be 20 if well as something

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:28,360
45 speed will be 50 now the expert in a

00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:30,340
chart will give us this now we might

00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,070
confuse this with the linear

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,900
acceleration but we must be reminded in

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,690
here we're talking about the speed and

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,880
hear about programs and they are not the

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,790
same thing because we want to actually

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,220
look at the distance cover and thus it's

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,850
a progress so if I let something drop

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:51,820
for three seconds will fall 30 meters

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:54,130
the answer is no it will fall 45 meters

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,040
because it is accelerating so it will

00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:00,700
cover more distance and now this is

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,360
horrible but the thing is to know the

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:08,559
distance covered in gravity we have a

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:13,330
half times g times x square now that

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:15,549
math in three seconds will give us 45

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,850
meters ok you don't have to know this

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:22,840
and what you actually have to understand

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,669
is that the speed increases all the time

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,370
and that means that the distance tests

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:29,169
as well so for example if we let

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:33,850
something drop for five seconds we get

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:37,150
25 times 5 125 and that's easier to

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:41,049
understand and we get this new child now

00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:43,630
this charge talks about distance in time

00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:48,299
and that's what we know as progress in

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:53,380
time so as you can see it increases ok

00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:57,160
so this is what we know as the is in

00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:01,720
quick receiver function as triangles

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:04,559
while it goes faster so what about free

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:08,799
fall now we got a little story about

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:11,290
Galileo throwing two things of the pizza

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,540
where you might have heard of it in this

00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:17,549
case he threw a watermelon and a pixel

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:21,610
why not and after he wanted to know

00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:23,980
which one was first and what do you

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,020
think was the pics offers the watermelon

00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:30,610
or both at the same time good thing is a

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,810
pixel well who wants pizza closing with

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,170
a watermelon

00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:38,180
okay couple of people don't be afraid

00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:41,360
everything was at the same time okay

00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:45,380
buddy a lot well joe kelly leigh about

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,750
things fell at the same time but then

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,450
came newton and he say hey and maybe

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,490
don't fall at the same time so he

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:56,180
thought that they needed a higher place

00:19:52,490 --> 00:20:00,050
and this fireplace was of course the

00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:04,190
Burj Khalifa sonido went to the Burj

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:08,050
Khalifa I history of course I what sir

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:11,330
pizza you can totally picture this and

00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:14,960
actually what happened was incredible

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:18,260
the watermelon was first so this is only

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,880
live be concerned you don't never went

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,040
to the Burj Khalifa and start throwing

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,890
things the reality is that Newton

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,830
actually never researched the exact same

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,530
thing as Galileo with things volume

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,630
first and last but this takes us to

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,510
another story with ease and the elephant

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,580
on the feather and if an elephant and a

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,530
further fall from the same place at the

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,410
same time then the elephant will be

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,510
first and that's because we are talking

00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,030
about air resistance and first and

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,580
second Newton's law on terminal velocity

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,710
only known when we on what we want to

00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:55,820
understand is that an option

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:58,430
free-falling will accelerate but due to

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,910
a resistance it will eventually cease to

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:03,500
accelerate and reach terminal velocity

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,740
okay and the further village that

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,280
velocity first because of the shape and

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:14,300
its mass so let's apply the all these

00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:17,360
horrible stuffs to win design again and

00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,790
we have this again remember this we got

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,790
this boring thing going from one side to

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:27,260
the other if we turn it 90 degrees we

00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:30,110
can create a freefall effect so we have

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:34,160
this now this doesn't look at all like

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:37,040
something free falling okay so we must

00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,170
emulate freefall and to amelie free fall

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,230
we must be remind the acceleration of

00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:44,260
the gravity of Earth so we will apply

00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:48,370
the quickest here is seen

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:50,500
function to this circle falling and as

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,600
you can see here also the frames in the

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,660
middle change which are only in our mind

00:21:52,600 --> 00:22:00,640
they are abstract but the change changes

00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:03,400
will awake this both elements fell at

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,530
the same time there are two seconds but

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,690
we can see that this one is totally

00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:10,150
different and it give us a real

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,820
sensation of free falling off gravity

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:16,690
attraction whether this one doesn't

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,700
arrow to get this a little bit better we

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,610
can apply first Newton law which is

00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,350
action and reaction that basically says

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,260
that for each and every action there is

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,390
an equal and opposite reaction now if we

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,480
let something drop even if we don't

00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:33,790
realize the floor is pushing at us okay

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:38,530
we don't see we don't feel being pushed

00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:41,110
by the earth but it does so the this

00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,000
this bowl if it is made of rubber or

00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,190
something flexible it will probably get

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,320
squash and stretch so we can apply this

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:51,820
to make this animation you have more

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,140
real and here is again and as you can

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,540
see when it touches the ground it

00:22:53,140 --> 00:23:00,820
squashes and stretches a little bit now

00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:03,010
going forward and looks five predefined

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:08,370
timing functions I'm not really enough

00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:11,560
and they actually all our numbers okay

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:14,170
so we have way more than those stuff

00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,380
with the whole Kubek receiver where we

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:19,270
can actually talk about embassy groups

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,340
the Bezier curves are the one that we

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,370
use in illustrator and photoshop

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,350
photoshop when you use path and maybe

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:30,640
you never knew they were call it that

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:33,480
and here they work this waste because we

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,040
are working in with the cubic Bezier

00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,890
okay so not only what's your code but a

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,440
cubic capacity and we will have four

00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:44,170
points point zero point one point to one

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,780
point three point zero will always be in

00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:51,220
the same place which is 0 0 1 point 3 in

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:53,050
1 1 so we will tell this to go from one

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,450
place to the other in a different way

00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:57,970
and we are always talking about progress

00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:01,750
over time

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,240
so if the line is more horizontal we are

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:07,300
talking about and a slower animation

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,930
because it will cover less progress in

00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,970
more time and on the other side if the

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,950
line is moral isn't a mood but more

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,650
vertical we'll be talking about a faster

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:21,760
animation because we got more progress

00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:24,430
in less time and again here a slow so

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,420
more horizontal a slower more particle

00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:31,150
faster to create these Bezier curves we

00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:34,660
need the coordinates of point 1 and

00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:37,120
point 2 and when we get those two

00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:40,840
coordinates of each we apply them to

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,540
what we know was going a seer in this

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,810
case and we got the linear function that

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,150
goes from 0 to 1 without any

00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:52,510
acceleration that's why there is no cool

00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:54,310
at all it means that we will have a

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:58,300
constant speed and it will not

00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:02,110
accelerate in this example coffee we get

00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:04,830
coffee bean drinkin by a not brilliant

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:09,070
to see a stone at your stick drinker and

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:11,050
it go from 0 to 1 and I got the this

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:14,440
linear time in function with doesn't

00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:16,780
accelerate at all now if we look an

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,840
another other kind of examples more

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,940
interesting then we get this one for

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,040
example which is something that goes

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:27,490
faster at the beginning and then slows

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,190
down here on the numbers and we apply it

00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:34,000
again to coffee so we get a more

00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,740
enthusiastic coffee drinker and as you

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,160
can see it goes faster at the beginning

00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:41,170
and slowly at the end you can change the

00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,270
spin and you will have the same

00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:46,660
acceleration because it's relative to

00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:49,480
add validation and you can make it a

00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,280
longer and it will still have the same

00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,640
acceleration going faster at the

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,830
beginning and a slower at the end now

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,660
there are two rules to play a little bit

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,780
more with a cubic Bezier first one

00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:05,500
instable x values must be between 0 and

00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:08,500
1 and that's only one is up both y

00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,520
values can be out of range can be more

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,490
than one

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,760
also be negative and with these we can

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:18,580
create other examples for example one

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:23,200
value out of range thus when we create

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:27,070
bouncing effect so here we got it it

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,110
will go faster and it will go over the

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,660
number one that means you will go over

00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:34,150
its destination which is one and then

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,210
you will go back and this is our

00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:41,410
balancing here is our value of the

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:43,840
fringe which is why to hear so if we

00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:47,410
apply to something simple we can see

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:51,430
this awesome and then coming back to its

00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:54,520
destination which is here now this can

00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:56,470
be applied to any kind of elements and

00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,380
any kind of property not only width and

00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:02,320
height so for example we can apply to a

00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:05,680
transform and even a color and the color

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,330
will bounce as well so as you can see

00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:12,790
when we hover over it and it goes bigger

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:16,750
past its destination and then it goes

00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:19,210
back okay and the same one we don't

00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:24,210
hover over it anymore okay because it's

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:28,510
a transition and we can make this more

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,920
extreme with true and what you can stick

00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:33,580
here i'm not sure if you can see it yeah

00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,490
the color also balances ok so the color

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:40,240
goes brighter and then it goes back to

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:43,180
its original which is green so these

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,160
tiny functions that bounce angle back

00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:47,950
and forth can be applied not only to

00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,710
width and height and two positions but

00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:53,170
also to colors because colors can bounce

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:56,740
as well it goes brighter and then it

00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,570
goes back now what if we have two values

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,950
of the fringe well one possibility is

00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:05,650
this where we get also burns but our

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:11,200
suite consists it will be faster and

00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:16,750
more like strict so as you can see kind

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,520
of hits the spot um what if we have

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,230
negative values negative values are

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,230
interesting because we go back before

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:26,140
going forth for example here

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:29,830
we go before the progression time we can

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:32,890
always go before negative in the why not

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:35,049
in the x axis because we can really we

00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:38,020
cannot really go back in time liking in

00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:41,020
reality so it's a will with being

00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,179
negative in the progress so we'll be

00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,870
negative in the progress and then it

00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:52,210
will go back to 11 which is the last

00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:55,390
ination and we get this so it goes back

00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:59,020
and then it goes forth if we wanted to

00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:02,049
go more back then this number will be

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:06,040
bigger always negative and we create

00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:09,610
create whatever we want eventually we'll

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:14,770
be like annoying but it's totally okay

00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:17,169
because this CSS so that number

00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,770
sometimes in the the website go VAP a

00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:23,230
silicone we can really push back and

00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:26,710
like negative 7 but we can if we bright

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:29,530
it so there's no problem with that and

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,960
what if we have again one positive value

00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:35,470
out of range and what negative we can

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:38,590
also create and going back Condon going

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:41,260
with a bounce and it looks like

00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:45,340
something like this negative why I'm

00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:48,910
positive why Annie will bounce ball

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:53,650
sweat back and forth and again we can

00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:56,770
make this more extreme like this with

00:29:53,650 --> 00:30:00,730
bigger numbers and this will destroy the

00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:03,100
slides there so another example with

00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:05,440
this way more interesting is about

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:09,730
balancing in the middle of the animation

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,799
and that can be created if we change the

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:14,590
position of the negative and the

00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:17,020
positive in the other example we have

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,540
the negative here and the positive here

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,610
if we turn those around and we got the

00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,730
positive here and the negative here then

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:30,040
we make this bounce in the middle of the

00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:33,730
animation okay so we get this bouncing

00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,530
element in the middle now that can be

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:41,090
again

00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:47,970
take into an extreme in any way you want

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:50,880
like this so if y 1 is positive and y 2

00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:55,680
is negative then we get the bouncing in

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:58,920
the middle and so what we have here and

00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:03,240
first of all try to use the steps before

00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:06,230
using give because of it equality on the

00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,760
fight will probably look way better and

00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,940
transitions are totally okay with a step

00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,710
so have no problem using it Applied

00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,630
Physics whenever facing on earth

00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:19,950
animation so whenever you are talking

00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:21,840
about gravity and all the others try

00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,730
applying fixes because it will improve

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,720
the animation and you will look more

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,250
real also create endless possibilities

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,000
with cubic Bezier you can really have

00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:35,310
fun with that and remember this is these

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,110
are animation concepts not only where

00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,970
you don't have to apply them to web

00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,890
design if you feel like making a stop

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,170
motion you will recognize you have

00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:46,110
accelerations and decelerations and

00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:48,270
frames as well because its basics of

00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:51,930
animation actually not only web design

00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:54,240
and also remember that accession 18 it's

00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,390
okay in animations because you can get

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,610
funnier and more engaging experiences

00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:02,820
like this when chomping drops in reality

00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:05,520
is like boring but if I draw like a lot

00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,590
of champagne and explosions were

00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,350
something drops then it will look like

00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:13,070
funny no more engaging not real but it's

00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:16,140
an animation doesn't have to look real

00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:18,690
this another example a punch never looks

00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,480
like that I mean the person will fall to

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:24,210
the ground believe that it is and it
