	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
um today I've come to talk to you about

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,290
color because we leave in kind of a

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,480
magical digital world of color wear any

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,030
color you want you can just dial up in

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,120
Photoshop using your sliders but it

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,920
didn't always used to be that way

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,600
historical artists were stuck in the

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,220
time that they were born in they only

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,039
had access to the tools and the

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,920
chemicals available in the years that

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,289
they were working one of the first

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,109
chemical colors to be discovered and

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,100
used throughout art is called cochineal

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,380
or red its a bright beautiful red and

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,210
it's made out of beals it's mad of

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,309
beetles which are parasites on certain

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,460
types of cactuses and they can only be

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:48,620
harvested every two weeks four out of

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,420
every year so not so easy to make it

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,489
this very same color is not used in

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,520
painting anymore but it's still used in

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,149
makeup as a food dye and makeup and food

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,770
as a dye for red color one of the things

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,320
that I think that is really interesting

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,780
about red is that it's one of the first

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,150
colors to be named as every culture

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,460
progresses as most cultures progress

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,960
they invent names for colors and a

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,790
fairly predictable pattern and red

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,140
perhaps because it's the color of blood

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,540
is really named first so it's really

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:27,630
emotional it's very powerful color to

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,700
use another historical color that's

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,210
interesting is tyree and purple this was

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,770
used in Greek and you know like as early

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,509
as 2300 i think BCE in greece and it was

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,729
a beautiful purple only royalty was

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,979
allowed to wear it it was very expensive

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,939
because the way that they laid it which

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,549
we would

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,799
300 pounds of shellfish this particular

00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:53,649
type of shellfish was only made only

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,360
available in present-day Lebanon so you

00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:57,130
get 300 pounds of shellfish and you put

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,840
it out by the beach with some hot water

00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,490
and you allow it to ferment for like a

00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,570
couple of weeks until you can extract

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:07,570
one ounce of die for your purple toga so

00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:11,830
that may be why today we think of purple

00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,810
as the color of royalty one thing that's

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,190
interesting about purple too is that the

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,989
Tiran purple through the process I

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,170
described the garment that were dyed

00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:22,150
purple tended to retain the smell of the

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,269
shellfish that had been used to make it

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,459
so look great smell maybe not so good

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:31,959
but you know you were purple so that was

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:34,269
awesome ah another color that was used

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,110
in historical times well as lead white

00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:40,989
and this was made by soaking strips of

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,120
lead in vinegar and then covering up

00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:47,650
them up with dung putting that in a pot

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,660
and letting it ferment for months and so

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:53,320
they would make paint and also make up

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:55,359
out of this led led pretty poisonous and

00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:01,079
the people in the 1800's who used it on

00:02:55,359 --> 00:03:01,079
their faces tended to die that was bad

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,519
another thing that's interesting about

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:10,180
it as a paint is that because it was

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,859
used from about the 1900s and before it

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,209
was in the 1900s that we discovered that

00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:16,060
titanium would make a pretty good

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,280
replacement for white if you have an

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,560
x-ray machine you can look at various

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,139
layers of old paintings because you know

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,549
lead and x-rays or you can find

00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:30,400
forgeries that are made with the modern

00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:32,049
paint and not the old LED light so let's

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,600
let's go back a minute and talk to

00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:38,380
ourselves about what is color here we

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,970
have a lovely color spectrum and beyond

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,850
the visible colors beyond what we can

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,350
see there's also infrared and x-ray

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,109
there are energy wavelengths that we

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,650
just can't perceive with our eyeballs so

00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:49,650
that's pretty cool

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,380
but we're smart humans we can make

00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:01,180
machines that can go see other colors

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,730
what we have here is an infrared view of

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,460
Messier 101 it's one of the galaxies in

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:10,810
the sky and with this infrared camera

00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,610
from a space camera then we can see much

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,220
different view of it here's the same

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,440
galaxy in visible light so we get a lot

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,739
more information depending on which

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,290
light we use here's the same galaxy with

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:26,080
x-ray light or an x-ray view of the same

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,660
galaxy and then we can put all of those

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,400
wavelengths together to get a really

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,800
good image of the whole galaxy really

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:38,380
informative an image if we use just the

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,480
colors we can't see all the color types

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,910
that I've talked about so far that's

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,980
using the additive color model and

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,050
that's all about emitted light beams

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,750
this is light that comes down from the

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,850
Sun it comes from a source on it's here

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,270
right now from the lights or if we go

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:58,300
outside it's emitted light if you mix

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,310
different colors together if you mix you

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,720
know the yellow and the green sorry if

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,160
you mix the red on the green you get

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,690
yellow if you mix them all three

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,150
together then you get white so that's

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,770
additive color and that's on all of your

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:13,390
screens that your tablets your

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:17,010
computer's projectors like this it's

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:19,240
primarily a red green blue type of color

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,310
there's a different color model which is

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,820
used for things like t-shirts printed

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,900
posters business cards material and

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,340
because they're different color models

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,120
they're never going to look exactly the

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,580
same subtractive color is all about what

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,830
is reflected off of the material that

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,480
you print something on so we make an ink

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,640
or a pigment and then we lay that down

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,210
on a piece of light and then the light

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,270
reflects only certain colors so it's a

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:51,690
sit at cyan magenta yellow and red all

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,690
mixed together to make black hopefully

00:05:52,290 --> 00:06:01,330
yeah so how do we humans even see color

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,690
well we've got our eyeballs and our

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,910
eyeballs have different cones in them

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,520
most people have three cones one for

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:12,010
sentencing blue one for sensing green

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,200
and one for sensing red and that's cool

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:19,030
that's a diagram of the wavelengths of

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:21,039
various colors dogs only have two cones

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,560
they can only sense yellow and blue

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,140
cones so perhaps that's why your dog

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,360
Fido just runs right past that ball in

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,310
the grass that you throw because if it's

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,500
a red ball in green gasps final can't

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:36,610
tell the difference it's pretty much the

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:39,550
same there are other animals that have

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:42,190
way more cones they can see a multitude

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,590
of colors butterflies have like five

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,780
cones and there's this thing called the

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,810
mantis shrimp that has we're not sure

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,840
but somewhere between 12 and 16

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,600
different light sensing cones you just

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,380
imagine how crazy it would be to see 16

00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:04,180
different colors all at once wow that

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:06,610
would be cool but I talked about how

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,340
most humans have three cones not

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,669
everybody has all of the cones working

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,340
or fully functional four percent of

00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:18,039
humans so that means that maybe eight

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:22,210
people in this room right now can't see

00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:24,520
all of the colors eight percent of men

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,830
and half percent of women in the world

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,240
have some form of colorblindness maybe

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,099
the cones aren't there they're not

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,510
working maybe they can't see green at

00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:35,830
all or maybe it's just a scale so it's

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,070
probably important to think about

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,900
supporting these users because you

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,460
probably support some browsers that are

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,810
even less than four percent of your

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:49,660
traffic it's most common to have

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:53,890
deuteron obeah witch is an ability to

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:56,080
see green colors and less common is read

00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,500
inability sensing which is called proto

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,500
innovia

00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,290
and it's also possible to be missing the

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,730
blue cone that's very uncommon a

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,320
complete colorblindness seeing

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:10,910
everything grayscale that's very very

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:13,520
uncommon in humans so here's a door lock

00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,710
that is that I've simulated using dude

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:21,130
or no provision in Photoshop is this

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,130
door locked or unlocked you can't tell

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,000
so here it is oh it's lock now great we

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,330
can tell it's locked because we can see

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,320
red most of us so it's important to

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,280
remember when you're making something

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,260
that color is a progressive enhancement

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,060
but data and an affordance does need to

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,810
be there before you can layer color on

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:44,140
top of that so let's take a look at a

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:47,900
site perhaps you've seen this one

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,610
perhaps you've checked already oh here

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,320
it is with deuter nope vision again

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,530
using Photoshop that's pretty easy it

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,440
looks good great good work hey another

00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:02,600
site perhaps you've seen this one this

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,730
is can I use which they use green to say

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,430
if a browser supports a certain css3

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,380
feature and use orange to me and is not

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,050
supports not so good and red they need

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,840
no support at all so again this is can I

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,910
use it's a great site really but it

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,580
doesn't look so good with deuteron

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,830
occasion not not so helpful what are you

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,530
going to do well they've given a pretty

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,180
good solution they have an alternate

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,620
color theme that when you go find it in

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,990
the settings you can set up and say oh

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,180
okay I want to have the accessible color

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,850
design on this and then you can go oh

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,560
okay purple means no support and kind of

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,260
pale green means completely supported

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,530
and here's how that would look with Dew

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:45,710
Tour no vision it's discernible it's not

00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:49,090
great it's not great well what can we do

00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:52,640
that might be better in our designs well

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:55,910
instead of using just color add shape

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,430
you can add you know like X's or crosses

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,890
or triangles inside the color dots or

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,850
you can put borders on the edges of

00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:07,300
thing to differentiate them with shapes

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,830
much better and and the thing

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,630
with anything in accessibility this is

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,760
going to help not only the users who

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,459
have color sensing difficulties it's

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,399
going to help everybody because even in

00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:19,570
dark light I would have problems telling

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,180
the difference between blue and purple

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,500
in those squares but I can always see

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:28,839
the difference between octagon and

00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,880
square so something to think about also

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,290
you should test your sites because

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,230
you'll never know how it's going to look

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,450
unless you go looking for trouble the

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,760
easiest way to test is using Photoshop

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,500
it has right on the proof settings it's

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,320
got options for deuteron open proto and

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,360
oak vision so you just go and set the

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,880
proof up and then you can flip the proof

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,880
colors on and off right in Photoshop

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,450
there are also a couple of ways that you

00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:57,970
can test a whole site or whole browser

00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,190
if you've already made something there's

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,380
a a Don for colored for Firefox called

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,709
colorblind design and that's pretty easy

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:08,290
to use when I tested it you do have to

00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:10,029
go into the tools web developer menu and

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,380
then responsive design to you and it's

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,529
one of the filters and the responsive

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,300
design view in Photoshop there's also an

00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:18,070
add-on for chrome if you like chrome

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,350
there's two there's two I testing

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,360
spectrum spectrum super easy to use I

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,930
haven't tested color blinding but it's

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,970
open source so yay and there's also an

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,880
application for your whole computer you

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:33,490
can download called a color Oracle which

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,930
will let you do the entire machine just

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,880
simulate color blindness on the entire

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:43,209
machine so that's a good way to test so

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:45,880
please test let's take a look at a way

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:48,130
that your brain maybe messes with your

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,790
perception of color have a look at the a

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:56,410
and the B squares here yeah which one's

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:59,740
brighter looks pretty obvious oh no I

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:03,810
lied I tricked you a and B are exactly

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:06,670
the same shade it's just that your brain

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:09,339
corrects for this shadow cast by the

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,040
green cylinder and makes you think well

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:12,980
be most be much lighter to be the same

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,100
as a

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:19,730
so your brain sometimes tricks you when

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,529
you see color let's talk about another

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:29,420
color illusion that you might have seen

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:31,130
on the internet recently this thing yeah

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,060
good good everyone still remembers this

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:37,310
stuff sorry for bringing back old

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:39,829
traumas but there's this thing so one

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,380
thing that we is important to understand

00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:44,389
it's about color constancy for example

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,519
if you see a cherry you know cherries

00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,990
are red cherries are always red so even

00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:49,790
if you take a box of cherries into some

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,620
weird lighting your brain is going to

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,350
tell you those cherries are always red

00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,329
even though their color may not actually

00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:01,310
be read if you were to use Photoshop to

00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:02,990
pick the colors out of there so here is

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,060
the first demo it's I'm not going to go

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,820
too heavy because it's early stead but

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,760
what i did is i set up a SVG out of the

00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,470
dress you may know that svgs are just a

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,779
vector markup format for describing

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,180
graphics and you can do it in the

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:21,290
browser what's great about SVG's i can

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:24,589
style in with sass so no problem so i've

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:26,959
given one group the kind of dress shape

00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:28,430
and then another group the lace that's

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,250
going to be the horizontal stripes on

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:34,819
this thing and then I've used saph to

00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:37,010
set up some variables like I've set up

00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:39,620
just that the dress color is this RGB

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,600
value and then I address the dress and

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,459
give it a fill of the dress color

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,959
because with SVG's you fail instead of

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:50,389
setting background color so here's the

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:53,389
dressed the dress when it looks its most

00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:56,029
white and the reason it looks the most

00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:59,000
white in the second slide is that I've

00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:00,829
used a background color of blue with a

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,449
deep blue background color your brain

00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:04,579
attempts to subtract all of the blue

00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:06,769
that it thinks is ambient light thus

00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:11,060
you're probably going to end up with a

00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:13,310
dress that's white with gold ok here's

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:17,569
the same dress with a yellow background

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,790
bright overblown yellow and we just use

00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:21,050
a different background color a two level

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,060
yellow background color your brain and

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,939
attempts to subtract yellow from the

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,279
dress resulting in a blue with black

00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:31,279
stripes dress

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,199
so that's the dress demo I have a

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,910
confession i saw it is blue and black in

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,069
the beginning and i can never ever see

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,920
anything but but i know that that's not

00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:41,810
as everybody's view and that's because

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:48,889
of the color constancy that I described

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:51,680
earlier one thing that artists do when

00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:54,189
they're painting or drawing or something

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,720
is when they want to make a color and

00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:58,519
have highlights and shadows to it they

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,800
take that color and then they literally

00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,750
mix blue or white paint or pigment in

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,750
with that because in the real world

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,639
color and shadows aren't always just

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,709
black or just white the kind of a shade

00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,949
or a tenth of the original color of the

00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:15,829
thing and so the good news is that we

00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:18,740
can do the same thing with sass so

00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:21,529
here's the second demo this is some more

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,509
svgs there are just nine triangles here

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:26,689
and there's three different peaks there

00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:28,790
mountain peaks and then each of the

00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:34,160
peaks has one triangle for highlights

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:37,100
and one triangle for shadows so what

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,500
I've done is I've given the mountains

00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,930
some lovely green color I picked the

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,430
same grey and I said well for the one in

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,420
the middle that's just that grain and

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,220
then the one that's a little bit front

00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,199
it's lighter so I lighten that color a

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,410
little bit and then the one in the back

00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:55,339
I darkened that color a little bit using

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:58,519
SAS then I said well highlight color is

00:15:55,339 --> 00:16:01,100
white and the background color is CSS

00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:05,630
black and then I just used the stroke to

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,800
make an outline of those SVG's so that's

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,959
how I've colored all of the mountain

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,209
peaks and all of the shadows and

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,779
highlights that's okay it looks like

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:18,319
mountains that's kind of harsh what if

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:20,809
instead we mix those greens and into our

00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:22,850
dark and our light colors yeah it's

00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:25,850
pretty better looking so what I did was

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,559
I change the variable so I've used mix

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,680
to mix some of my original mountain

00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:33,350
color in with white and same thing to

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,880
mix a little bit in with black that's

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,040
great cold thats that's pretty cool much

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,550
better looking than white and black as

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,390
far as realistic mountain peak

00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:45,089
go what if we want to have a lovely

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:47,029
orange sunset well that's easy we're

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:55,500
just going to mix in a little bit of the

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:57,060
orange instead of the green so what I

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,310
did is I set up a color and I said okay

00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,959
well here is the highlight orange I want

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,610
to lighten or darken it a little bit and

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,250
then I mix those into the original

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:10,920
colors that I've used on the outlines oh

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:13,530
cool pretty great not so bad you might

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,350
be asking yourself why did I use mix

00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:19,530
when I showed you folks a perfectly good

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:21,270
light than dirt function before and the

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,880
answer is that one of the things that

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:26,550
sass will do when you use lighten or

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,500
darken is it goes okay well I'm going to

00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,330
put fifty percent white in here and on a

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,370
very white color like the pink or the

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,110
orange on the top it very quickly blows

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,960
out all the way to whites you can't see

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,910
it anymore same thing for darken on a

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,840
darker color dark and very quickly blows

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:45,600
out all the way to black but mix allows

00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,890
us to have a fluid scaling in between

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,750
the different colors that we're using

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,460
because we can say okay I want ninety

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,870
percent original color and ten percent

00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,780
of white mix those together and you can

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:57,059
just go all the way across the scale so

00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,419
if you want a more finer division of

00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:07,800
color use mix for SAS rather than light

00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:11,160
or dark cool let's talk about distance

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,900
and photographs for example in a

00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,120
photograph what makes the mountains in

00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,260
the background here look farther away

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,250
than the mountains in the foreground

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,110
well sure the mountains in the

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,780
background appears smaller there they're

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,179
kind of smaller in the frame there there

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,280
may be a little higher up because we're

00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:33,450
looking out to the world and we see

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,740
things go up and the other thing that's

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,120
interesting about the mountains in the

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,179
background in this photograph is that

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,790
they have much less color or much less

00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:46,230
contrast a much less saturation to them

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,600
the exact same thing happens in

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,539
paintings and in this painting there are

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,399
mountains in

00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:54,759
background and even though it's just

00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:56,440
dots of paint on a canvas they appear

00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,509
farther away because of the same tricks

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,369
they're a little bit smaller they're a

00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:01,840
little bit lower contrast they're just

00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:07,720
kind of a little bit faded out in the

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:10,029
background the same thing happens in a

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,710
picture of sunset except everything in

00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:14,409
the back is a little bit or injure and

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,779
all this this fading to blue or orange

00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:19,210
happens because of a thing because

00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:21,940
there's more sky in between you and the

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,349
thing that's very far away so in like

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,090
high near it'll be a little bit more

00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:27,220
blue because that's the atmosphere then

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,029
but in sunset it'll be a little bit more

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:34,210
orange this is what artists call

00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:36,220
atmospheric perspective and that's just

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:40,479
more stuff in between you and the thing

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:43,809
it's actually air that you're seeing so

00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:45,970
that's pretty cool I think so of course

00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:49,509
I made a demo about it so here's some

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,070
more svgs and again I am not showing you

00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:53,229
the entire SVG because these are pretty

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,820
gnarly but there are two groups of SVG's

00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:57,190
that I've grouped using the group

00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,779
element one has a class of sale and

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,970
that's the lovely red stuff those are

00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:03,999
the sales for my boat here and then the

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,950
other group of svgs in the whole group

00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:11,349
that's you know the main body of the

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:13,059
boat and then okay yeah so we've got

00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:15,879
salen hole in a group and we can style

00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,590
all those svgs is one block and the same

00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:20,499
thing I set up a color variable to make

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,960
the sale a lovely little red and there's

00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:25,419
a whole variable that's kind of a brown

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,249
and then I fill the sale with the sale

00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:29,249
color fill the hole with the whole color

00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:37,539
so here we have the sale and the whole

00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:38,979
looking a little farther away you're

00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:40,929
going to have to imagine for me please

00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:42,340
that these are smaller and farther up in

00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:44,470
the frame cuz i still wanted you to be

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,210
able to see them on the projector but

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,159
what I've done is I've changed the color

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,859
for each of them by mixing it a little

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,539
bit of sky blue sky blue is another CSS

00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:54,539
named color so that was super convenient

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,519
so yeah we just mix in seventy percent

00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,140
of the sale color with thirty percent of

00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,940
the skype

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,100
color same for the whole you know the

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,440
whole it looks pretty good it looks

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,390
further away but that sale it looks a

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,160
little funky that's a little bit not so

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,670
good we're gonna we're going to change

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:17,400
that up what we're going to do instead

00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,980
on the sale color is we're going to mix

00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,900
the sale with the compliments of itself

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,430
and this is a SAS color function i'll

00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:28,470
walk you right through it on the inside

00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:31,110
of the fill line we have a complement of

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,360
sale and complement just spins the color

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,640
around 180 degrees along the color wheel

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,970
to pick the opposite for example yellow

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,860
is the complement of green so we just

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,800
picked the complement of whatever color

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,470
sale was and then we mix sale with the

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,940
compliments of itself by about seventy

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,700
percent so that gives us kind of a more

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,800
faded slightly darker red then in this

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:59,760
example is more effective for the sale

00:21:52,800 --> 00:22:01,860
color than mixing in the blue color so

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,710
we talked about a couple of tricks that

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,670
artists use we talked about using

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,040
complement and we talked about using

00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,840
nicks and if you want any of the links

00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,090
to any of the demos you can grab them

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,660
from this link here or you can grab them

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:19,080
from my Twitter account and that is some

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,230
facts about color great thank you very

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,230
