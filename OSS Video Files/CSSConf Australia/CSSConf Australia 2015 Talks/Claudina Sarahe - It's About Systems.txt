I'm going to go out on a limb here I

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:09,179
figure you're an open crowd I'm already

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:11,730
in a onesie so you know here it is um

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,110
I'm a little worried actually that we've

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,990
been approaching front-end development

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,150
incorrectly right and I'm worried we

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,730
will continue to do this unless we

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:25,470
embrace laws and theories that govern

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:29,279
our field yeah front-end web development

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,969
is the system web in general is a system

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,040
in the most basic sense a system is made

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,399
a connection of pieces that come

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,800
together to form a whole so because web

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,309
is a system we're governed by the

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,840
theories of systems design and systems

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,579
thinking as engineers we know the best

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,579
way to solve a large problem is to break

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,050
it down into all our problems and we

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,960
keep breaking down these smaller

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,870
problems and each problem becomes hosed

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,539
into even tinier pieces until after

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,420
enough iterations we have a problem that

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,880
can be solved on its own sort of like a

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,310
discrete function right and after all

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,110
this decomposition of our problem what

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,140
we're left with are these small tiny

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,770
components and deciding what these

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,009
components are how they fit together and

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,369
how they relate that's the activity of

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,790
systems design but you already knew that

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,700
right you're like in a onesie come on

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,700
we're ahead of you here so most of us

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,250
know that we have to stop coding and

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,829
designing page by page we're done

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,049
throwing multi-layer PSD mock-ups over

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,060
the wall right like we're doing this all

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,820
right we know we should think in terms

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,600
of components and modules that we should

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,729
aim for reusability standardization

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,380
reducing variation and reviving to

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,740
maintain like an overall pattern

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,320
language building it's empowering

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,820
libraries because we recognize the

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,820
immense value of these holes and

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,849
processes and models bring to our

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,129
projects and at the same time we're

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,680
working out of Lee we're employing these

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,420
agile methodologies and practices

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,680
and we're prioritizing our users

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,120
throughout the entire process so it

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,239
appear as an industry that we're really

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,730
on trick which is great all right we're

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,000
actually prioritizing new processes that

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:33,810
exhibit and adhere to systems thinking

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,420
and design so what's the problem all

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,920
right so you're asking me here's the

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:43,849
thing we're doing so not because we've

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,859
actually recognized an apply hurry

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:50,040
rather because we were driven to do so

00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:52,560
we were practically cornered our old

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,620
processes were not working with the new

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,219
constraints of this multi-device world

00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:01,620
which honestly seems like not care we

00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,260
have to we don't care about site

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,969
performance until owns came along and

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,560
went into the market and we realized

00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,650
that we couldn't continue to send these

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,019
bloated pages we didn't really care

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,120
about performance standards designs

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,090
until we were forced to design

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,310
responsibly and suddenly scalability and

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:32,549
maintenance became these top priorities

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:34,819
in our projects just yes ok remember all

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,500
those terrible hacks we'd perform for

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:40,319
gradients and drop shadows and rounded

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,479
corners back when it was actually like

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,389
the most difficult to do these things

00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:50,250
our PSD's would be full of this like

00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:53,189
terrible bloated design and now when we

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,150
actually have native browser adoption we

00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:59,819
avoid them like the plague so I'm not

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,430
here to whine and complain I'm really

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,400
happy that we're actually exhibiting so

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:08,280
much care and concern I'm thrilled that

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,439
we're able to veer course no matter how

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,840
late or when in the process this is

00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,909
actually happening it doesn't matter

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,859
when we notice things that are wrong or

00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:21,150
ill-fitting what matters is that we

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,560
address them but here's the thing if

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,380
we're only going to do things because

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,240
we're forced to do them then we will

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,970
never solve our most

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,740
problems and personally I don't think

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,319
this laisser faire approach is

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,139
sustainable it means that we are waiting

00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,389
for triggers instead of being aware and

00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,030
questioning and challenging ourselves at

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:46,250
all times it means that we're passive

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:49,160
instead of active right as a shame

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:54,509
because we here are some of the best

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,610
problem solvers so if we have a better

00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:59,900
understanding of systems theory and

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:04,110
design we will be able to stay ahead

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:07,229
without relying on tools and changes in

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:13,669
our external environment to drive change

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:15,810
and make us care so let's dig into them

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,720
the principles of systems thinking

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,240
actually go really far back as far as

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,240
Aristotle and the Ionian philosophers

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,330
who in the 6th century BC were the ones

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,669
that started to see the world as orderly

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:32,669
hence intelligible and ultimately that

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,800
meant that it could be controlled but

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,469
the theory of systems which is fondly

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,870
known as general Systems Theory or GST

00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:44,669
is attributed to this man hair ludvik a

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,729
developmental biologist philosopher a

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,979
poet and actually a playwright who in

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:52,530
the mid 50s and 60s began to question

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,080
the newtonian simplistic views that were

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,819
used to describe and understand science

00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,440
and really they were just applied to the

00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:04,319
world around us so up until then science

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,409
had always tried to explain observable

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,919
phenomenon by reducing it to the

00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:13,590
interplay of an elementary unit each one

00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:16,590
was investigated independently sort of

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,840
acting like a one way causality this

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,419
Newtonian simplicity or what is often

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,669
called the reductionism it's central to

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:26,250
many sciences it's mostly central to the

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,919
hard sciences not a big fan of that term

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,800
but things like physics biology and

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,810
chemistry where we see systems like

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,699
atoms and then two atoms we can

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,250
molecules and macromolecules and so

00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,960
forth right the problem with this

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:44,199
approach is that it's incredibly to

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,810
simple it actually completely fails to

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,690
understand the whole in relation to its

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,620
parts all it's doing is reducing parts

00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,759
from the whole right so while

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,099
reductionism can be this really good

00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,590
mental exercise for beginning to

00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:02,039
understand how to break things apart it

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:05,680
really does not solve our problems

00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:08,800
because it's actually failing to deal

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,800
with properties of organization and thus

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:16,150
it's limiting our understanding of the

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,820
complexity of the entire system the

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:22,560
individual pieces although we understand

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:25,690
them are really disconnected we're not

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,060
viewing them as a whole and I really I

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,660
ran into this problem about a year ago

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,820
in January with with the team i work

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,560
with called odd bird I was tasked to

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,690
build this pattern library from existing

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,880
code and about that time that's when

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,490
Brad frost released the pattern pattern

00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,099
lab which is kind of a system in kind of

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,960
a reductionist system at the same time

00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:49,509
so in my documentation I was actually

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,220
like this pattern library and style

00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,840
guide is based on the theories and

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,610
principles of reductionism because I was

00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,340
like this is exactly makes perfect sense

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,889
distill the little pieces and then a

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,289
component is made up of them and so I

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,780
went about this and what was the end

00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,919
result the end result which is a

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,280
complete mess that we couldn't

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,110
understand we couldn't really see the

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,990
connections between pieces we'd broken

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,900
things down to such a small point that

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:20,169
it really didn't help us organize

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:25,810
patterns and everyone on the team was

00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:28,780
confused so that doesn't work right so

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:32,589
what is what is Ludwig say he basically

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:37,800
says there has to be another way this

00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:42,039
can't just be it there must be a higher

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:44,470
theory or order that's dealing with

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,620
common patterns and behaviors across

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,380
properties that we the observer can

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:54,310
analyze and use to develop greater

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,970
insight into creating these seething

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,470
develop better in

00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:01,680
site into the behavior of complex

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:06,519
phenomenon so general Systems Theory is

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,850
really a science of wholeness one that

00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:12,279
takes a holistic view recognizing the

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,939
inevitable interaction between a system

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:19,060
and its embedding environment so its

00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:22,000
approach to problem solving where

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,600
problems are understood as part of the

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,379
system instead of reacting to specific

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,370
outcomes or events and this helps us

00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:36,069
avoid unintended consequences right this

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,370
to me is one of the main reasons why we

00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:42,120
need to embrace systems thinking to

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,100
avoid unintended consequences and

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,860
granted we do a good job of cleaning up

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:52,870
after ourselves but if we can anticipate

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:56,319
them we're going to do even better and a

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:59,139
telling example of this for me is our

00:09:56,319 --> 00:10:02,230
inability to let go of this idea of best

00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:05,529
practice right what does that really

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,019
mean actually in a system you can't have

00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,639
a best practice in a system because

00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:14,050
that's ignoring that the system could

00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:15,550
change and that practice can change so I

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,220
really don't need to enumerate this

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:20,860
because some phenomenal people have

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,550
actually given talks on this one of them

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:27,850
is here and I highly encourage you to

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,970
watch them and chat with them and these

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,339
people that are thinking this way are

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:36,279
the systems thinker of our time so pick

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:40,360
their brains right so what else is

00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:42,180
unique about systems another key

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,709
property is that they are actually

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,660
self-regulating through feedback so we

00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:48,639
can see this in our field as well we get

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,189
feedback that we should not send two

00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,569
megabytes of images to someone's phone

00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:56,019
because they can't use it and they get

00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,850
angry at us and we correct course this

00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:01,000
also supports the notion that best

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,860
practices are a farce if there's

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,160
feedback that it doesn't work if it's

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,610
not working let it go the system is

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,850
trying to correct itself

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,860
and we practice this time also in our

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:19,150
development methodologies such as agile

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,260
or iterative development this is also we

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,870
can also see this in terms of

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,510
refactoring our code that's a type of

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,030
feedback retrospectives give us feedback

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:32,590
on what we're doing and listening of

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:35,230
course to our users general Systems

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,990
Theory also gives us principles of

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,840
organization and structure and these are

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,930
actually missing in the newtonian

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,850
simplistic view of the world and this

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,130
was one of the big reasons that Ludwig

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:52,750
was like I don't think this can apply

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:55,720
because human beings actually exhibit

00:11:52,750 --> 00:12:11,160
organization and structure so we can't

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:17,050
reduce ourselves down to one thing okay

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:20,560
so as we can see our field and our

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,660
practices are very much aligned to the

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,250
underlying models of general systems

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:29,290
processes but as far as I can see we're

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:33,220
actually not talking about it in terms

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:36,910
of system thinking or systems design or

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:40,030
systems architecture you can actually

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:42,340
run a search on our popular web magazine

00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,530
that we love so dear a list apart for

00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,830
the term like systems thinking our

00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,560
systems design or systems theory and not

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,990
a single article will mention this

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,860
underlying principle that governs our

00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,570
field granted we are recognizing that we

00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,020
are building things and systems and

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:06,600
components so the terms will come up but

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:12,180
we've never really talked about this law

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:14,710
so why is this the first is that

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,889
honestly there are very few classes for

00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,369
this field

00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:20,720
and if it's actually taught its kind of

00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:22,939
sequestered away into fields of

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,189
engineering or operations management or

00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:27,920
business it's not really offered as a

00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:30,199
general course at least in the US they'd

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,660
rather that you take phys ed to graduate

00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:34,910
instead of perhaps understand one of the

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:39,399
most important theories that really kind

00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,399
of governs most of our existence right

00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:46,970
secondly if it's not taught then it's

00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,609
and it's not readily accessible via

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,319
traditional avenues of education then

00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:54,889
how are we going to find it in our field

00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:56,509
which is this hodgepodge of misfits many

00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:59,389
of us end up here without formal

00:13:56,509 --> 00:14:01,869
education in web development we're

00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:04,579
self-taught or with dropouts or

00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:06,199
polymaths mean we'll do what we want

00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:08,809
here and I actually think this is

00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,759
awesome the diversity of our field is a

00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:12,350
great thing it means that we have more

00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,749
perspectives it means that we have a

00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,480
potential of understanding different

00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:22,519
pieces of the system from ways that we

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:25,759
might not see the next reason is that

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,249
systems design and theory is actually

00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:31,009
really hard to teach so even if you're

00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:33,220
lucky to get a class it's one of these

00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:36,679
practices that's best learned by doing

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,660
which I feel is a lot of our field all

00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:41,089
right we need to sit down and practice

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,649
and it's great when we have mentors and

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,489
we can work on teams with people that

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:50,269
are exhibiting these thought processes

00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:53,660
so if we have to learn on the job that

00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:57,739
means that our jobs actually must

00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:01,699
prioritize systems design which they

00:14:57,739 --> 00:15:06,499
don't most of them some of them do we're

00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:08,959
getting better but it's hard because it

00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:10,660
takes a lot of time and there are always

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,639
these constraints

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,769
that we have to meet we have to have

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:20,800
this feature it has to ship all right

00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:24,490
systems design takes really hard

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,769
thinking it also takes long discussions

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,779
with other engineers and stakeholders

00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:32,170
and team members it is incredibly

00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:34,560
collaborative it requires an environment

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:38,500
that prioritizes failure and

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,899
experimentation it requires team members

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,029
that recognize that if you start an idea

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,019
and you spend two to three weeks on it

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,449
and then all of a sudden you realize

00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:50,370
that this isn't going to work that that

00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:53,649
isn't wasted time but that's actually

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:58,329
incredibly important to your process and

00:15:53,649 --> 00:16:02,290
should not be ignored so sadly

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:04,959
management and anyone above us don't

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,410
they don't recognize this unless again

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,839
you're lucky to work company that does

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:14,170
they you know they want to see visible

00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,990
progress they want to see those PSD

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:20,670
comps they want to see you committing

00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:23,800
code they don't want to see you thinking

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:31,300
they don't have value for false starts

00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:33,220
and experiments lastly these types of

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,630
problems that we're solving are actually

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:39,790
really hard complexity is used to

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,589
characterize something with many parts

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:46,420
and these parts interact in multiple

00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:52,240
ways it's difficult complicated is hard

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:54,699
but solvable complex might not solve

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,170
something that's complex at best you

00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,660
might come up with a solution that works

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,250
for that moment realizing that you

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:07,030
probably have to adapt and change it

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:10,439
down the line our relationship with our

00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:13,480
environment is actually one of the most

00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,970
complex sets of interdependent

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,209
connections and if we think about

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:21,339
front-end development those of us that

00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,430
are actually tasked with understanding

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,560
not only the user

00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,900
but also the business requirements and

00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,070
being able to translate these

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:38,460
performance usable designs too many oh

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:41,910
no wonder this field is so hard so how

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,100
can we strive to apply more of these

00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,650
tenants of systems theory and thinking

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,210
and design to our work I've already

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,160
touched on some of the methods we are

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,630
using like style guides and pattern

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,440
libraries and these are a wonderful

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:59,130
start but what other processes are

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,830
available so I'm going to take a look at

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,360
some additional tools and ideas that

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,760
have helped me and the teams that I've

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,380
been working on be more systematic in

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:13,010
terms of thought and design and process

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:16,590
there are many models to pull from and

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:19,410
the more choices we have the better so

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:23,280
this is by no means an exhaustive list

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:25,950
but the exercises have yielded more

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:31,170
sound systems at least I feel we've been

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:33,870
doing better so the first you must

00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,670
define your system these are the visions

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,500
the requirements the goals of whatever

00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,870
you're building think of this as that in

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,030
closing membrane every time that you

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:46,110
make a decision it must be bounced off

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,610
of your vision isn't meeting our goal do

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,910
we need this is this going to help us

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,440
achieve what we want to do so the way

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,510
that we start out is we actually have

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,310
two documents a bunch of questions that

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,170
we sit down and go through with our

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,950
stakeholders and they can include things

00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:04,170
like give us two sentences as to what

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,410
you see what's the vision for this app

00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:10,350
what five features do you think will

00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:12,870
help you achieve this we ask them about

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,610
their weaknesses how do they feel as a

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,190
company what are their weaknesses who

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:25,020
are their competitors get them to really

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:27,290
dig in and understand from there we take

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,430
the vision what they want to achieve

00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:32,340
requirements which can include things

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,440
like this site has to be accessible or

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,470
this site is going to be translated into

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:42,540
nine different languages and we start to

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:45,570
collate this into stories and and

00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,540
working on many teams I found that the

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:51,240
best stories put us the developer and

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:54,120
the position of the actor instead of

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,790
defining features like build the user

00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,050
review component we want to try things

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:03,360
like as a user I want to leave reviews

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:06,000
now we can think about this if a user

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,180
wants to leave reviews how do they do

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,090
that what fields does the user need to

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:14,760
leave reviews this type of framing of

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,790
our tasks and features sets us up for

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:21,780
the next phase it gets us to ask

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:26,250
questions immediately instead of build

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:29,820
the user review component okay I guess

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:35,270
so start with what's attached in the

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:38,550
design all right so this next phase

00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:40,290
after we've got our stories now we need

00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,110
to figure out how this content lays out

00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,450
on our site and this can get called many

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,160
things and we often have many fancy

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,560
names for people that work on this

00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,990
section like information architect or

00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,180
content strategist or all these names

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:58,260
that are in my opinion just a pure

00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:01,200
distraction and creating silos does not

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,690
matter put every smart person on your

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,850
team at this point because this is the

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,730
hard part this is the part where you're

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:11,100
dealing with a lot of ambiguity and you

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:16,110
have to trust that at the end of it

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:18,330
there's a path there's a structure to

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:22,470
your application that you understand the

00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:25,110
ins and out of so we start with sitemaps

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,450
and we try to do as much of our work

00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:30,030
actually in browser and we use a tool

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,860
called CSS slick maps and there's a

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,470
there's a compass extension if you run

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,720
sass we've switched over to live sass

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,850
recently and

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,250
it's quite interesting we've we've been

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:43,100
working on a lips as compatible release

00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:46,250
but you know priorities but maybe one of

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:50,570
you will do it so CSS slick Maps lets

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:52,840
you create clickable site maps and when

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,730
you start you might not know everything

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:58,610
let's say we have a site that's got we

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,980
know we want user profiles we know we

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,960
want users to leave ratings it'll be a

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,080
rating page we'll start out by just

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,150
putting everything at the top level and

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,460
not really worrying and trusting that

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:16,429
we're able to come back and correctly

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:17,960
group things by the best taxonomy the

00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:20,140
next most important piece that is

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,669
something that I've started working with

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,610
since joining odd bird about a year and

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:27,380
a half ago and honestly in the ten years

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,059
that I've done web development this is

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,679
probably the first time where I've

00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:32,600
worked with a team that prioritizes

00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,210
content templates and has taught me the

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,549
immense value of working with them

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,500
there's a wonderful article by Aaron

00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:43,299
cuisine on a list apart that explains

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:46,640
content templates but in short this

00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:49,370
content template defines what's going on

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,440
your page it starts with a brief

00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:54,010
description the goals of what you want

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,500
to achieve and it can get very detailed

00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:59,840
you can be specific and say i'm going to

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,700
have one paragraph that's no longer than

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,070
250 words followed by three bullet

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,919
points on the product review page that's

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:10,460
incredibly helpful but what your goal is

00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:13,760
here is to define the pieces of content

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:16,730
that go on the page you want to get to

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,159
the fields what's the information that

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,590
the user is going to see and then you

00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,110
want to fill that in with actual content

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,900
none of this lorem ipsum stuff because

00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:28,880
that doesn't help us right so this

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,730
process really ensures that we're

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,220
actually meeting the requirements and

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,440
the visions that we're addressing the

00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,330
whole and what ends up happening when

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,710
we're working on this is that sometimes

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,470
things will come up and were like oh

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,539
wait a minute that's not in any of our

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:46,790
vision documents that's not in our

00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:48,650
requirements is this necessary

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,120
it is then we need to go back and amend

00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,670
that and it's this constant

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,170
back-and-forth this constant ability of

00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,510
being able to understand the piece that

00:23:54,170 --> 00:24:05,690
you're working on but never forget the

00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:06,890
whole lastly sketches prototypes once

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,230
you have an understanding of what

00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,360
content you want in an example of the

00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,670
content and your content templates you

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,980
can start sketching that out so let's

00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:19,070
say we define our user review component

00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:22,760
to have three fields it's got the user's

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:26,710
name the avatar and the a description of

00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:30,410
their review now your designer or your

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:32,060
user experience designer or whomever on

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,160
your team is responsible for sketches

00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,600
and prototyping can take those three

00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,150
fields and begin to think of how they

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,030
should come together Eric Suzanne my

00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:44,200
colleague uses the simple paper app on

00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:46,760
his iPad to just do rough sketches and

00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,590
either he'll implement them in HTML or

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,570
I'll throw them into HTML as soon as we

00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:56,120
feel like we've got something and then

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:57,950
we continue to iterate from there the

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,290
next thing that I find really helps us

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:04,340
and our processes is to use the most

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:07,670
robust tools that we can when the web

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,920
started CSS and HTML as they are as

00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,860
these flat languages were the most

00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,500
robust tools that we had so we use them

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,140
and it's fine if you still want to use

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:22,220
them but we have even better tools and

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:26,240
it's fun to use those tools because they

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:29,210
let us architect they let us do a better

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,340
job of really component izing and module

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,520
izing our code and keep us in this

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:38,480
systems thinking mindset so instead of

00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:43,030
HTML look for a robust templating

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:46,130
language if you work in rails start

00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:49,130
investigating into helpers and

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,230
decorators and partials and creating

00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:54,740
your components into these reusable

00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:57,500
objects I work at a Python shop we use

00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,540
jinja which has a node variant called

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,350
nunchucks I love it lets us create

00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,510
macros

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,919
which in my mind are just these reusable

00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:07,090
pieces of code that we can pass

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,520
arguments to and generate full blocks of

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:13,059
HTML and there's handlebars and mustache

00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,000
and a bunch of others so spend some time

00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:19,669
don't just pick Hamel or don't just pick

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,630
what someone gives you think about it

00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:26,559
it's a tool same for CSS preprocessors

00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:29,480
post processors whatever your flavor

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:35,210
better than writing plain CSS at this

00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:38,090
point guidelines documentation and

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:40,820
standards probably one of the easiest

00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:45,020
ways to tell whether or not the system

00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:48,880
was actually designed with something in

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:51,169
mind a project without documentation I'm

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,090
questioning whether or not you really

00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:55,280
thought about it as a whole you

00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:57,890
shouldn't have to read through your code

00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,929
and guess what's going on if I read

00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,440
through your code things should be well

00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:06,710
documented should have to ask you

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:09,530
self-explanatory and there's a bunch of

00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,120
different methodologies and people have

00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:13,220
done a wonderful job of putting a lot of

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,750
information out there there's CSS

00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,450
guidelines that we heard of from Harry

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:20,980
there's sass guidelines that Hugo has

00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:25,190
been working on there are code standards

00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:27,409
github 'he's a most recent style guide

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:29,710
actually has an entire section on coding

00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:33,470
standards these are things that you want

00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:35,390
right these set a tone for your system

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:41,120
and ensure that anyone can come in and

00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:42,760
work on it I cannot stress the

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,440
importance of communication and getting

00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:50,539
our work done we need to talk we need to

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,059
iterate and then we need to keep doing

00:27:50,539 --> 00:28:00,200
this take your headphones off ask your

00:27:53,059 --> 00:28:02,270
team member prod them don't be afraid so

00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,179
whether or not you agree or disagree

00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:08,390
with me that this perceived lack of

00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:11,419
systems knowledge is leading us a we ask

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:14,240
you I hope that we can at least agree

00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:17,420
that systems thinking and design

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,740
something that we as an industry should

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:25,280
understand right it's a fundamental view

00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:27,559
of the world that says that when we

00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,960
build and design and make decisions

00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:33,200
about something we can't do it in

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,640
isolation we have to be aware of the

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,320
world around it and within it and this

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,580
really ensures that things become more

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:47,059
coherent more whole and ultimately

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:52,600
ensures that we're respecting the web of

00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:55,850
nature my name is cloudiness nie and I

00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,070
organize and speak and work I run a

00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,990
similar cough similar commerce but I run

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,210
a conference called sask off and I

00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:06,170
organize monthly meetup in New York I

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:08,720
work with a rad team of brothers and a

00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:11,090
designer in Denver Nate called odd bird

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,760
and I also consult independently with

00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:16,880
teams where I help them design systems

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:22,070
and processes and sometimes I'm a

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:24,890
penguin if you are interested I urge you

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:27,470
to please submit to the SAS comp CFP it

00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,600
is open just because it has SAS in the

00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:31,880
title does not mean that we only accept

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,980
things with SAS it's the conference for

00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,660
front-end web development and really

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,360
just celebrating the SAS community and

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:41,480
our love of the preprocessor and we

00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,270
totally welcome talks that are perhaps

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,360
about post CSS or other things how else

00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:49,480
are we supposed to learn so thank you so

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,480
