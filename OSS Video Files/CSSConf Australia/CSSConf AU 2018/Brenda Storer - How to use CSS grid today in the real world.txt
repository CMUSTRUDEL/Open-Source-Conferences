Title: Brenda Storer - How to use CSS grid today in the real world
Publication date: 2018-04-10
Playlist: CSSConf AU 2018
Description: 
	The new CSS Grid specification is here! Sure, it’s fun to play with, but is it truly ready or even practical to use for everyday work? As a designer and front end developer at a software development agency, I've been using CSS Grid in production websites since its initial release to browsers in March 2017 and I’m a huge fan. It is already making my life easier.

In this talk, I’ll not only present live examples of CSS Grid used in production with examples of the different syntax, but I’ll also go over a bit of its backstory, its similarities and differences from Flexbox, and why unlike it's sibling Flexbox, its ready to use right away. I’ll show step by step how you can progressively enhance your site with CSS Grid and either write a bulletproof fallback for older browsers, or still use your existing grid framework as a fallback (yes, even Bootstrap), all with pure CSS, no JavaScript required!
