Title: Brenda Storer - How to use CSS grid today in the real world
Publication date: 2018-04-10
Playlist: CSSConf AU 2018
Description: 
	The new CSS Grid specification is here! Sure, it’s fun to play with, but is it truly ready or even practical to use for everyday work? As a designer and front end developer at a software development agency, I've been using CSS Grid in production websites since its initial release to browsers in March 2017 and I’m a huge fan. It is already making my life easier.

In this talk, I’ll not only present live examples of CSS Grid used in production with examples of the different syntax, but I’ll also go over a bit of its backstory, its similarities and differences from Flexbox, and why unlike it's sibling Flexbox, its ready to use right away. I’ll show step by step how you can progressively enhance your site with CSS Grid and either write a bulletproof fallback for older browsers, or still use your existing grid framework as a fallback (yes, even Bootstrap), all with pure CSS, no JavaScript required!

[Applause]

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,090
Wow Thank You Maura

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:20,950
thank you CSS comp my first conference

00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:25,570
ever tech conference was the very first

00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:27,760
CSS comp in Florida I think in 2013 so

00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,890
I'm just super honored to be here and

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,489
never been to Australia and I'm

00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:36,550
definitely coming back so I'm also super

00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,000
excited to geek out on grid with all of

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,190
you

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,230
I've been geeking out on it for like the

00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,149
past year year and a half

00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,440
basically Laura said everything you need

00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:47,890
to know about me I'd rather talk about

00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,239
grid than myself she also asked the

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,000
question I was gonna ask which is like

00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,590
who's using grid so I saw a couple hands

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,359
come up about using it in production

00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,890
anybody just kind of like toyed around

00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:04,420
but not really used it yet

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:06,940
okay one more hands cool cool so the

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,280
angle of this talk is very intentional I

00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,210
want to give you something that you can

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,770
take away and use right now I love going

00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,780
to conferences I love going to meetups I

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,729
love hearing about new things but I

00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,040
often go through something like this

00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:24,460
which maybe you've also experienced

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,650
which is you hear what the talk topic is

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,290
about you're kind of excited you're

00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,750
interested as you're learning about what

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,250
it is you're getting really excited

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,579
you're thinking about how you're gonna

00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:40,090
use it and then there's a point of like

00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:42,130
peak level excitement where it just

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,780
falls off a cliff and that's the minute

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,990
when browser compatibility is mentioned

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,990
and it turns into something like well

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,659
you know Safari has this but maybe in

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,200
five years you'd be able to use it so

00:01:52,659 --> 00:02:01,320
CSS gray does not like that we can have

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:04,360
nice things in CSS but grid is nice and

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,700
there's an it's intentionally nice it

00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,009
was rolled out in a way to try and avoid

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,420
that mess and so I just want to talk

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,100
about that a little bit because I think

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,510
it will give you some confidence and why

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,870
you can use it right now a little bit of

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:20,410
the history so grid was not rolled out

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,960
with vendor prefixes like flexbox its

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,810
sibling it was developed under

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,440
your flags so it's been worked on for

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,810
years in browsers but you can only use

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,250
it if you enable that in your browser

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:38,500
like personally through settings so it

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,210
wasn't able to be used in production but

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,500
it was able to be tested and iterated

00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:46,600
upon so what we end up getting like so

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,970
this is a little over a year ago on can

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,100
I use you can see there's like these

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,230
little green flags there saying oh this

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,360
feature exists it's just behind a future

00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:00,160
flag and then we go straight to like

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:04,210
green ready to go Naoko vets ready we'll

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:10,000
talk about I in a moment but today but

00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:14,110
so today this is at like 87% including

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,930
the vendor prefix version unprefixed 85%

00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,970
globally of browsers use grid and like

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,410
there's no exceptions really this is a

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,970
very well organized like browsers

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,480
cooperated with each other and it's a

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,070
pretty very few bugs exist in this like

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,380
this is ready to go now it was

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:36,760
intentionally shipped last March ready

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:39,550
to go out of the box but it's not so bad

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,030
so I kind of lied when I said it wasn't

00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,190
vendor prefixed the original version of

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,400
grid was actually made by Microsoft back

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:51,100
for Internet Explorer 10 in 2012 but

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,220
they abandoned it but it's really kind

00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,680
of a raw earlier version of what we have

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,780
now so it has some of the same syntax

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,110
and some of the same features but it's a

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,600
little different to people I'm gonna

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,090
mention all the time or Rachel Andrew

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,910
and Jen Simmons because they have just a

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,530
ton of amazing content about grid if you

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,540
want to learn things about it

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,650
they've been evangelizing in this for

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,989
years but Rachel Andrew really goes into

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:22,060
the difference in this article so at the

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,370
end by the way I have a link to all my

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,590
slides because I have like a million

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,660
links to resources because I could stand

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,070
up here and talk all day but I don't

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,900
have the time so I'm trying to give you

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:36,129
the resources so I don't want you to

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,369
worry about that

00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:43,509
I just mentioned it so you know it

00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:45,669
exists but what I'm gonna do is show you

00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:47,589
step by step how to write grid without

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,989
ever having to worry about the vendor

00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:53,289
prefixed version in Internet Explorer

00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:55,809
while providing bulletproof fallback for

00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:59,679
Internet Explorer or any browser that

00:04:55,809 --> 00:05:01,899
doesn't support grid and we're not even

00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:06,279
gonna need JavaScript or any external

00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:08,499
dependencies so but if you are looking

00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,409
for a little more like I'm gonna show

00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:15,459
some an example so you'll get to see

00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:18,399
some grid code in action but a good

00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:20,679
place to start is a new video series by

00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:24,309
Jenn Simmons that's on YouTube she talks

00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:25,809
about more than just grid but this video

00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:27,909
in particular is like a good starting

00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:31,209
point if you want to learn about grid

00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:34,559
and how it works so our example today in

00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:38,050
our step by step guide to grid oh

00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:41,019
actually first I just wanted to kind of

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,809
talk a little bit about flexbox versus

00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:48,550
grid because there seems to be a lot of

00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:50,469
conversation that's about well why do we

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,059
even need flexbox grid is replacing

00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:57,519
flexbox but that's not the case

00:05:54,059 --> 00:06:00,999
grid is just another tool in our tool

00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:04,479
set in CSS to use when it's appropriate

00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:06,099
and what makes it so powerful it's a

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,409
tool that we've been using the other

00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,629
tools that weren't made to do this to do

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,639
so now we finally have something that's

00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:17,619
made for these types of layouts that

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:23,319
we've been trying to not hack but by

00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:25,719
illusion make work for us so flex box

00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,909
has been like our iterative step towards

00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:31,569
that right so flex box is great for

00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:33,939
laying out items in rows or columns but

00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:35,529
even though it looks like a grid we

00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:37,599
still only have content flowing in one

00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:40,449
direction right it's just wrapping and

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,399
we have to tell it to wrap and we get

00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,550
into these kind of scenarios right where

00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:49,540
like every element needs to be perfectly

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,940
sized for us to make our layouts work

00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,340
we have to control our all the little

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,010
child elements to make sure that

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,660
everything works so what makes grid

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,760
different is it allows you to layout

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,840
elements in two directions rows and

00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:07,540
columns independent of each other so

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,030
besides positioning like absolute

00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,360
positioning we don't really have

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,110
anything where we can really set exactly

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,250
where we want something to be

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,920
independent of what's around it but

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,100
still not have it come out of the flow

00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,920
of the page and grid allows us to do

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,020
that and was built for that so the first

00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,840
kind of thing you might think of is like

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,060
this looks like every grid framework you

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,370
know like home page these are things you

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:41,590
can do with our website right like like

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:44,650
thick columns of rows and n columns but

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,830
I would advise you not to think of it

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:51,520
like that and think of it more like this

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:54,460
of lines of columns and rows and

00:07:51,520 --> 00:08:00,460
elements in the grid sit in between the

00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:01,810
lines so to complete step one when

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,670
normally reaching for layout property

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,920
like flexbox floats or positioning just

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,870
consider grid and give it a try and see

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,420
how it works and this is how I started

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,040
to kind of get into it and sometimes I'd

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,810
abandon it sometimes flexbox was

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,990
actually better for what I was trying to

00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,430
solve but it doesn't take much time to

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,880
give it a go and see how it works for

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:24,700
you so this is my little example this is

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:29,830
a little side project I did I'm gonna

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:33,120
pull up the real thing so this just you

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:36,870
enter a place and it gives you results

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,340
from foursquare of restaurants near that

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,660
location but it shows you like the

00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,410
future picture from there so this is

00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:46,300
like your typical use case for some type

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:51,130
of grid right a whole bunch of like

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,560
things in a row and let's go back to my

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,750
keynote

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,380
cool

00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:00,209
so this is the grid code for this

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,910
starting with the mark-up simplified so

00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:04,380
grid works a lot like flexbox everybody

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,620
how's everybody feel about flexbox

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:11,399
everybody use flexbox

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,500
yes okay great so grid works like flex

00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,470
box where it has a parent element that

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,149
you display grid and then it just

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,889
affects all its direct descendant

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:22,680
children and like fits them into that

00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:26,730
grid so here I've got a simple an

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,310
ordered list with list items and this is

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:33,149
all I had to write to complete that

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:36,029
layout four lines of CSS and what I

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:38,759
didn't show you before is that it's

00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:42,569
totally responsive without any media

00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:45,630
queries in in four lines and so

00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:47,370
basically what this is nice we can see

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,920
it both behind here so basically what

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,980
this is saying here without getting into

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,529
the nitty-gritty is hey everything

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:59,819
inside search results direct children I

00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:02,550
want you to be on a grid I want you to

00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:06,899
just browser figure out how many columns

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:11,970
you need fit them in but I want them to

00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:14,250
be at least 320 pixels wide if they need

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,899
to be bigger just make it however big it

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,839
needs to be to fit it evenly across the

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:21,269
screen and I want 10 pixels in between

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,509
each one and then 10 pixels around the

00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:28,199
edge of the whole thing so looking at

00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:31,920
that here like so the browser's thinking

00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:36,329
okay can I fit two across at 320 pixels

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:38,730
I can't I still can't but now I can and

00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:41,339
have the 10 pixels and then like you

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,930
continue to go and it just like does the

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,680
all this math that we've been doing for

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:49,920
ourselves for us because computers are

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,149
really good at math so it's about time

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,819
we like let the browser do that for us

00:10:53,149 --> 00:11:01,680
so that's exciting so if you want to

00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:04,110
learn more about those that specific the

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,939
specific values and the Fr unit just

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,670
like a fraction unit which is a new

00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:11,400
really powerful unit value

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:14,160
can check out some references there so

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,870
now the like really exciting part we can

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,510
just fall back gracefully using the

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,340
Future query and this will cover all of

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,040
our bases for browsers who don't know

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,560
grid so anybody like familiar with

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,960
future queries who's using future query

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:33,120
supports oh my gosh you're gonna be so

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:35,520
excited room okay so grid is the perfect

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,380
place to use this but I think we're

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,440
gonna be able to use this in so many new

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,620
things in the future that's like so a

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,560
future query is like a media query but

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:49,860
instead of saying a browser with you say

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,720
a CSS property and value and it checks

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,580
if the browser knows that and if it does

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,510
know what that is it'll run the code

00:11:53,580 --> 00:12:00,030
inside of it so here I've wrapped what I

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:04,710
did before the grid code in a feature

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:06,870
query and so they are pretty well

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,570
supported but what makes them perfect

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,150
for grid is that every browser that

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:15,240
supports grids supports a feature query

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:18,210
so it's perfectly fine to use so again

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,900
our little friend ie doesn't support

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:23,820
future query but that's okay because

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,530
we'll write our fallback which is just

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,300
whatever we would have done before grid

00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:33,960
in this case I'm just using flexbox and

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:36,090
I know this is small but I just have at

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,130
the top my fallback which is the Flex

00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:41,940
box and then right underneath I have my

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,300
future career with grid and then that's

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,550
it

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,620
so my browser like a browser like

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,600
Internet Explorer is going to read

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,680
search results at top display Flex

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,090
understands that it's going to get to

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,040
supports display grid and that's gonna

00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,290
be like I don't understand that and skip

00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,540
it whereas a browser like a newer

00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:03,690
version of Chrome or Firefox is just

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:06,690
going to override the earlier default

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:09,570
styles because of the Cascade to our

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:13,880
advantage it's just gonna override

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:16,230
what's above it so this is pretty solid

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,060
the only thing to really remember is

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,090
what I just said order matters have your

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,600
fallback first your grid code last so it

00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,190
can override the defaults

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,500
and then the only other thing to

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:30,040
consider was that there were like at the

00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,320
very bottom here I had to override some

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,590
of the things I was doing to the

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,350
children to make the Flex box work just

00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:41,950
like cancel out margin and make an auto

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:46,240
with but that's really not a lot of code

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:48,310
right few other considerations that are

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,420
just little gotchas I came across in the

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:55,330
past year autoprefixer grid now is

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,430
disabled by default an autoprefixer and

00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:01,330
that was voted on by the community

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:03,160
because for this very reason like let's

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,660
just not even deal with vendor prefixes

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,790
if we don't have to we have a fallback

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,970
and just let that work in the older

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,460
browsers so this is the default since

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,040
about June or greater but you can also

00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,750
set it in any older version of

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,420
autoprefixer in the config for

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,970
autoprefixer another gotcha that i've

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,800
personally come across because I work on

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:28,720
a lot of Ruby on Rails projects is that

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:31,690
SAS rails runs an old version of SAS

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,720
still that doesn't understand all of the

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:38,080
syntax so it'll still work but it

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,450
totally broke the test suite because it

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,310
was like your SAS messed up so I had to

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,410
find like some workarounds with that

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,390
that some of the syntax didn't work and

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,580
I have some examples of that but I

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:51,970
haven't come across any other problems

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:55,720
in any other stacks but that could be

00:14:51,970 --> 00:15:00,100
something that you run into that's it

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:04,930
like that's it so that's so easy and so

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,490
I I'm looking at time yes okay cuz I've

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,680
got some examples and I'm just gonna

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:12,300
kind of go through the examples in the

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,520
time that I have left and my disclaimer

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,640
is it's okay that when I look back on my

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,040
old code I sometimes say whatever was I

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,230
thinking that means I'm still learning

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,040
and growing I'm gonna show you some bad

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:31,150
code I wrote and I'm not scared about it

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,970
this is the best bad example so this is

00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:36,610
the first time I used grid in

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,500
a client project and this was like a

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,250
year and a half ago so before it even

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,870
shipped I was like this is gonna be fine

00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,540
but this is a good example of like what

00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:51,189
can CSS grid do that I really couldn't

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:53,019
do before and I'm using media query with

00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:54,550
grid here even though I know we kind of

00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,500
talked about maybe you don't need media

00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,220
queries but in this case it made sense

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:03,519
with what I was trying to accomplish and

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,689
I can also like control I'm controlling

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,060
the but here I'll just show you and then

00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:10,889
we'll talk about it

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:13,689
so I'm also using Firefox nightly

00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:17,050
because Firefox has the best grid of

00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:18,850
tools and I'm using nightly because I

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,279
want to try and get all the new stuff as

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,500
soon as it comes out so this is the

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,199
actual web site this is a client project

00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,199
I haven't worked on now for like a year

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:33,629
so that's also disclaimer yes

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:36,189
but this is like a basic blog for them

00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:38,230
like alongside their product offering

00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:39,970
and so this is like any standard index

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,610
page I've got a featured article and

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:45,850
then I have a list of articles and so

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,370
what was special was that I've got this

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,649
list of articles that's generated you

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:54,129
know in Ruby on Rails but then I have

00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:56,709
this little newsletter signup and so the

00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:58,689
request from the client was that we want

00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:01,120
a newsletter signup but we want it to be

00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:02,860
like kind of up in near the top and not

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,319
totally at the top and we want to kind

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:11,169
of integrate it in the list and so here

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,000
like as this becomes responsive it just

00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:14,500
kind of moves down a little bit but it's

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,020
kind of always staying to the right

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,350
that's where I wanted it to be but then

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,720
when we get to a smaller screen it just

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:27,360
goes to the bottom that is really long

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:31,090
that needs some pagination right so

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,850
what's going on under the hood here I'm

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,549
gonna make sure this is nice and big

00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:43,960
does that look okay okay

00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:46,539
so these dev tools are awesome so here

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,730
in Firefox nightly if I click this

00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:51,010
layout tab

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,410
see I've got a little grid thing here I

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:56,890
can just it'll show me any place any

00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:59,500
element that has grid on the page

00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:04,300
I can click on it and now it's given me

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:08,680
this whole like visual grid so I can

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:11,650
troubleshoot I can also like change the

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,980
color to make it something that I know

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:17,080
can stand out against my background I

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,520
can take away the line numbers but I

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,610
don't want to do that because they're

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,610
really helpful I can also then press

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:28,240
this little button here and it'll go to

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:30,100
the element in the inspector that I'm on

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,270
and then I can easily just go to rules

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,190
and see what's going on so likewise I

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:41,160
can press this and like turn on and off

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:45,130
that cool grid this is the waffle icon

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:49,450
also this is all coming for flexbox and

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:52,510
Firefox to this kind of inspector so one

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:56,260
thing that's I noticed like six months

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,920
later is like look at my grid code it's

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,110
broken

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:04,240
it's totally that's totally doesn't work

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:07,920
hold on actually I was fussing with it

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:14,470
and I made it right so let me reload

00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:16,780
there alert that's not valid CSS so I

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,370
only have display grid and grid gap 3m

00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,370
but I had this whole layout this is

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:24,490
working why is this working and it's

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,820
because I because the browser's are

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:31,510
smarter than me and grid is very

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:35,050
forgiving so my Dom has all of the

00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:37,810
articles and then at the very end that

00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,310
little subscribe widget right so that's

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:43,720
a subscribe widget

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:48,910
I am intentionally placing on grid

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:55,420
column 3 grid Row 2 right so grid column

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:57,820
3 grid Row 2 so the way this code is

00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,250
written is I'm saying just start here

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,920
and it knows to only take up one

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,440
we're like 1 grid area I could tell it

00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,070
to be bigger but in this case I just

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,110
wanted it to be that so grid was so

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,480
smart it's like Oh since you're placing

00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,850
something here I guess you want at least

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,910
three columns so I'm just gonna make you

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:23,840
three columns and so I have this wrapped

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:30,470
in a media query so that when we go down

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:33,400
to the two it switches to the next

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,400
column where to go

00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:51,950
subscribe should sacred column to okay

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:54,800
that's fine it just switches so I tell

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:58,060
it to go to like one more in between and

00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,830
again the browsers just being smart and

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,570
filling out everything else around it so

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,270
that's really nice and the reason why

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:09,380
that syntax is broken is because of what

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:12,950
I said before it was the repeat syntax

00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:17,360
which SAS rails didn't understand so

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:19,220
basically what I did was I tried to make

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,600
the layout work not totally

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,940
understanding what was going on with

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,650
grid and once it worked and didn't break

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,620
the test suite I was like cool I did it

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:30,110
but I didn't realize how I had done it

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,030
by stylizing that will subscribe thing

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:36,680
but one other thing I wanted to point

00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:41,210
out too I I did this in a code pen just

00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,620
to visualize it a little better one

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,460
thing I didn't think about the time was

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:49,580
accessibility so like I said the whole

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:55,520
Dom like it's all the articles are in

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:58,600
one order so if I'm tabbing through its

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,550
tabbing through the Dom order right so

00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,320
that's something we need to consider

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,780
with all this great power comes great

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,640
responsibility and we need to make sure

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,920
even when we're doing things that we

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,920
still make things accessible is this

00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:18,200
I'd love to talk about it I'm not sure I

00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:23,720
don't think it's the worst but it might

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:27,799
be so if you have an opinion about it

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:33,919
come find me at the party cool and so my

00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:37,460
next example is this was another client

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,109
where I just we had to rewrite their

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,609
home page because they were using react

00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:42,979
and then we didn't need to use react and

00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:46,220
then all the CSS was like written to be

00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:47,629
like just for react and so I had to

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,759
rewrite it but I took the opportunity

00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:51,859
then to make things better and one of

00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,279
the things that I did was this article

00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:57,710
like widget of five four articles plus

00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,679
the newsletter at the top here was

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,779
masonry and it was only placed on the

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:07,129
site that masonry was being used and it

00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:10,429
just felt like too heavy right that

00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:12,919
there was another way to do this so I

00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:16,039
thought well I can do grid for this and

00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:24,379
again I wrote this before grid had

00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:28,099
shipped completely but actually let's go

00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:29,749
to we'll go to - I have like a code pen

00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:34,549
of this one - which is a little easier

00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:36,259
to see so and I also have I have a code

00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:37,669
pen collection that I have a link to on

00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:39,950
my slides I just have a whole bunch of

00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:43,070
grid examples and the ones I'm showing

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,470
and then some more - so I mean also

00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:47,539
using SAS and this in this code pen but

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,929
this is also a cool example of one of

00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:53,419
the other ways to write grid syntax

00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,789
which I love which was the first thing

00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:58,669
that got me excited which is if you look

00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:04,039
like up here these like grid template

00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:07,399
areas like you just write it like how it

00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:11,330
looks how cool is that like it's like a

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:15,349
ski art in the in your CSS so I just

00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:19,369
basically here like declare my grid size

00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:23,500
so I have the columns and the rows and

00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:25,570
then I just say I give a name

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,870
for each space that I want something to

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:33,040
go in and then I tell it here I did it

00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:35,890
in this little sass loop I say grid a

00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,140
grid area to the name of the child and

00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:43,210
then like the number I want it to be and

00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:50,200
then it just places it so if I look at

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:54,340
this guy here so we've got and the

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,800
inspector tells us the names too good

00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:00,190
area names so I can help troubleshoot so

00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:05,140
these two grid areas make up the article

00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:07,120
one that was me and so in this case two

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,800
I ended up doing a float fallback

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,080
because since this was a larger client

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,700
and my an international client I just

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,670
thought if I'm gonna fall back let me

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,200
fall back all the way to something and

00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:25,150
it's a home page something that would

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:29,980
work everywhere cool then my last

00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:33,130
example is a prototype I made for a

00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:35,680
client of an article page that we ended

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,690
up not going with I loved it so much I

00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,210
want to like build my own personal blog

00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,850
so I can use it if I don't really want

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,020
to write articles know if you ever run

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,130
into that I always want to build a

00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:50,640
website for things but I don't

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:53,140
necessarily want to do the thing so this

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,760
this is just like a nice-looking article

00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,930
but what what I was trying to accomplish

00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,130
here was I want a background image

00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:03,160
that's gonna be a hundred percent

00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,770
vertical height of the browser but I

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,690
want it to just fill whatever space it

00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:10,690
can based on the size of the image it

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:13,720
could be any ratio any size and not

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:16,660
stretch all the way wide so like you can

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,520
see this like there's white space but

00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,490
when it's the right width then it

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:24,760
becomes responsive and I wanted to be

00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:27,070
okay with white space like we can have

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:31,060
white space it's so nice but clients

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:36,940
never think it's nice right and then I

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:37,710
wanted my article header to be flushed

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,540
to the body

00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,640
overlap but also be able to be any

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,290
height depending on the title of the

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,410
article and I want it to kind of like go

00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:48,760
to the edge right but like just overlap

00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:53,520
a little bit so there's some space over

00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:58,510
here and then I want my article to be

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,500
centered underneath it right so when you

00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:03,850
really think about like how to

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:07,630
accomplish that without grid I started

00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:12,910
to do this and I had some crazy Dom

00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:16,180
things going on because overlap things

00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:20,740
and and I just I couldn't make a nice

00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:22,780
clean HTML for this so I stripped that

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,220
down I wrote the HTML I wanted to in the

00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,530
way I felt like it should be presented

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,350
and then used grid to accomplish it so

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:34,210
this is what I ended up doing so I have

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:42,000
an article display grid so I've got

00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:45,490
three columns one F our min Max Auto 73

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,280
characters because I really want that

00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:51,550
column to be the middle column is the

00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:54,130
width of the body and I want that to be

00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:56,440
the text like 73 characters is a nice

00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:59,260
text readable length right feel like

00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,330
I've not been using that character unit

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,290
the way like that's such a that's so

00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,820
great that's and I'm always like

00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,770
counting it and figuring out how many MS

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,560
that is but character units are great

00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:11,380
and then I have two rows the first row

00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,910
is a hundred vertical height right for

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:17,430
the image and then the second rows just

00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:17,430
Auto however long that body content is

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:26,050
and so this is an example of like grid

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:32,410
column one through four is going all the

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:37,750
way across so this image is as wide as

00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:40,330
the entire man see this is one problem

00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:44,130
so it says why it is the entire screen

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,130
another way I could write that

00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:59,600
just to confuse you is you remember did

00:28:52,040 --> 00:29:05,650
we saw some negative numbers so let's

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:09,460
turn on my little wine numbers anyway

00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:13,160
here we go back

00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:17,360
I've got towards the bottom some

00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:22,700
negative numbers here so I can place

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,710
things based on the right side too and I

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,170
either can use positive numbers which

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,880
start in the top left corner or negative

00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,520
numbers start in the bottom right corner

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,870
and then go in the other direction so

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:41,090
that's also pretty powerful and cool all

00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:43,490
right so just to wrap up I have a

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:46,310
million resources and you should check

00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,470
all of these things out I want to

00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:50,780
specifically point out the top one from

00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:53,930
bootstrap to CSS grid Natalia Shelburne

00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:56,600
she works at New York Times and is using

00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:58,610
grid on the New York Times and has this

00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,010
great article about how like I think

00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,440
it's like eight lines of code that just

00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:06,050
cancels out any bootstrap and then and

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,430
uses it as a fallback and then she can

00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:11,540
have like grid for the other ways

00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,670
anything by Jen Simmons and Rachel

00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,590
Andrew is awesome I have a couple of

00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:19,490
things this is like an article I wrote

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:23,090
which is basically this talk and my code

00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:25,250
been collection of some examples and you

00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,590
can find my slides at my website or even

00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,210
more specifically here but if you want

00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:32,110
to talk about grid I could talk about

00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:36,290
grid all day come find me thank you

00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,290
[Applause]
