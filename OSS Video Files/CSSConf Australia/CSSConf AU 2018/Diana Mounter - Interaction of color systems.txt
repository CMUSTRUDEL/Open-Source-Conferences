Title: Diana Mounter - Interaction of color systems
Publication date: 2018-04-10
Playlist: CSSConf AU 2018
Description: 
	Color is the most relative medium in art. This fact makes working with color in design systems particularly challenging. Few people seem to want to claim to be an expert in color—perhaps because there’s an immensely deep amount to learn, or perhaps it’s because color is one of those things we hate to get wrong. Whatever the reason, color remains a contentious but often critical part of design.

I’ll be sharing my journey into color, from the technical challenges to how people respond to it. We’ll take a look at the efforts required in updating large scale web applications like Github, challenges in programatically generating colors, creating color naming conventions, color accessibility, and testing the interaction of color with other parts of a design system.

i I thought about dancing and I was like

00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:23,349
I know I look like my mum you know so

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:25,960
decided against that hi everyone thanks

00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:29,079
for coming after lunch hopefully you've

00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:33,390
had a good balance of coffee now to wake

00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:36,399
yourselves up and to hear about color so

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,860
I'm Dana also known as broccolini on

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,100
most of the Internet so if you want to

00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,870
follow my ramblings and see how much I

00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:50,160
love potatoes on Twitter that's how you

00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:50,160
can find me so I work from home

00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,510
so you know when people say what did

00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,330
your day look like this was pretty

00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,740
pretty accurate it was a half a cat say

00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,720
and that's what my day looks like I work

00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,750
at home because I work remotely for

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,490
github and they they have some

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,230
co-working spaces around the world but

00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,710
their offices are based in San Francisco

00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:18,140
and so yeah I get to I get to work from

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,450
home for github and hopefully most of

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,390
you know what github is or even better

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:27,680
use it if not happy to explain that to

00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:31,340
you later in the day so I work on design

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,220
systems and I've been working on design

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,710
systems at github for just over two

00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,290
years now and I wanted to start off by

00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,850
giving you a bit of a background about

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,710
what we've been doing for the last

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,910
couple of years before I get into the

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:49,280
meat of the talk about color so when I

00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,650
started at github we were on a version

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,160
for point something curve of primer

00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,660
which is the name of our design system

00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,810
it's open source if you want to check it

00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,729
out and when I started there were there

00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,940
were some problems that if you've worked

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:09,080
on design systems might seem familiar we

00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,820
had a lot of undocumented patterns there

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,570
was a lot of styles that didn't really

00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:17,870
promote reuse it was difficult to make

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,080
updates and things weren't really based

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,200
on systems and so over the last couple

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,330
of years we worked on updating our

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,270
documentation and flushing that out to

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,030
not just be how to implement styles but

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:35,120
information around that such as

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:37,010
accessibility guidelines information

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,100
around tooling for prototyping and

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:44,840
principles and things like that we also

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:47,990
moved prime it into a mono repo it was

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,490
all our components and styles were in

00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,250
their own individual repo so it was

00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,170
really difficult to make updates across

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,720
all of those so we moved that into a

00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:00,170
mono repo and used Learner to help us

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,060
manage making updates and publishing

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,940
them and all the versions at the

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:08,599
time we also did a lot of work on

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,300
consolidating patterns one of my one of

00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,069
the biggest pieces of work I did was

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,810
consolidating our box patterns if you've

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:17,060
used github a lot you might notice that

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,670
a lot of things are in boxes some of

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,160
those boxes have lists in them some of

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,450
them have had as exciting stuff but we

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,209
had seven different patterns and we

00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,830
didn't really need to have seven and

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,630
then we also introduced utilities and

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,549
variables they weren't they use SAS and

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,519
they weren't really making use of some

00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:40,160
of the advantages there and that stuff

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,819
was all based on systems so we started

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:47,540
to introduce things like typography and

00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:52,069
spacing scales and then in early 2017

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:54,319
came time to work on our color system so

00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:56,959
before I get into that I wanted to start

00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,130
with some of the challenges that are

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,099
presented when working on color so first

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,790
off color is subjective a lot of things

00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:10,209
influence how people respond to color

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,010
things like age mood personal background

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,400
can influence how someone feels and

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:19,970
responds to a color if any of you saw

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,919
and dropboxes Reeb and rebrand last year

00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,890
you may have seen some quite polarizing

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,780
responses and to that on Twitter some

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,760
people found it contemporary embolden

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,650
and they really liked it and other

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,810
people would say things like it hurts my

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,150
eyes like I can't deal with this so

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,190
that's just an example of how how people

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,030
can respond so differently to the same

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,430
thing there's also a huge amount to

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,810
learn I kind of really laughed at this

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,020
tweet because I could really relate to

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:51,169
it you can spend a huge amount of time

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,490
learning about color I'm like I know

00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:57,200
you've read it now cuz you're laughing I

00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:00,979
find myself saying that to other people

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,389
too it's like you know it takes a long

00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:04,610
time to learn about color you spend

00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,400
months and years and you still just feel

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,950
like you've barely scratched the surface

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,810
so when you go to learn about color

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:15,110
you're probably learning about things

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,849
like igb versus CMYK or if you've ever

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,879
tried to

00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:20,259
something that was in RGB format and the

00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,050
colors came out not quite how you

00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,899
expected and that's probably because she

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,149
hadn't converted to CMYK if you've

00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:29,860
worked in print like I did back in the

00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:32,349
day then you might be familiar with

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,580
Pantone and color matching they also

00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:38,919
make great mugs and this is a color type

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,169
that printers use I guess for like much

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,759
more precise colors if you really want

00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:46,330
to be accurate about how you're

00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,979
representing your brand and then you may

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,339
have learnt about the different color

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:52,509
stick games like triadic and

00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:54,699
complementary and things like that and

00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:57,759
there's even tools that help you work

00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:59,800
with color in that way like Adobe color

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:05,349
which actually used to be called cooler

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:09,699
which I think was a cooler name sorry I

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:11,949
really like bad puns and then let's have

00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:14,529
a look at color in design tools so this

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:17,969
is a some screenshots from figma and

00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:20,289
sketch and this this layout might look

00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:22,449
quite familiar to you even if you

00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,699
haven't used these particular tools it's

00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,680
very common for color to be represented

00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:29,919
in this kind of nice neat and tidy

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,579
square with with gradients these

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,189
actually use HSB stand which stands for

00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:37,269
hue saturation and brightness and to

00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:39,699
adjust the color

00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:41,860
if you've ever switched from a design

00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:44,199
tool to looking at color and with us

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,050
within things like inspector on the web

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,809
you might have noticed that they are in

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:53,409
HSL which stands for lightness and of

00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:56,579
course just for fun HS b and HS elves

00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:59,740
are not the same also by the way HSB is

00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:02,289
sometimes reference as HSB which stands

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,849
for value which is the same thing don't

00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:08,289
worry we're we're not going to spend too

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:11,949
long on this so so that's fun because

00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:15,579
they work differently HSL works by

00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:19,209
tinting colors with white whereas HSV or

00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:21,219
HSB works by tinting color alone so they

00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:22,509
work differently if you want to know

00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:24,279
more about that there's a great

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,559
Wikipedia article and there's also

00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,900
numerous Stack Overflow references about

00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:31,190
how to convert one

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:34,139
to another format so that could be fun

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,690
back to design tools this is probably

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,750
also another familiar way of

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:42,419
representing color to design tools like

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:46,289
to suggest that color can be represented

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:48,720
in a nice tight neat and tidy circle but

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:52,169
this can be misleading this is a

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,889
visualization from by Albert Albert

00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:58,710
Henry Munsell and it shows you that

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,990
actually fitting color into a nice neat

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,900
circle might not be very accurate it

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,419
could be misleading and it's you know

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,090
some hues have more range than others

00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:11,090
and so they sew that circle idea is

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,460
perhaps a bit of a problem

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:17,340
rune Madson he writes an online book

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,490
called programming design system kind of

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,370
kind of sums up really with the entire

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:28,229
history of color theory is neglected in

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:30,000
modern design tools so hoof we've been

00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:32,279
we haven't even started it on our design

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,620
system yet and we know that there's tons

00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:38,130
to learn maybe we'll never be an expert

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,890
and color tools are broken say that's

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:43,469
not so great but on the other side of

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,060
things there's tons to one eye I don't

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,980
know about you but I really like it when

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,620
there's just like this huge treasure

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,830
trove of things to learn from and as a

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,770
as a design systems worker I have also I

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,480
also have the opportunity to help make

00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,040
this easier for other people to learn

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,890
and that's something that I really enjoy

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,290
about working on design systems and if

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,150
that wasn't enough there's also some

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,209
opportunities for some great color puns

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,970
in your commit messages like I see red

00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:16,050
people and only orangey glad I updated

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,490
these variables so I really just did

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,300
those just so I could put those in this

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:26,190
dog so let's talk about actually

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:28,110
creating the system hopefully you start

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,930
off with asking yourself why are you

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,209
doing this and I think that's really

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,279
important a lot of people ask me where

00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:37,470
do I start what should I do with design

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,080
systems generally always that's like why

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:44,020
doing this what's most important for us

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,210
I github it was about making it easy to

00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,600
work with color with confidence and to

00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:51,310
do that successfully and that was really

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,990
really difficult when we had two

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,700
thousand four hundred and forty nine hex

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,090
values that were not connected in any

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,790
way that's not maintainable that's not

00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,260
easy to use consistently and so that's

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:07,620
what I was looking at when I when I

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:10,660
started to work on this so we had some

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,810
variables but they weren't necessarily

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,210
great very well named so like this one

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,460
for example doesn't promote reuse it

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,010
suggests that this variable can only be

00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,650
used for something called flash text the

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,210
yellowing but of course people used it

00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,520
anyway because they wanted that color

00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,640
value so they used it in things like the

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:34,990
file header which is not a flash text so

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:38,320
so that was fun another problem that we

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:41,500
had is with color contrast a lot of

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,600
common color combinations did not pass

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,070
which is a problems with accessibility

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,690
and then finally we were feeling like

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:53,920
some of our colors were feeling a little

00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:55,750
bit drab we lovingly named our blue

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,090
color that was used for links and things

00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,620
across the site dad jeans blue because

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,720
it literally looked like it was color

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,120
picked front from the actual picture of

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,770
the jeans here so it felt like it was

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:12,000
time for an update a bit of a refresh so

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:15,190
I get into actually building the palette

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,830
some of you may have noticed that we

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:21,460
updated the header to be dark gray

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:23,770
almost black and that work happened a

00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,730
month or so before I started working on

00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,760
the color system

00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,110
I didn't lead this work but and when I

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,660
saw that they were doing that and

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,840
knowing that we needed to work on our

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,480
colors I I've made some suggestions in

00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,520
that we make this more of a bluish tone

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,940
and so that we had a bit of a blue hue

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,710
in in the gray and to make it a little

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,610
bit darker than they were initially

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:52,179
going for so previously our darkest gray

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:55,119
was 333 and

00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:57,220
the problem with that is that that can

00:11:55,119 --> 00:12:00,189
get quite muddy looking and because it's

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,769
a warmer warmer hue as it gets lighter

00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:05,230
it gets a bit more yellowy and that kind

00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:06,519
of can end up feeling a little drab

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,999
which was something we were trying to

00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:13,359
get away from by using a gray color with

00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:16,329
with a blue hue that allowed us to keep

00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:19,209
our grades with a more cooler tone to

00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:22,179
them and away from that drab and also by

00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:24,579
making that dark our darkest gray

00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:26,230
slightly darker that gave us a small

00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:28,269
accessibility win because that would

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:34,269
mean it would work with slightly more

00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:36,189
color combinations and pass contrast so

00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:40,079
then I started to work on the blues and

00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:43,089
perhaps our most controversial color I

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,889
tried a lot of different iterations of

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:47,079
this before we landed on something that

00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:50,739
started to feel right some things were

00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:52,449
easy to kind of decide against because

00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:54,639
they didn't pass contrast or they felt

00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:58,569
to in that kind of drab dad jeans blue

00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,189
kind of realm but to make a final

00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,039
decision on this I needed to start

00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:05,799
testing our blues with other colors so I

00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,559
started to test and lay with our most

00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,600
common color combinations so that I

00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:14,139
could make sure it felt and looked good

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,179
and that it also passed color contrast

00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:18,549
so that for us with things like our

00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:21,329
light yellow which if you're familiar

00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:23,619
with github is used for a private repos

00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:25,269
like grey there's a lot of light gray

00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:29,619
backgrounds across the site and then

00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:31,569
blue on blue from there I started to

00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:34,209
flesh out the base colors of the pallet

00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:37,359
and to make decisions on those I also

00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:41,079
needed to flesh a flesh out the lighter

00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:43,600
and darker tones and because I knew

00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:45,519
certain colors like yellow is

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,209
particularly difficult to work with and

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,399
greens and oranges and they can maybe

00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:54,759
look like green can look to for SD or

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,649
orange can look to brownish so testing

00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:58,239
the different ranges of that was really

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:02,649
important in order to be able to decide

00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:04,560
on those base colors I also found it

00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:07,800
helpful to pry

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,900
no ties what I was testing things on so

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,720
I started to test colors on highly used

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:17,070
components iconic parts of the UI and

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,200
frequently visited pages I feel like if

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,210
anyone's watch the Design Systems Talk

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,589
you've probably buttons are always a

00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,650
part of that talk it's the most iconic

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:29,010
part of a design system someone once

00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:31,470
called me a button librarian actually so

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,170
here's my button slide obviously a very

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:37,050
iconic part very commonly used component

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,970
on github and most other websites and so

00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,660
that was one of the key things to test

00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:44,190
on also forget hub because we have

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,960
things like pull requests and issues

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,420
that have a status it was really

00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,150
important to check that those statuses

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:56,910
would still be represented meaningfully

00:14:51,150 --> 00:15:00,690
and with the new colors also flash

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:03,270
messages to represent error and warnings

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,640
I needed to make sure that these new hue

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,790
still still communicated that meet that

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,580
meaning I think it's easy and tempting

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,500
to go to a more sort of purpley sort of

00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,870
red color and that can come out feeling

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,089
quite pink and might not still feel that

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,070
kind of urgent this is there something

00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:26,120
wrong feeling so it was important to

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:29,130
test those and the contributions graph

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:33,720
whether we like it or not it is is a

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:35,790
very iconic visual from github and I was

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,560
actually really pleased that no one

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:41,540
really noticed that this got updated in

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:44,910
the in the big update of colors and

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:47,400
frequently visited pages obviously if

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:50,100
you use github the repo code view is one

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,480
of the most highly few pages so when I

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,160
started to test all those colors

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:59,880
together these are the sort of pages

00:15:53,160 --> 00:16:01,620
that I needed to make sure worked so

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,730
then I needed to test how colors really

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,770
were working in small parts of the UI

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,570
it's interesting that prop the proximity

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,970
of two colors close together can really

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:15,060
influence how they feel it took me quite

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:18,360
a while to find an orange that worked

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:21,690
well in close proximity to the blue it

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,870
the light gray background mass can also

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,560
affect color too and so the area that

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:33,300
the color takes up when we first shipped

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:35,579
the color updates the file icon was full

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,730
bright blue which you can see on the

00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:40,290
side here and that was one of them the

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,329
things that we got the most complaints

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,209
about people reacted pretty negatively

00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:47,250
to that and so we pulled that back to to

00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:50,820
a lighter gray it just felt like too

00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:53,579
much at the time and an accessibility

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,529
was talked about earlier it's important

00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:58,320
to test it the difference between colors

00:16:55,529 --> 00:17:00,149
it's easy for colors like red and orange

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,089
to get really close together and almost

00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:06,240
look the same and so I started to test

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:08,339
those with testing how they would appear

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,939
to people with color deficiencies that

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:14,280
was particularly important with our reds

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:17,270
and greens which we use to represent

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,459
code additions and deletions on the site

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:25,319
so I I needed to test her to make sure

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:27,390
that those colors still worked but also

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,360
really I think the important takeaway

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,850
for me was to not just rely on color

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,429
alone as much as possible have have text

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,679
labels and things like that that help

00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:40,049
display meaning if you're if you're

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,610
curious and the tool that I used for

00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:43,620
testing and which you can do in the

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,980
browser and it will update your whole

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,080
view is a tool called spectrum it's a

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,400
Google plugin and that's really handy

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:56,070
because it will just update the entire

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:58,710
page so working on on this started to

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,650
help me defined system rules

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:07,080
so I decided things like the base color

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:10,020
and for each hue needed to pass on white

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,500
or our darkest gray with a minimum of a

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:16,530
a large and then I also made sure that

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:20,130
the lightest and color darkest colors in

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:22,110
a hue together because often we want to

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,510
do things like with the error messages

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:29,130
and such where you want to use to a dark

00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:31,190
and light shade together working with

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,740
color and accessibility is challenging

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:37,010
it's often not the only consideration

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,500
you need to take into account I really

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:42,350
agree with this statement by Jennison

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,340
who spoke at a conference I went to a

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,919
few years back

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,510
he's the engineering manager for

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,610
accessibility at LinkedIn and he says

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,320
it's either accessible or it's not and

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,620
we have a standard that helps measure

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,289
this and I have to say our Green does

00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,950
not pass in all use cases it doesn't

00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:03,230
quite pass on on our buttons for example

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:06,140
but when we tried greens that passed it

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,539
felt like a huge huge departure from the

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,370
feeling of our UI and we felt like it

00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:14,570
was just a little bit too much at that

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:19,220
time recently you may have noticed that

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:21,440
we updated our labels and while unlike

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,840
the new labels when someone creates a

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,120
new repo they get a new set of default

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,490
labels so we can give them this new sort

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,549
of kind of beautiful looking colors but

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:33,919
they also pass we couldn't do anything

00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:36,520
about like the existing repos and we

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,539
changed the algorithm that matches the

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,730
foreground color with the background

00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:44,809
color to make sure that it passed six

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:46,580
color contrast and so some in some cases

00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:49,429
something that was once white then

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,350
became our dark gray and we found a lot

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:54,950
of people felt that it was harder to

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:57,049
read so it's difficult it's difficult to

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,120
make those calls you can make things and

00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:02,330
feel better for one group of people and

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,220
and not so great for others this is

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,960
something we have to consider with any

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,570
of our visual updates particularly on

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,490
design systems when we make sweeping

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,710
updates like changing all the colors or

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,169
earlier we've done things like changing

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,030
to system fonts we have to remember that

00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:19,809
some people use this every single day

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,460
and it can feel really really disruptive

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:24,470
and sometimes we may we're able to make

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,080
a decision to incrementally get there

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:29,150
and sometimes we have to kind of do it

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,620
all in one go and there's a lot of

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:35,210
factors that go into those decisions I

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:39,290
really like the idea of incremental

00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:42,720
correctness jamarat she did a podcast

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:45,960
recently called design design details

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,340
he works for Zeit some of you may know

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,800
about that and he talks about

00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,210
incrementally getting to correctness and

00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,100
I think that's what we've been trying to

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:58,710
do with things like color and other

00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:01,470
parts of our site so on the far right I

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:03,510
guess is our original button color and

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,670
the second one along is where we're at

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,790
now and hopefully will gradually move

00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:11,400
move it to something that passes yeah

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,350
blue would be a lot easier for us to

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,750
make that pass but that would feel quite

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:21,020
big feel like quite a big change and

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:23,520
github so we may or may not end up there

00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,840
so when I get into designing the API

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,070
because really everything in design

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,750
system she's designing an API for it and

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,720
so you can't really do that without

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,370
looking at naming conventions and

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,040
different systems will have names like

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,470
Roush booboo half I don't actually know

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,140
how to say all of these when I was

00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,660
leaving Etsy they had just introduced

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,400
and some new orange in cream shades and

00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:51,930
I honestly was like I'm not going to

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:54,780
remember creamsicle you may have seen

00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:57,300
and probably seen material design colors

00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,810
that use numbers to step between their

00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:03,480
values and they also have a huge amount

00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:06,000
of colors and so they have things like

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,810
green and light green and lime and stuff

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,150
like that US web standards and use kind

00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:15,930
of functional names like primary primary

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:18,660
darker as well as like hinting at the

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:21,030
shade and then this is from the carbon

00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,650
design system which this is interesting

00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,990
because it's using sort of a functional

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,080
name with like the number system to be

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,580
able to step through different shades

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,070
none of those necessarily right or wrong

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,600
you need to choose the sister than the

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,440
naming convention that works for you and

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:40,560
your team so for us it was about knowing

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,150
what colors what a color is by name so

00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,460
we wanted to stick with really simple

00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,960
names for colors and so staying away

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,410
from things like amber that could be

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,110
mistaken for yellow orange and we wanted

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,030
color names that would help people

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,160
internalize those color names and be

00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,260
easy to remember

00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,530
and we wanted to provide a good

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,240
vocabulary around talking about color so

00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,880
we went with something fairly similar to

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,330
material design except with a lot less

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,590
colors and a much simpler palette and we

00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,950
step through those shades with the

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:15,050
numbers I want to talk quickly about

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,940
variables and values and how we started

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:21,290
to introduce that system into our code

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,900
base so initially we had a few color

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,580
variables along with that flash text

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,310
yellow and stuff we had things like

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,810
background gray and text gray and as you

00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,330
might notice they their reference

00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,610
different hex values and so as we

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,650
started to introduce the system we would

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,810
introduce those color system variables

00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,000
into the existing I guess kind of

00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:44,950
functional variables that we had in our

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,890
code base that that doesn't necessarily

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:51,530
feel super great because it meant that

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,900
we had something that looked like it

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,000
might mean the same thing representing

00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,390
something different that translated to

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,910
our utilities and so if you were in the

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,040
markup and you wanted to match a text in

00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:08,000
the background color and you would have

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:11,960
to use differently named classes so that

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,280
doesn't feel great but if they were used

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,260
all over the place it would be difficult

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:20,900
to change that system straight away also

00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:24,740
we didn't necessarily need ten colors

00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:28,100
for all our 410 background Gray's or ten

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:31,970
text Gray's but if we looked at across

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:34,610
background text colors borders icons

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,710
illustrations we quickly used up all

00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:39,800
those ten variables so that's what we

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,300
ended up with so many so it's still man

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,370
it was easy to talk about color and

00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,080
pointer specific variables but yeah

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,350
maybe not so idea once they got to the

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:51,590
to the markup levels say yes still some

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,030
room for improvement there and then

00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,610
let's look a little bit about

00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,900
programming and

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,000
color I'm sure there's a lot of

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,400
developers here and you might look at

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,230
something like this and think can I just

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,300
like automatically generate this stuff

00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:07,990
and this is something that I started to

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:10,059
think about too I looked at the the

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,520
values for different colors and so in

00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:14,980
this example looking at blue and how the

00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,230
saturation changes from the darker to

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,650
lighter shades you can see that it gets

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,450
a lot more a lot more saturated as it

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,179
gets lighter and that's because you

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,360
can't really see the blue hue that well

00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:30,309
as it gets into the lighter shades

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:34,300
whereas with a gray for example overall

00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:36,640
its way less saturated and it's it bends

00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,920
slightly at but at the darker and

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,770
lighter shades so that that blue tint is

00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,420
is visible but if it's too blue in the

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,820
mid stage then it looks more blue than

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,900
grain you get into it into a hairy place

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:53,410
there and then let's look at hue so this

00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:55,870
is our orange scale and I've read some

00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,610
articles and things online some people

00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,260
say no you've got to keep the hue

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,059
exactly the same throughout the shades

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:04,480
otherwise it won't look like part of the

00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:06,670
same family I disagree with that I think

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,650
it's okay to bend the hue slightly at

00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:11,470
different and different ends of the

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:13,900
spectrum I found I needed to do that

00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:17,770
with certain colors too so for example

00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:20,080
stopping the the orange becoming too

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,480
brownish or too brick-red you might want

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,440
to tweak it one way or the other and it

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:30,610
also doesn't step up in the same in the

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,620
same way so it's not equal increments if

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,530
you've read interaction of color which

00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,570
my my talk steals its title from and you

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,730
may have come across a Weber fact no law

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,530
I hope you pronounce that right tell me

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,540
they didn't and this is about the

00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:46,330
relationship between actual change a

00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,550
perceived change I'm hoping that this

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,940
yeah it's a little hard to tell on these

00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:54,610
projectors but you can definitely easily

00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,470
look it up but in this example hopefully

00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:59,920
you can just about see that with the

00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:02,490
example on the far right the 1 2 3 4

00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,500
it looks like the 3 in the floor for

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,270
blending into each other whereas on and

00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,230
this example closer to me

00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:13,960
and it's stepping up in in in its

00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:16,660
doubling the amount in which is stepping

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,240
up but it looks it looks like it's equal

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,150
it's perceived as being equal so that's

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,430
an example where like program in color

00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:29,020
it's difficult because what is perceived

00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:30,520
is is hard to calculate however there

00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:33,550
are some things out there that you might

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,640
want to try and again in programming

00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:39,300
design systems byron madison and he has

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,240
this example where he's automatically

00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:45,610
generated the material design colors

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,740
using alert function and it's not

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,060
exactly the same as the material colors

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,740
you can you may be able to see the

00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,260
difference and you can color pick it on

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:56,200
the website but it's pretty close so

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,280
that might be good enough for you I also

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,480
like this site

00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:03,820
palek spy Brent Jackson um and this

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,830
steps rotates through the hue and uses

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,500
luminance to step up and down at the

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:11,230
lighter and darker scales of each each

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,600
color and I've used this on my personal

00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:15,220
site and this could be a good start and

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,100
then maybe you want to tweak and adjust

00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,260
your colors to your needs

00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,510
so programmatically generating color is

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,250
is not impossible it's just a little bit

00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,590
difficult sometimes to get exactly what

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,610
you want and but um it could be a good

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:32,290
place to start

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:36,810
and so wrapping up what happens when I

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:39,790
actually shipped this color change well

00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:41,620
this is the old and the new at the

00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,090
bottom I'm obviously I'm just so in the

00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,060
base of each color but it probably

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:49,060
doesn't look that different on this on

00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:51,190
this projector and you can maybe just

00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:54,310
about see that the the new colors are a

00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:57,630
little bit more a little bit brighter I

00:28:54,310 --> 00:29:00,640
in that in that shape I think I updated

00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:03,330
579 hex values that was quite a lot

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,890
there was actually 23% of our code base

00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:08,800
but what was interesting because I had

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:11,830
focused on commonly used components and

00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,290
frequently visited pages iconic parts of

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:18,010
the UI it actually felt like a lot more

00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:20,440
than that I guess I made around 80% it

00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,980
really felt like it was a big change

00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,830
we've updated a bit more than that since

00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,870
but there's still lots of old hex values

00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:32,049
floating around and so there's still

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:36,640
more work to do what did people think

00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:37,740
about this if you use Twitter and you

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,570
use github

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:44,200
whenever there's visual updates you

00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:52,090
might notice a flurry of tweets so some

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:54,460
people yeah so some people I color

00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,470
picked that just to check it was not the

00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,380
same as that as the blue that we had cuz

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:03,039
I had this kind of like cold sweat going

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,630
for me when I saw this tweet it's not I

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,059
should put the values up there to prove

00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,159
it so yeah some people a bit like the

00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:12,220
Dropbox ship some people found it like

00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,960
whoa this is really different this is

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,090
one of my this is my favorite tweet

00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,190
because I'm like I'm okay with it

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:21,070
feeling like this like if this is how

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:27,490
you can get her feels I'm like yeah hell

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:30,730
yeah so I guess in a nutshell you know

00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:34,090
color as Josef Albers said color is the

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:37,000
most relative medium in are working on

00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:39,820
color taught me that you know there's

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,070
only so much that we can control we can

00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,049
control the palette and we can we can

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,120
mostly control the composition we can't

00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:47,950
necessarily control all the data then

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,630
how that changes the composition of a

00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,789
page but we can control a lot of that

00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:54,279
and but when it comes to context and

00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:57,010
observation is that we're limited we

00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:58,840
can't tell if someone using our website

00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,330
we can't control if they have color

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,130
deficiency issues we can't control

00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:05,380
whether they have a really great monitor

00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,970
or not-so-great monitor we can't tell if

00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,149
they're looking at our website with sun

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:12,460
shining on the reflective surface so

00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:15,340
it's difficult but we can test for that

00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,899
stuff and that was a that was really

00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,149
important to Linus that we can test

00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:22,330
we're not going to get 100% coverage but

00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:24,490
we can get close and really like with

00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,799
anything in product development and

00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,020
design systems it's all about iteration

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,019
it's about iterating towards a better

00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:35,230
place we made

00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:37,570
our colors a lot easier for folks to use

00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:40,059
but for some people that was you know a

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:42,129
bit of a drastic change there's still

00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:43,720
work to do but we're getting there we're

00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:47,410
incrementally working towards

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:54,390
correctness thank you very much

00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:54,390
