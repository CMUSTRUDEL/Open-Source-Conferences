Title: Madlaina Kalunder - Building a raytracing engine with JavaScript
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: JSConf AU 2018
Description: 
	In this talk we will build a 3D ray tracer with Javascript. We learn about the basics of real time 3D graphics and what we need in order to produce realistic looking 3D graphics in the browser.

Itâ€™s fun to learn about 3D and graphics, plus seeing how a seemingly complex concept such as ray tracing can be broken down to simpler concepts is inspiring. I enjoyed the artistic aspect of using maths to make 3D objects appear in a browser - and demystifying it in the process of learning. I hope to show and inspire the audience to experiment.
