Description: 
	Metaphors are an essential means of communication and method of teaching for developers. Without them and Lin Clark, it would be much more difficult for teams to adopt Redux. But learning by association has its limits. When we only discuss the things we can relate to we reinforce existing stereotypes that box us in. Instead of thinking outside the box, we will discuss how thinking about the box itself is the key to breaking down our unconscious bias. Together we will learn how to dismantle the concepts that divide us, techniques for better engaging with people of all backgrounds, and how to empower the systems we work in to be even more performant than our code.

	I kind of want everybody to like loosenup so if everybody wants to get up we'regonna do a little dancecome on you go like starving it's gonnabe you let's celebrateI kinda want to just give a big round ofapplause to the organizers for doing anincredible job where you to like lift meor something can we give a big round ofapplause to the organizers[Applause]oh my god good turn oh okay thank you somuch for dancing I'm so honored to getto close out those last year's coughingit's so bittersweet that this is thelast time that this is all going to beput together but I'm sure that we'll allget together again soon my name isPatricia and I've had many many pastlives but for now I'm a front-enddeveloper and when I began teachingmyself JavaScript and when I gotinvolved in the JavaScript community Ifinally joined our beloved trash firethat is Twitter and the thing that Inoticed that was the most peculiar to mewas that there was this perennial debatethat kept happening about whether or nota hot dog was a sandwich and at first Iwas like is this just like in mymicrocosm of friends is this justsomething that I happen to be seeingbecause of like confirmation bias or islike and I was like no no becauseSilicon Valley just recently did a jokeabout it on their show they made an appcalled not hot dog where you could takea picture of something and it would tellyou if it was a hot dog or if it was nota hot dog and so in the show they take abunch of pictures of sandwiches andthey're like oh not a hot dog but thenthey take a picture of up talkingthey're like yep that's a hot dog so Istarted asking my friends what was goingon why was this debate happening why wasthis such a hot topic and that they toldme that the reason why it was because ofontology and I was like like metaphysicslike is this some kind of matrix memethat I'm not in on like what I don't forme ontology is like the study of thenature of being and reality so I wasvery confused they were like no no no nono this is ontology which is ininformation science which is the formalnaming and definition of typesproperties and interrelationships ofentities in a domain of discourse sobasically it's justfancy way of saying categorizingand so we use ontology and computerscience to limit complexity and organizeinformation but for me it was so forcedfor me I saw hot dog and like I was itmade my blood boil to hear this argumentover and over and over again because Ifelt like they were trying to stick around peg through a square hole and Iwas like you guys they're not oreverybody they're not hot dogs like hotdogs are not sandwiches hot dogs aremost like tacos like why can't you stoptalk like why are you still talkingabout sandwiches because it reallybothered me because what it demonstratedto me was the way that all of ourunconscious bias is used and manipulateseven our own minds when we don't realizeit to reinforce existing stereotypes andreinforce existing unconscious bias andexisting systems of oppression like thesandwich was invented by Earl ofSandwich in the his servant hate sees like those anywayshe asked his servant to give him hismeals between two pieces of bread andwhat happened was he would order thatfrom the gambling table and his friendswere like I'll have what sandwicheshaving like I just read that inquotations and I would really like toknow if that was what actually happenedor not but because then the When HarryMet Sally scene has a whole differentmeaning but so basically like I with thehelp of my friend Justin we like madethis meme to stop this debate because wewere just so tired of hearing itand Justin filled me in on this reallygreat book which is called surface inessence by Douglas Hofstadter andEmmanuel Sanders and it's all about howanalogies are the fuel and fire ofthinking and category they saycategorization is the pulsing pulsatingheartbeat of thought allowing us toexploit the rich storehouse of wisdomin our past and categorization gives usthe feeling of understanding a situationyou're in by providing a clearperspective on itallowing hidden items and qualities tobe detected future events to beanticipated and the consequences ofactions to be foreseen so by consideringhow we think we can get to the root ofunconscious bias which is stereotypes wehave to look at these broadgeneralizations that we use and arereinforcing unconscious bias and systemsof oppression through analogies andmetaphors that we use every day to bemore inclusive we have to consider howthese analogies are manipulating us andthese are the three most common waysthat analogies can be used to manipulatefirst they can be invisible so anythinglike like just seeing the word like anylanguage that you use has an invisibleanalogies in it a dictionary is nothingbut invisible analogies like how can youdefine a word without other words youneed analogies to do that also thesecond most common ways that analogiesmanipulate us is that they areinaccurate or that they lack nuance andthe last way is propaganda and thereason why I divided it into these threegroups is because the first one involvesno intent there is no intent on the sideof the person who is using the analogyor the metaphor to manipulate the intentis not there and therefore it should itwould be invisible because it can't bedetected the second example inaccurateor lacking nuance is an example of whenan analogy or metaphor is manipulatingus because of a negligence so like withthe hot dog and sandwich debate there isa negligence on the part of the peoplewho were arguing that hot dogs were likesandwiches to really consider whether ornot those categories were being fed tothem by all of their past knowledge orwhether they were actually going out oftheir way to figure out what was thebest way to categorize a hot dog and thelast way is obviously propagandaobviously has it intent itsthese analogies are meant to manipulateus and execute the agenda of the authorso we're mostly going to be focusing oninaccuracy lack of nuance andinvisibility and because metaphors aredangerous metaphors are not to betrifled with a single metaphor can givebirth to love this is one of my favoritequotations from The Unbearable Lightnessof being by Milan Kundera we need twometaphors are the stuff of life and weneed to be careful and question then inorder to bridge the gap between us andthe others the others that we don'tunderstand that we don't know how toconnect with Claude Steele is the authorof a book called whistling Vivaldi he'sa social psychologist and researcher atColumbia University and he wrote thisbook whistling Vivaldi about hisresearch into stereotypes and how theymanipulate us and how we can break themdown and whether or not they actuallyhave an effect on us and after many manyexperiments that were redone by manymany other social psychologists behindhim he used a kind of language that Ireally appreciated because I felt likeit got to the crux of the issue and thereason why we have so much difficultybridging this gap and tearing down ourunconscious bias and that's that heinverted the conversation for me soinstead of talking about privilege andinstead of talking about all of the waysthat we benefit which like privilege isnot bad privilege is not inherently badwhen we talk about privilege we'retalking about the things that you thatyou get that make your life easier we'renot talking about how you're costingsomeone else something it however thatdoes enter into the equation and that iswhy I think that there's so muchdifficulty understanding these conceptsand so I'd like you to take a moment andinvert these concepts in your thoughtand instead of thinking about privilegewhen you think about the inequalities inthe world think about stereotype threatwhich is what underrepresentedminorities experience it's a combinationof stigma pressure and identitycontingencies identity contingenciesexist for everyone when a white sis mailsigns up for a class on african-americanhistoryhe has an identity contingency that isgoing to create stigma pressure andtherefore will have a stereotype threatin that class so by inverting this Isorry excuse me I lost my voice on theplane so by inverting this andconsidering stereotype threat we can seethe conversation from the other point ofview so instead of subjugating us toinstead of talking about the things thatyou have to deal with when you're in asituation because you have a givensocial identity we should consider thecircumstances you have to deal withbecause as it underrepresented minorityI'm always aware of what other peoplecould think I'm always living in twodifferent worlds and we should put thedancing in here at this time it's reallyhard to talk for when you're losing your voice take aloss in real quick steel talks about inwhistling Vivaldi oh my god am I evergonna be able to finish this sentenceum the work of Edward Jones and RichardNesbitt and how they exploit explain howthese different things manifest in theworld and they explained it by talkingabout observers perspective and actorsperspective which is that so they talkabout observers perspective and actorsperspective and how observers emphasizewhat they can see and they D emphasizethings that they can't see they Demphasise how the systems of oppressionthat are not obvious to them and as anunderrepresented minority and the actorsperspective these are things that werehyper aware of these are things thatinfluence every single decision that wemake for example people talk a lot aboutmale chivalry but there's also femalechivalry which is this concept of likewomen being performative doing our hairbeing subversive you know putting onnice outfits like that is femalechivalry that is the actors perspectiveside of the equation that people don'tsee and when we can't see inequalitiesthey manifest more quickly and theymanifest the social socio-economicdisadvantage segregated social practicesand research of cultural orientationsthe other side of actors perspective isvery perfectly described here by W EBDubois in the soul of black folk whichwas published in recommend that everyone take a minute toread it but basically WB Dubois createdthis concept of double consciousnesswhich is that as an underrepresentedminority you're always aware of themultiple worlds that you exist in youexist in your own world of your ownidentities and that can be multifaceteddepending on your sexual orientationyour gender if you are ill or not andthis causes cognitive dissonance itmakes it more difficult to operate inthe world so and this leads me to likesomething elsethat is really important to me this issomething that happens on teams veryoften which is Ringelmann effect whichis where as the group grows individualproductivity drops and the reason whythis this affects URM is the most isbecause privilege works as socialcapital and it allows people to do whatis called social loafingso you see here TJ Miller is justenjoying a head off of a bong whileeverybody else is working around himright that's social loafing and whathappens is underrepresented minoritiespick up the slack so to reduce this fromhappening to keep this from happeningyou have to limit your scope of yourprojects you have to keep your groupssmall you have to divvy upresponsibilities equitably and you haveto reward coordination and cooperationand because people like getting credityou're gonna have a happier team a morepsychologically safe team at a bettercommunity is my lipstick okay soRingelmann effect is one thing that canhappen another thing that can happen iscalled bystander effect bystander effectwas researched by John Darley andbible-- atany in kitty Genovese a in she was attacked over the course of anentire the entire rest of the eveningand morning and the New York Timespublished that attack but in reality it was more likeabout a dozen people but imagine thatyou are out in the middle of the streetand someone attacks you and walk past and don't do anything about itand so this really inspired these twosocial researchers to look into why thiswas happening they did a number ofdifferent experiments one of myfavorites was the smoke room experimentwhere they put a person in a room with aquestionnaire and then they releasedsmoke into the room and they tested tosee how long it took before theyreported that there was smoke cominginto the room and as the group increasedas more people were in the room fillingout the survey the length of time thatit took to report what was happeningwhat up dramaticallyand that's because of diffusion ofresponsibility so what they noted wasthey with bystander of fact what happensis you notice interpret assess degree ofresponsibility form assistance andimplement an action choice and thataction choice can be direct interventiondetour intervention or no interventionand biased prevents people from directlyhelping those that need help fromdirectly to helping people thatabsolutely could be advantaged by theprivilege that you can offer so theyDarley and let found that responsibilitydepends on whether or not we feel thatthe person who needs helpdeserves it our competence and ourrelationship to them and detour responsedetour intervention doesn't work insituations of bias because the systemsof oppression that already exist don'tallow for help so how do we do effectivedirect intervention how do we help thepeople who need to be helped in thein the subways it was practically unsafeto go on the subway but thisorganization called the guardian angelscame together and it was theirmembership was mostly young men blackand Latino who had a skewed gang life intheir own neighborhoods to better theircity they had this system that I lovedit was fantastic what they did was theyput one person on each subway car and ifa fight broke out or if someone gotattacked on a subway car they would knowbecause at every subway stop they allpoked their heads out the subway doorand check to make sure that everyone wasvisible and if someone wasn't visiblethey would know that the person in thatsubway car needed assistance and theywould all run to that subway car to helpthey did this despite the fact that thepolice was we're calling them vigilantesdespite the fact that they were at firstshunned by many and over time becausethey helped so many people the attitudeof the public turned around in a fewyears the public was able to go on thesubway safely they were able to enjoythey're City again and it is because ofthe guardian angels that the subway gotcleaned up in the direct intervention that worked despitea system of oppression not helping issomething that was described on replyall's writing on the wall episode atColgate University in upstate New Yorkthe Black Student Union leaders weregetting direct death threats through theanonymous messaging app Yik yak and theadministration of the school refused todo anything about it they refused tocontact yak and ask them about thepeople who were posting these deaththreats they refused to do anypunishment when they found out who thesepeople were and so what happened wasassistant professor of biology JeffHolmes started this campaign that hecalled the Yik yak take-back and it wasa social media campaign akin to sendingNed Flanders to comment on rules were that professors needed to goon and all they had to do was sign theirname but what they and he encouragedthem to post messages of well-wishesmessages about joking about how hard themidterm was gonna be broadcastingcongratulations to students on theirfinal fun finishing their thesis andwhat he did was by witnessing by usinghis privilege he witnessed these deaththreats and it created this environmentwhere it was no longer a place where itwas acceptable to post these kinds ofmessages because the professor's gotinvolved and they directly intervened wehave to get directly involved to makechange and we have to recognize when anunderrepresented minority points out badbehavior we are challenging you to bebetter if we felt that your intent wasmalicious or bad in any way shape orform I promise youunderrepresented minorities are going todisengage they're going to block you onsocial media they're not going to risktheir own safety to tell you that theythink that you were wrong when we feelthat we're in danger weyou know to tendin to be friend we knowto go to our groups because the group ismore likely to survive harassment thanan individual but when we see badbehavior and we trust that the personhas good intentions we're going to callit out and when it gets called out it'sbest if you listen internalize apologizebe accountable for your actions and beattentive to the ways that that was partof your unconscious bias so that you cantake it out of your unconscious bias sothat you can be conscious of thosemoments because we care too much to stopdemanding more this is a matter of oursafety this isn't a matter of our whatwe'd like to do and what we don't liketo do I don't like having to confront myfriends when they say somethinginappropriate I don't like having toconfront people on Twitter about acomment or a word that was used that wasa ballistait's what we need to do in order to makea better society each choice is anopportunity to influence the world thatwe exist in Sartre when he wrote onBeing and Nothingnesswrote notes about creating an ethicalmodel to pair with his existentialphilosophy but he never got beyond notesSimone de Beauvoir did she wrote ethicsof ambiguity which perfectlyencapsulates its I looked for years foran ethical model that I felt matchedwhat I was internally feeling because Iknow that there's nothing new Under theSun and someone must have written it andwhat's fascinating to me is that herbook isn't even mentioned on Wikipedia'spage for existentialism it's a directresponse to on being in nothingness it'snot mentioned in most philosophycurriculums but she wrote about howbecause we have freedom Eden and becauseof existentialism because of the factthat likes Archer killed God andbasically said that it's our choices areour own it means that we have our ownresponsibility to make our own choicesin each and every moment in order tohelp not just ourselves but the societythat we choose to participate inparticipating in society social contractis a choiceand therefore because social contract isa choice it is imperative that a moralattitude be adopted as well so afterdiscussing all of this high-end likesocial theory let's look at anotherexample or unconscious bias exist sohere's an analogy that's so pervasivethat we usually wouldn't think blinktight twice but you might not have knownthis but actually before the compass wasinvented East used to be at the top ofthe map because the Sun would rise inthe east and so maps were oriented withEast at the top but when you see thisanalogy that west to east is equal toleft-to-right your mind doesn't thinkabout it it's an invisible analogy andhow does like how does this apply to usas developers why man honestly the WestWing does a much better job ofexplaining this than I do so partly toaggressively support legislation thatwould make it mandatory for every publicschool in America to teach geographyusing the Peters projection map insteadof the traditional Mercator give me bucks and it's done reallyNo why are we changing maps because CJthe Mercator projection has fosteredEuropean imperialist attitudes forcenturies and created an ethnic biasagainst a third world really the germancartographer Mercator originallydesigned this map in navigational tool for European sailorsthe map enlarges areas at the poles tocreate straight lines of constantbearing or geographic direction so itmakes it easier to cross an ocean butyes it distorts the relative size ofnations and continents are you sayingthe map is wrong oh dear yes now look atGreenland okay now look at Africaokay you two land masses appear to beroughly the same size yeswhat a blow your mind if I told you thatAfrica is in reality here we have Europe drawn considerablylarger than South America when it's sixpoint nine million square miles SouthAmerica is almost doublethe size of Europe's appears three times as large as Mexicowhen Mexico is larger by square milesGermany appears in the middle of the maponce in the northernmost quarter of theearth-boyrelative size is one thing but you'retelling me that Germany isn't where wethink it is nothing is where you thinkit is where is it I'm glad you asked itthe Peters projectionit has fidelity of access fidelity ofposition east-west lines are paralleland intersect north-south axes at rightangles what tell is that it's whereyou've been living this whole timeshould we continue so you're probablywondering what all of this has to dowith social equality no I'm wonderingwhere France really is guys we want tothank you very much for coming in hangon we're gonna finish this what do mapshave to do with social equality youasked she askedSalvatore Anatoly of the NationalCouncil for social studies argues in oursociety we unconsciously equate sizewith importance and even power I'm gonnacheck in on Tommy go these guys finebring it in on that map he'll call meright probably not okaywhen third world countries aremisrepresented they're likely to bevalued less when we're cater mapsexaggerate the importance of Westerncivilization when the top of the map isgiven him northern hemisphere and thebottom is given to the southern thenpeople will tend to adopt top and bottomattitudes but wait huh world's could youput the northern hemisphere but on thetop on the bottom how like this yeah butyou can't do that why not cuz it'sfreaking me outwho doesn't love CJ Cregg so this is theGail Peters projection that they showedthe previous map was the Mercatorprojection and Peters came up with hedescribed his reasoning for working onthis as because he saw that the Mercatorprojection was like the cartographicimperialism of the time however any mapthat lays flat is naturally distortedeven this projection is distorted so I'mnot even going to show you what it wouldlook like upside down because I don'twant to freak you out any more than youprobably already are but as in politicsall identities are local and I say thatbecause as developers one of the thingsthat we work with the most is actuallyMaps it's how I got started developing Ijoined map time LA and worked on mapmapping projects with open street mapsand in the open street map communitythey call the Google map strategy theStarbucks test which is that they onlyinvest money into mapping when it'sclose enough to it's a closed radius toa chain coffee store and expertsestimate that and so like OpenStreetMapsdoes this work to map in areas that areless accessible but experts estimate thetwo to five percent of OpenStreetMapcontributors are women only two to fivepercent but the humanitarianOpenStreetMap steam did a genderequality study recently that found thatremote mappers in under service parts ofthe world and when working directly withpeople from communities in desperateareas forty-eight percent were womenthat's practically that's equality fortyeight percent is equality but keep inmind that the barrier of entry for thesewomen is much higher these are in partsof the world where the gender norms meanthat the women have much more work thatthey have to do on top of that they'revolunteering their own personal time togo in math in crisises in puerto rico intat and tasmania in africa like theseare people who they could be puttingtheir time towardstheir own personal lives but insteadthey volunteer it because mapping isabout navigating the world safely andfor women in developing countries thatsafety is harder to secure and we canmake a better more inclusive internet byworking on breaking out of thesecategories that we don't even see thatare around us breaking out of theseboxes and questioning the things thatthe analogies and the words and the waysthat we talk about the world around usand taking a look taking a really hardlook at ourselves and considering howunconscious bias plays into our lifebecause how can we constantly talk aboutour love of problem-solving which to meis the soul of engineering and not wantto solve the interpersonal problems onour team and in the world at largefor me it's the reason why I do thiswork the reason why I do workshops onintersectionality and inclusivity thereason why I give talks aboutunconscious bias is because as much funas it is to solve a bug these are theproblems that are affecting people'slives directly and these are the issuesthat really need to be solvedfirst and foremost so I hope that thatinspired you to take a look at yourlives and thank you so much jazz cafe'oh thank youyouyou
