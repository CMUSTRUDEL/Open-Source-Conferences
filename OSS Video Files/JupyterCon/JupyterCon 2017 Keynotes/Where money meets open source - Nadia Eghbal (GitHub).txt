Publication date: 2020-08-24
Playlist: JupyterCon 2017 Keynotes
Description: 
	We know money has an important role to play in open source, but where does it help and where does it fall short? Nadia Eghbal explores how money can support open source development without changing its incentivesâ€”especially when grants are involved.

	00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,390
so today I want to talk about what money

00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,620
can buy what money can't buy and how we

00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,400
should think about the role of money in

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,050
open source

00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,809
you've probably heard people talk about

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,030
underfunded projects and open source but

00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:16,820
for starters let's try to imagine the

00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,279
impossible you're a project with a lot

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,190
of money to spend maybe through grants

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,369
or through donations how do you spend

00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,019
all that money I think is an important

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:29,000
question to ask because if we can't

00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:30,910
answer this question why bother talking

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,710
about money and open source at all

00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,530
why bother asking for donations or

00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,149
contracts or sponsorships and so that's

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,379
what I want to talk about today how

00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:44,239
should we think about the role of money

00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:45,379
in an open source ecosystem so money is

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,719
historically had a contentious

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,920
relationship with open source on the one

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,139
hand you hear people talking about

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,149
underfunded projects and on the other

00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:54,319
hand you hear people saying money ruins

00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:56,780
everything and we shouldn't pay for

00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:58,459
anything at all both of these things

00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,629
have some truth to them and that's

00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,889
partly because there are different

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,199
incentives that drive open source

00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:05,089
contributions so if we're gonna answer

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,280
this question of how do we spend money

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,310
in open source we have to start by

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,869
asking why do people contribute to open

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:17,539
source in the first place turns out

00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:20,299
people contribute to open source for a

00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:23,590
lot of reasons I'm gonna go through a

00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,590
couple that might sound familiar to you

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,509
the first is wanting to solve a problem

00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:31,009
this is a true intrinsic motivation and

00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:33,799
it's especially relevant in the earliest

00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,420
stages of an open source project so your

00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,369
first contribution are when you first

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,869
open source of projects these things

00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:42,170
often happen because someone wanted to

00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,549
solve their own problem for casual

00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,409
contributions this is by far the most

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,240
common reason and these one-time

00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:50,799
contributions make up nearly half of all

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,799
contributors to top projects on github

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,840
second is reputation based so if that

00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,060
first-time contributor keeps coming back

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,429
they might find that reputation becomes

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,420
a good reason for sticking around

00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:04,249
whether we like it or not open source

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,810
has become a public resume of sorts and

00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,219
some people find that contributing to

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,269
open source helps improve their hire

00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:10,269
ability or their earning power

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,420
third one is community for regular and

00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,590
longer-term contributors another reason

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,640
why they stick around is because they

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,459
feel like they're part of something

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,900
bigger than themselves sometimes finding

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:29,060
the right open source project feels like

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:31,459
finding your community and finally some

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,579
people contribute once twice or for many

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,299
years just because they think it's fun

00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:36,739
open source could be a welcome

00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:39,260
distraction from work or from day-to-day

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,000
life and so these are some of the most

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,610
common reasons that I've seen why people

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,349
contribute to open source but another

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,950
thing to consider is that these

00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:50,780
incentives can change over time and so

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,400
you might actually resonate with this if

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,950
we think about the process of going from

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,989
using a project for the first time to

00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,370
making your first contribution to

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,019
contributing regularly or even

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,519
maintaining your projects it seems

00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:04,120
obvious that you're the reasons why you

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,079
say there might change over time so

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,640
while someone might contribute to the

00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:09,590
first time because they want to solve

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,019
their own problem maybe the community is

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,280
why they end up sticking around I swear

00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,170
I wrote this program I talked before I

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,440
learned that uh there's this famous

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,730
quote go around boom vet cannon about he

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,380
came for the language and he stayed for

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,609
the community if parents made it into

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,569
two other keynotes so I'm gonna make it

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:25,340
a third

00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:27,109
but that's textbook example of what I'm

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,940
talking about here coming from language

00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:31,430
thanks the community Thank You Brett for

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,079
being my example anyway so this is a

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,150
especially interesting for a maintainer

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,010
because reputation will benefit maxes

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,819
out over time

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,319
so it might have been really beneficial

00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:42,109
to be known as a project maintainer

00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,970
early on but at some point even if you

00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,099
step down you'll probably still be known

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,209
for having mentee in that project so

00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:50,180
you'll need another reason to stick

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:51,889
around and so recognizing is important

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,629
if you want to spend money smartly an

00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:57,650
open source we need to start by meeting

00:03:53,629 --> 00:04:00,590
people where they're at and thing is

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,699
where they're at is often fine a lot of

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,560
these incentives are actually working

00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,109
pretty well and that's a really good

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,609
thing so for example a first-time

00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:09,319
contributor doesn't really need a

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:11,840
financial incentive to make that

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,579
contribution they might need help figure

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,379
out how to make a contribution but

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:16,699
that's different for the sniffing they

00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:20,539
give them motivation that's more about

00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:22,700
reducing friction and so instead of

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:23,990
replacing people's motivations we should

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,639
think about using money to help people

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,099
do what they already feel motivated

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,539
do we're talking about that person who

00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:31,219
wants to make a first-time contribution

00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:33,409
they may be intimidated and they don't

00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:34,550
know how so you can use money to host a

00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:38,900
workshop that would make that experience

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,219
more welcoming so back to our

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,379
hypothetical open source project with

00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:43,460
way too much money to spend now that we

00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,599
understand contributor and centers a

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,310
little bit better how should that

00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:50,960
project think about spending money I'm

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,639
going to go through different stages of

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,800
an open source project and talk about

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,180
the role that money can play throughout

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,699
so first we have creating the projects

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,050
and then we have finding users and then

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,060
it's about turning those users into

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,990
contributors and finally the longer-term

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,919
maintenance aspects of our projects so

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,900
firstly we have to create a project

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,330
right which we can think of as a project

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,669
startup costs I put creation in the

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,990
beginning but creation obviously happens

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,020
throughout the life of our project with

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,279
major new features and improvements

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,900
these new ideas tend to come from

00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,789
intrinsic motivations like wanting to

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,870
solve an interesting problem the

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,839
difference is they can take a lot of

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,770
time to implement all in one go while

00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:30,020
this work can be done without any

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,909
funding at all funding someone to spend

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,349
dedicated time on a project on a problem

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:35,349
makes the solution more likely to happen

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,379
example of how funding helps people

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,879
create comes from the origin story of

00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,099
post juice which is spatial mapping

00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,770
software Paul Ramsey who is a maintainer

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:47,689
of Hostess notes that while they did

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,219
create the first prototype for free it

00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:50,810
was actually another interested person

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:53,419
who got government funding that led to

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,889
the first release this is an example of

00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,750
the hidden role that funding can play

00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:59,839
because Paul notes that most people

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,399
don't know this is the actual story /

00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,029
example this was fun awesome which ran

00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:07,610
what I believe is the biggest software

00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:09,349
Kickstarter campaign to date Sean

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,610
Awesome has been around for a while but

00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,289
they recently wanted to make major

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,969
updates and improvements so the crowd

00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:19,159
funded just over a million dollars for

00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:20,860
that purpose so now that we made a

00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:23,180
project we have to find people to use it

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,039
at this stage people are likely to be

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,810
motivated by a sense of community so you

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,509
can use money to empower other people to

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,339
spread the word so sponsoring community

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,620
events like meetups conference travel

00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:36,080
swag all that stuff can help expose more

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,580
people to a project and since a lot of

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,800
new contributors start out as users

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,480
expanding your total number of views

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,950
also helps to expand the potential group

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,180
of contributors great example lists are

00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,220
these challenge coins from a project

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,930
called B where they gave these coins

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,790
away to people who contributed to the

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,280
project at a conference and it turned

00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,380
out to be pretty good advertising to

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,610
help fund the the coins creation B we're

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:03,770
asked a couple of companies to sponsor

00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:06,110
them so they've got users it's about

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,360
converting those users into first-time

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,070
contributors as we've learned most

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,350
first-time contributors already wants to

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,610
contribute for their own reasons so this

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,410
is more about paying for things that

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,360
make it easier for them to do so that's

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,960
stuff like in prison sprints workshops

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,700
maintainer meetups recent example is

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,380
from gopher con earlier this year so

00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,210
jess frisselle who's on the go team

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,250
noted that they had this contributor

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,080
workshop and from there she learned the

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,630
feedback they got was that I learned how

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,830
approachable the go team is someone else

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,240
responded saying yes

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,830
having never met any of these people

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:43,490
before they made contributing feel

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:45,500
significantly less scary so file stage

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,790
is maintaining once we move into long

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,660
term maintenance spending money becomes

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,820
a little bit trickier

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,740
and so if paying for creation is like

00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,720
paying for start-up costs you can think

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,090
of maintaining as the overhead costs of

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,620
her projects it takes time to review

00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,060
other people's contributions answer

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,270
people's questions and just generally

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,590
keep the project together but it's not

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,570
quite as easy as just paying every

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,210
maintainer because of again these

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,190
personal motivations people maintain

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,840
projects for different reasons some

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,370
people enjoy open source as a hobby

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,620
other people want to maintain their

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,450
projects for full-time work both of

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,040
these things can be true it's just about

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,540
understanding that person and their

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,720
individual needs before throwing money

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,280
at them also add that for the creation

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,080
and the maintenance stages there's also

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,030
more indirect ways to fund this kind of

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,290
work like asking your employer for

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,290
dedicated time to work on a project

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,940
example is comes from around hammer who

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,969
uses patreon to fund his maintenance

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,860
work on happy jeaious and as he points

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,050
out happy community is actually doing

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,310
quite well he says that there are a lot

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,230
of community members who contribute

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,580
their time and their resources but

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,860
that's different from the maintenance

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,180
work of happy which in his mind is

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,060
things like reading every issue

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,040
reviewing all pull requests and commits

00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,510
answering complex questions and so the

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,010
committee contributions are separate

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,230
from that kind of maintenance work and

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,790
when we talk about underfunded projects

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,410
what we're usually talking about are

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,410
paying for these kinds of overhead costs

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,670
one of my favorite analogies for this

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,779
comes from the nonprofit sector you have

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,190
plenty of people who volunteer their

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:18,500
time at a nonprofit for altruistic

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,990
reasons let's say picking up trash or

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,790
spending time an animal shelter that

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,440
base of volunteers doesn't need a

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,700
financial incentive to contribute in

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,820
fact some of them might be insulted if

00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,770
you tried to pay them on the other hand

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,660
most nonprofits still need paid staff

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,880
right because someone needs to

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,170
coordinate all those volunteers and when

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,300
you're spending endless hours and that

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,270
kind of overhead work altruism is

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,680
probably not going to keep you there

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,480
it's not necessarily a bad thing it just

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,430
means that projects have different roles

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,860
with different kinds of incentives and

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,899
money can help support them it's about

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:56,300
using money to introduce it to the right

00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:57,860
person at the right time one thing I

00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,540
hope you'll take away from this is that

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,910
money doesn't replace community

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,260
contributions projects still need

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:08,060
engaged contributors and welcoming

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:10,520
communities to keep them alive at the

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,200
same time money equals resources and

00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,880
when you have the resources you can use

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,890
that friction you can use that to reduce

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,820
friction and help people do the things

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,770
that they already feel motivated to do

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:27,830
that's like

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:27,830
