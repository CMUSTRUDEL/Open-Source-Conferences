	00:00:00,579 --> 00:00:04,819
today we're going to talk about what are

00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:10,160
the things that are driving the adoption

00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:12,650
of Jupiter in the enterprise it's funny

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,010
because the the last tuck you hear the

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,590
the analogies are very close I think

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,570
if you look across the private sector

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,660
and public sector and research

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,730
departments we're all working towards a

00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,120
common goal how do you collaborate with

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,640
other people how do you deliver smarter

00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,160
better analysis faster and I think

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,230
there's a very common lineage between

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,910
all the teams that are working on this

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:43,160
you know regardless of the sector that

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:45,770
they're in so it's exciting to see my my

00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,400
journey in data science is probably a

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:53,060
little different than some I got my

00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:57,050
first taste of using data science when I

00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,899
was at Yahoo I was fresh your - out of

00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,730
my MBA program and was very good at

00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,970
Excel and you know could do some basic

00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:08,270
sequel but I had never interacted with

00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:12,440
anything that had to build a forecast or

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,610
build a model really and the the team I

00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,409
was working with at that time was

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,020
working on something new they said hey

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,159
we've got you know this great data

00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,010
coming out of our search infrastructure

00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,110
and we're trying to find customers for

00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:27,740
that data what can you guys do with it

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,290
and there was obviously a big competitor

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,570
that we were looking at at that time

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,970
that was in Mountain View and we were

00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,810
trying to understand how are they

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,430
performing in the display market and how

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,000
were they doing in terms of search

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:46,340
monetization relative to us and there

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,860
was really no way to tackle that problem

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,960
at scale given the size of the data

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,880
because basically what we wanted to do

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,850
is look at the entire internet and say

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,150
how are they doing how far penetrated

00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,580
are they in the publisher ecosystem we

00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,500
wanted to look at every single piece of

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,409
search data and say how are they

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,090
monetizing it so the team had to invent

00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,020
something and that that thing they

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:14,170
invented was Hadoop and

00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,300
the teams that were doing the data

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,710
science work back then weren't actually

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,740
called data scientists they were called

00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,670
you know data strategists or R&D

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:27,340
specialists or strategic data services

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,620
but the the goal was clear we need to

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,430
understand how to interpret these large

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,320
data sets build a model understand our

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,450
position and relative of the competition

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,030
so it's really exciting to see that that

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,710
was possible and we used open source

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,360
tools and you know an open source tool

00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,280
is built around that there were other

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,610
uses for it as well that that was one of

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,010
the first use cases for it moving

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,700
forward the next part of my journey was

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,740
in a marketing analytics company and you

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,740
can see the number of logos increases

00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:03,040
over time here because the things that

00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:07,300
you could do and the pace of the market

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:11,320
developing continues to evolve so this

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:13,780
is where we start to get into using many

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,680
of the new machine learning libraries

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,820
doing optimization and forecasts

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,160
probably a lot of familiar logos to

00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,660
people in the room here and then a data

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,170
science really what we're trying to do

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:30,040
is to bring together that ecosystem of

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:32,080
tools and infrastructure and deliver a

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,420
platform to the companies that we work

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,310
with that take some of the pain and

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,840
friction out of connecting all of those

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,000
pieces together so what we've seen is

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,940
there's a gap in the market today

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,300
I think everyone sees the opportunity

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,910
and applying data science and using data

00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:56,280
science to drive their business forward

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:58,740
to grow their business but very few are

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,730
measuring and quantifying and

00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:04,150
understanding the business value of

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,130
applying data science and this gap is

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,510
something that should concern everyone

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,190
in the room because if people aren't

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,720
seeing value out of it if they're not

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,550
understanding it if they don't know how

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,920
to measure it there's going to be

00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:19,630
challenges and continuing to move the

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:22,479
market forward so we we see this picture

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,440
as being a very common framework that

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,020
data science

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,000
are working in they have many

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,220
stakeholders pulling them into different

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,650
directions they need to work with all of

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,330
these stakeholders to make sure they're

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,830
all on the same page in terms of the

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,680
goals of the model that's being

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,630
developed they want to understand the

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,670
data they want to understand the history

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,980
of the data and why the data is set up

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,250
in the way that it is and as they work

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,200
through different steps in analysis from

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,320
connecting two data sets to building

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,290
models to deploying models to measuring

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,330
the results of those models there's

00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,430
roadblocks and want along the way so

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,680
getting access to the data is usually

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,660
one of the first roadblocks you know how

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,460
do you work with that IT team to make

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:13,150
sure that you can access the right data

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:15,070
understanding the form and the the

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:19,420
history of the data is really important

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,310
too many times a Data Platform or a data

00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,070
infrastructure will be set up without

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,020
any input of the data science team so

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,600
what you end up with is a lot of rework

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,890
a lot of manual intervention to get the

00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,590
data in a place where it's actually

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:37,720
usable by the data science team so let's

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,669
let's move forward here to what are the

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,650
things that are driving this broad

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,320
adoption of Jupiter

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,060
I think the poster session the first

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,330
night was really interesting because you

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,040
got to see all of these different teams

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,260
that are working on really interesting

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,340
challenges and applying Jupiter to solve

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,530
those challenges what we've seen is that

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,450
there is a common link now every

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,000
industry is focused on data science

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,950
everyone's building out a team and the

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,620
role of a data scientists and a data

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,200
science team has really changed and this

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,240
is a fairly recent change where you know

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,370
they may have been an R&D function they

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,780
may have been doing back-office work

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,919
they may have been doing more of a

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:23,830
research focused outputs but now what

00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:27,070
they do is directly impacting the entire

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:30,490
business so teams and HR teams and

00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:33,160
finance teams and marketing are directly

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,680
using and directly applying the outputs

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,740
of the data science team and there's no

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,990
longer this distinction in between

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,259
you know this is a data science project

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,939
where we'll get a piece of analysis the

00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,490
output of the data science team is now

00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,589
driving every interaction that that

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:53,580
business has was their consumers and

00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:55,110
partners that they work with the second

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,270
one I think you know there's a reason

00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,189
here why I was talking to Fernando that

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,360
more people showed up than they expected

00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:05,339
at this conference and the conference

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:09,629
exists now so Jupiter is growing it's

00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:12,330
growing faster we we built a tool to do

00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,339
some analysis on the open source repos

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,550
and some of the activity around those

00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,050
and use it internally and it's actually

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,119
available if anyone wants to check it

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,509
out it's on our website data science

00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:27,089
comm trends and you know this is just a

00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:29,069
little snapshot of that to say okay well

00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:30,740
how are people using Jupiter and how is

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:34,830
the growth of Jupiter and you could see

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:39,149
this rapid steady continuing growth of

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:41,759
Jupiter you shift over to understanding

00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:46,379
the ecosystem of packages around Jupiter

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,029
as well and the trend is very clear you

00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,620
know even in the last year we're seeing

00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:52,499
tremendous growth so it's exciting to

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,269
see the community's growth the

00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:56,490
community's involvement and the

00:07:54,269 --> 00:08:01,080
continued innovation around the Jupiter

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:03,389
ecosystem it's becoming the tool of

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,909
choice we're seeing this that the

00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:09,089
customers that we work with they're

00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:12,059
they're requiring Python they need

00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:15,599
Python to be a core use case for their

00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:18,740
team they're using Jupiter extensively

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:23,129
they're using it in very innovative ways

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:28,259
and this shift to Python and open source

00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:30,419
and Jupiter we see it continuing so in

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,089
these last few years in rolling out our

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:36,539
platform and working with various teams

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:38,120
we definitely have seen some common

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,930
themes across these

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,930
high-performing teams so what are they

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:45,089
doing how are they actually applying

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:48,240
data science applying these tools in

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:50,820
ways that are delivering successfully on

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,590
the promise of data science and

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:58,440
driving impact at the business so this

00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:01,440
would be the first so the the the

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,330
disconnect between a data science team

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,700
and an engineering team shouldn't exist

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:09,750
they should be tied at the hip it should

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:12,690
be twins they should be aligned on the

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:16,890
the common set of tools the common set

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:19,260
of development best practices to ensure

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,880
that when you get to the end result of

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,620
what the data science team is produced

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,270
which is typically you know some type of

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,540
model that can be used within the

00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:30,030
organization that it doesn't require a

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,400
whole series of steps after that to

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:35,220
actually move through the pipeline of

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,020
production systems so if those teams are

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,840
coordinated if they're working hand in

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,810
hand if they have alignment on what

00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,190
tools to use the process around

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:48,210
development you know some people call it

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:50,190
DevOps for data science data ops is also

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,620
a term that has been thrown around but

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,470
this idea that engineering and data

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,240
science are becoming more intertwined

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:02,010
and need to be working more closely

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,570
together the second is you know it's

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,340
it's something nobody loves but you know

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,760
what what is our process how do we build

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:11,790
a model Factory how do we build a data

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,520
science workflow that everybody at the

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,160
company understands they can review the

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,560
steps in the process they have exposure

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,750
into where the team is in terms of the

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,490
development process they have the

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,980
ability to ask questions they have the

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,220
ability to review model development

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:32,250
provide input what this does is it it

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:36,570
helps move the process faster it creates

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:39,240
a clear opportunity for the team to give

00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,070
input and it also ensures as you move

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,900
through that cycle and you get to the

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,850
end result you're actually going to

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:49,200
deliver what your internal stakeholders

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:52,050
are looking for and finally I think the

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,730
the platform approach you know whether

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,110
you build one internally or use one of

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,020
the providers that are here at the

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,640
conference it's really it's it's gonna

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,670
help in the short term but also the long

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,440
term so you know if you grow from a team

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,550
of one or two data scientist

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:12,690
to hundreds or thousands not having a

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:14,130
consistent cohesive technology approach

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:18,270
to how you interact with all of these

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:20,790
systems leads to trouble down the road

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:24,120
you have some issues with you know

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:26,030
knowledge transfer so as teams change

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,830
and shift and move on from the company

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,090
how do you maintain that core IP that's

00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,550
been developed from the data science

00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,020
team if you think of all the systems

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,540
that are required to actually interact

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,600
with whether they be Hadoop data lakes

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,240
or other internal systems the

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,980
out-of-the-box tools the the kind of

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,110
standard set of tools that are out there

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,940
there are some challenges in accessing

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,420
those data sets and working with them in

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:54,150
a consistent way so where do they fit in

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,120
what are what are data science platforms

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,700
and how do they fit into this broad

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,700
ecosystem they they definitely don't

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,770
live on their own I think you know they

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,170
are one piece of this technology

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:10,020
landscape that we're seeing larger

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:12,780
enterprises start to adopt they need to

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,660
connect into all of the tools that data

00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,400
science teams prefer to use they need to

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,810
work with all the common libraries and

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,110
machine learning tools that people are

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:24,420
using today but importantly for

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,150
especially for the IT teams and the

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,060
teams that are thinking about security

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,920
and data governance they need to connect

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,660
to those systems too and they need to do

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,190
it in a consistent way in a repeatable

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,090
way in a way that's in line with the

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,240
technology and engineering teams

00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,640
requirements as well and in the end they

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,950
they aren't typically creating entire

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,370
new data ecosystems they should connect

00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:52,500
into the existing data ecosystem so most

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,030
teams have made big investments and big

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,450
bets in either using a cloud provider

00:12:54,030 --> 00:13:02,430
developing a data lake and this is a way

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:04,770
to get value out of those so with that

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,150
I'll wrap it up we are here if you

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,550
haven't stopped by we have a booth just

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,500
outside the door and we'd love to show

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,560
you what we do all right thank you

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,560
