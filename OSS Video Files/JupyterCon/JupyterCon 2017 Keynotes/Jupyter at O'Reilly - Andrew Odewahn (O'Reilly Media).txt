thanks so much you know it's Fernando

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,990
said I'm and Rhoda won I'm the CTO of

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,929
O'Reilly Media and we're really thrilled

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,630
to be participating in hosting Jupiter

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,240
Khan with a non focus foundation and the

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,130
project Jupiter and you know I want to

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,470
situate our participation here in kind

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,650
of the history of the company we've had

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,560
a long a long track record of spotting

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,029
innovations early O'Riley you know put

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,080
the first commercial website on the

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,050
Internet

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,420
we created the term web 2.0 came out of

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,940
Anna Reilly event we launched the maker

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,190
movement with the publication of make

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,250
magazine and even the term open source

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,430
came from an original and a riley event

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,739
so we've really helped identify

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,780
popularize and catalyze a lot of the

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,399
kinds of technology movements and i

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,289
think one of the things that's really on

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,239
our radar is Jupiter it's kind of one of

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,760
the next big things that's that's coming

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,219
up and you know I think it's probably as

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,590
you've listened to speakers like Tim

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,769
Baba yesterday and Lorena just now and

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,909
Jeremy earlier this morning and and

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,350
everybody in the sessions it's really

00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,850
Jupiter is a tool that's fundamental to

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,990
the mission of our company which is

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,030
helping to spread the knowledge of

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,920
innovators getting the information out

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,930
of people who know things and getting it

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,450
to a wide audience in a diverse way and

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,159
Jupiter's ability to weave complex

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,310
computational narratives that include

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,920
text and code and images and interactive

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,600
kinds of elements I'll really allow that

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,909
amazing transmission and that's why

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,950
we're so fascinated by it so we're

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,630
really looking to use this to help us

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,240
create kind of the next generation of

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,310
technical media and what I want to talk

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,840
about a little bit first is just kind of

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,549
our approach how we're thinking about

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,200
the how this process would actually work

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,670
and then you know wouldn't be doing my

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,799
job as a conference chair if I didn't

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,439
say you know we want to work with you to

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,380
help create this both as creators of the

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,060
the tools creators of the media and also

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,960
as people who are consuming it and using

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,630
it so first our approach it's basically

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,000
a fairly simple three-part model it

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,849
starts with your content to which we add

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,860
a docker file and then we have a runtime

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,490
for your Europe container so how you're

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,060
actually going to be able to run

00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:18,670
the the notebook itself for content

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,830
everything I think and our tool chain

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,330
typically begins with git so we began

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,700
with a repository that has your

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,110
notebooks your data your assets

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,310
basically everything you need for

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,680
whatever your kind of media you're

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,990
creating needs to begin its life in a

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,630
git repository this is a screenshot of

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,690
our internal get lab repository we've

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,760
got a server we've got about 6,000

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,590
different git projects that we use to

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,110
create pretty much all of our all of our

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,640
books and materials and not all of them

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,170
use Jupiter but you know it's it's a big

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,310
commitment to get so we've been using it

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,700
a long time it's a it's a very

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,650
successful tool this the second part of

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,020
the model is we add a docker file to one

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,370
of these repositories and if you're not

00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,020
familiar with docker it very quickly

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,940
it's a way to specify a computing

00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,800
environment so that you can say here's

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,140
all the dependencies that a computer

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,750
your you need for a process to run and

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,330
then you can ship packaged it up into a

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,790
container that can be shipped anywhere

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,560
we use the docker stacks project which

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,750
is another great project supported by

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,160
the Jupiter community which provides a

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,710
number of docker files that give you a

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,480
variety of computing scenarios so if

00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,650
you're doing scientific computing you

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,180
can just say I want to use the docker

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,710
file for scientific computing and it

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,650
comes with you know a million different

00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:33,160
pieces of software similarly there's one

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,670
for for data science for scala for AR

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,470
for tensorflow so really a host of

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,380
different kinds of things and it really

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,210
helps you get jump-started quickly then

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,650
the last part of the model is a runtime

00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,120
like how do you actually once you've got

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,580
a notebook and you've got a you know

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,170
specification of what your components

00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,390
are that it needs how do you actually

00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,610
run that notebook and to think about

00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,920
this you know I'm an MBA so I have to

00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,260
have everything in a two by two matrix

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,630
we've thought about breaking that up

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,400
into this sort of grid like if you're

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,840
running it on your own computer who your

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,280
runtime maybe it's just Conda you know

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,400
whatever Peter Wang talk about how what

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,490
an important tool that is so you might

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,960
use Conda you might use docker or a

00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,280
virtual box on your own machine so

00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,930
you're you're running it inside a

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,090
virtual virtualized on your own computer

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,140
or you might use Jupiter hub but if

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,810
you're deploying it to the cloud

00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,110
somewhere or binder he heard Jeremy I

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,360
think it's great news that

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,550
that Jupiter the Jupiter project is

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,050
gonna be supporting behind her or you

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,979
might just simply run it purely on the

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:36,319
cloud on something like adjure or Google

00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:38,979
Google clouds but however you do it you

00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,090
need to be able to give a users a

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,289
running instance of the notebook and

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,650
that's a kind of a big problem that

00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:47,569
we're working on helping to solve so

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,800
that's kind of how we think about it you

00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,210
know that's our approach you know but

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,830
what's kind of what's in it for you if

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,629
you if you work with us you know what

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,569
are the options that you have as people

00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:58,610
who are who are creating this stuff the

00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:00,680
first is obviously books you know we've

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,569
been a long time out

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,240
right long being relative in the life of

00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:08,180
software a supporter of using notebooks

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,069
for creating books and just traditional

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,110
kinds of media probably the most popular

00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:13,789
has been on the Python data science

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,199
Handbook which I've seen which is by

00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:17,990
Jake Bainter plas and so it's a

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,610
wonderful reference but what's what's

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,080
really cool about it is because we've

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,509
got such a commitment to get and we've

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,069
used it we've also been able to cross

00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:28,339
license it so that he can put it up on

00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:31,900
github and it's been parentally one of

00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:34,460
the top trending Jupiter projects on on

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,050
github and I just kind of randomly

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,279
picked this day you know I didn't I

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,199
didn't do anything else but you know

00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,569
it's the number one trending repo just

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,779
on the Rando day that I picked a pic to

00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:46,310
do this screenshot the second way that

00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:48,349
you could work with us oh well I should

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,219
let me just go back for a second you

00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,110
know I know a lot of people are

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:52,669
concerned about their content being

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,139
locked away inside some kind of

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,240
proprietary system or some kind of

00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,349
proprietary publisher I think this is

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,389
one of the things that really helps

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:02,240
insulate against that we have a great

00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,620
history of light for electable licensing

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,110
models so we're trying to address that

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,919
and make really support the open nature

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:12,229
of content the second way that we've got

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,879
for exploring and using Jupiter

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:17,089
technologies the format we call orioles

00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,729
and those are basically ways that your

00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:22,009
content starts its life as a notebook

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,900
but then we take it and we marry it to a

00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,699
video of you in the studio and you're

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,560
able to talk through the notebook and

00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,419
provide additional context so that you

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,860
can kind of give color commentary as

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,750
you're going a lot of people like to

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,020
have multiple modalities of learning and

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,940
oriole is a technology for doing that

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,180
but what I'm really excited to

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,250
and a new program and a new way to work

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,980
with us is through our online training

00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,260
program in the Safari platform so we

00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,420
launched earlier this year an ability to

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,550
have instructor-led training in Safari

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,110
and it's been a huge success and

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,270
basically you're able to go to one of

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,530
these courses interact directly with the

00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,970
instructor because it's you have a

00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,380
person there on the other end that you

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,960
can ask questions of and that you can

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,550
get more more feedback than you would

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,500
normally get through just a webcast or

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,770
something that's static and it's been a

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,650
hugely successful program and you know

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,870
what we're doing is pairing that that

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,310
great program with a Jupiter hub so if

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,770
you're want to teach a course if you

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,380
want to teach a class we'll take your

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,330
git repository of your notebooks will

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,620
help you work to build a docker file for

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,780
it if you if you don't have one already

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,190
and we'll spin up a Jupiter hub instance

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,660
and then you'll be able to give that to

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,640
people as you're doing your class and

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,190
your training so it's just a great way

00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,160
to give a great experience for the

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,510
course and you know I think I can't

00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,210
remember who mentioned the work that

00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,710
Chris holds graph and all the other

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,330
Carroll willing and men and all you know

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,620
all these up people in the project have

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,720
been doing a great job making this

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,880
process of setting the Jupiter hub

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,180
instances up really easily and we're

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,350
leveraging that so what it looks like is

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,410
basically when you're the instructor

00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,760
you'll get a link right before your

00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,860
class and did you can send to your

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,030
students so you've posted in slack they

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,490
click on the link and then immediately

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,130
they're into the content and they're

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,720
into having a great experience you know

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,100
and the problems it kind of solves is

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,570
you know I don't know how many of you

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,720
have been to trainings where the first

00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,710
20 or 30 minutes looks about like this

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,000
because you've got the wrong version of

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,110
PIP you've got the wrong version of

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,750
Python maybe you've got the wrong

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,370
version of some other software or maybe

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,840
you don't have enough Wi-Fi you know

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,460
there's just a whole host of things that

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,980
go wrong and what we're trying to do is

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,080
reduce the friction so that you can just

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,960
get immediately into learning and focus

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,240
on both you as the teacher you know as

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,310
the instructor and also the students can

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,930
have a great immediate experience and

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,969
reduce the pain of trying to get all

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,200
this stuff to work and to set up and

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,560
that's one of the great things that

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,350
Jupiter can do for you so we're

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,030
launching with six instructors Paco is

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,380
one of the people who had Paco Nathan

00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,059
has one of the people who volunteered he

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,379
he

00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:56,119
described himself as a guinea pig so I'm

00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:57,769
just gonna describe myself describe him

00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:00,019
as a guinea pig - these are those guinea

00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:01,730
pigs and we're trying to really show the

00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:05,089
full breadth of things that you can do

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,379
with the Jupiter platform when we're

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:07,910
doing training so we have everything

00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,040
from natural language processing just

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,480
statistics to practice the data cleaning

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,449
and Python to tensorflow

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,850
to go and we're using the Jupiter's the

00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:18,859
Gopher notes kernel to support go

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:22,609
training so we really want to have a

00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:23,899
wide variety of things and let's so

00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:25,160
later today if you're interested in

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,929

an email that's going to describe to you

00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:31,369
how you can pre enroll for the for

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,709

quickly so you'll have you'll be able to

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,600
get kind of priority registration and

00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:43,489
then you know we want to work with

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,069
engage with you so if you are interested

Jupiter or really just working with us

00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:52,100
