	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,710
so at IBM we have really embraced at

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,200
Jupiter and the Jupiter stack and we

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,599
have used that in various of our

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,089
products like Watson studio and Watson

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:19,050
machine learning in others as well that

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,789
are based on notebooks so what is Watson

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,710
studio and what it brings to you the

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,539
Watson studio accelerates the machine

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,810
learning and deep learning workflows

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,980
required to infuse AI into the

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,610
enterprise and drive innovation but if

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,800
we really look into what is in Watson

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,559
you still doing it's basically build on

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,440
top of open source particularly Jupiter

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,500
notebooks we then on top of that we

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,440
start providing collaboration

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,289
capabilities ability to run on different

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,989
environments and also I start

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,350
associating that into like for example

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:02,850
spark runtimes where you can start to

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:07,560
accelerate the big data analytics that

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:11,090
uses a spark code for building in

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,090
analyzing the data that you might have

00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:21,270
when we started implementing that or the

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,009
users starting to adding to their

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,740
environment on the enterprise

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,049
particularly on on-premise deployments

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,420
we started seeing some limitations and

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:34,170
that was motivated us to start building

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,820
Jupiter enterprise gateway kind of fancy

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,340
definition of Duplin enterprise gateway

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,530
is that is a lightweight multi-tenant

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,990
scalable secured gateway that enables

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,500
notebooks to start sharing resources

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,659
across a cluster for us that we are more

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,119
familiar with notebooks in Jupiter what

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,130
it really means is that we enable remote

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,500
kernels and those kernels gets

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,979
distributed and available on the

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,560
runtimes that you have when we started

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,049
building enterprise gateway we focus on

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,290
three main things we want to make sure

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:10,140
we had optimized resource allocation

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,580
which means that we will not be using

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,590
only the resources on the current

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,890
machine we'll start using the resources

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,150
on

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,590
all the cluster so that we can scale the

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,610
number of data scientists that we can

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,200
connect to a given run time we also one

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,459
of the first customers that we had was

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,560
the IBM cloud and the security policy

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,750
that we have there is very strict so we

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,910
wanted to make sure that we had enhanced

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,890
security and then and all the

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,650
communications end-to-end were properly

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,930
secured so we enable the the socket

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,330
socket communication particularly now

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,750
that it's remote to be encrypted and all

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,870
the other communications as well and we

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,130
also wanted to bring the notion of like

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,100
multi-user support with user

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,130
impersonation we leverage Kerberos in

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,890
some of the environments or we do other

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,810
techniques to implement that on the

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,600
right side of the slide you can see a

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,550
lot of like resources links that you can

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,239
use to learn more about enterprise

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:16,260
catering and some of the supported

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:21,209
platforms including like spark spark and

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:24,299
kubernetes and in others also recently

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,989
we have been saying that deep learning

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:31,079
is kind of like very hot very a lot of

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:35,610
people using that we have also seen the

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:37,739
rise of deep learning as a service kind

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:42,209
of like a platforms those platforms tend

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,970
to abstract a lot of like the underneath

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,200
the different platforms and how they the

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,870
different frameworks and how they

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:55,290
actually enables you to train and deploy

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,650
your model unfortunately those platforms

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,459
are kind of like in a batch mode

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,709
particularly because this deep learning

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:07,739
workloads tend to take a lot of time and

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:10,109
batch is not really good and not what we

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,760
as the data scientists are familiar when

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:14,519
we are using notebooks and performing

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,590
kind of like interactive development so

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,200
one of the things that we are working on

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,380
is basically trying to integrate those

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,710
platforms and make it very easy to use

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,830
from the notebooks if you want to learn

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,580
more I have a session a little bit

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:33,080
today and also we're gonna have a min up

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,400
tonight where we're gonna go into much

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,030
more details of what we are doing in

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,099
this area and last but not least I have

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,860
some announcements to do so like today

00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:45,919
enterprise gateway is just coming the

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,729
one all release out so go give it a try

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,699
take a look see how it can help you guys

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:54,919
and also not completely done yet but we

00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,180
have started a process to make so

00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,449
currently we are a just an incubator

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:03,259
project we have started the process to

00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:05,780
graduation and we should be announcing

00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:08,889
that part as well very soon in the next

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,389
maybe a few days or a week or so so

00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:14,330
that's mostly what I wanted to bring to

00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,129
you guys find me on the boobs or or on

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,620
my sessions for further questions that

00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:23,079
you might have thank you very much

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,079
[Applause]

00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,040
