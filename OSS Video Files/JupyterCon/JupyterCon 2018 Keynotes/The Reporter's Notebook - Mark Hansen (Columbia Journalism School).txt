Title: The Reporter's Notebook - Mark Hansen (Columbia Journalism School)
Publication date: 2020-08-26
Playlist: JupyterCon 2018 Keynotes
Description: 
	Beyond Twitter, Facebook, and similar networks, without question, data, code, and algorithms are forming systems of power in our society. Mark Hansen explains why it is crucial that journalists—explainers of last resort—be able to interrogate these systems, holding power to account.

Hansen would like to thank Gabriel Dance, Nick Confessore, and Rich Harris from the New York Times. He would also like to thank Mike Young and Suman Deb Roy and the students in his computational classes.

I'd like to thank the organizers for

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,850
inviting me to be part of this event

00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,160
it's a pleasure and an honor to be able

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,559
to share my experiences with you this

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,540
morning while preparing for this talk I

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,280
read a beautiful piece in the Columbia

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,990
Journalism Review by Philip Eyal a

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,840
freelancer from Providence Rhode Island

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,910
his article was entitled an ode to

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,619
reporters notebooks we've all seen

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,449
portrayals of journalists on television

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,390
shows and movies notebooks and hands

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,449
scribbling furiously for I'll however

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,840
and a reporter's notebook is more than

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,790
paper and cardboard it symbolizes the

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,670
power and uniqueness of journalism as a

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,559
profession in his words this object is a

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,680
license to talk to interesting people

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,420
and a ticket to interesting places the

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,730
key to bringing these people and places

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,530
to life Eyal writes is to capture and

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,219
convey the details of a reporter's

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,500
notebook

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,090
no the capture the details and the

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,280
reporters notebook is how he captures

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,559
the sights smells sounds feelings tastes

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,840
and other impressions of the world to

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,420
report is to be alert and alive in a

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,749
particular time in place I think that's

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,539
worth I think that's worth repeating to

00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:12,359
report is to be alert and alive in a

00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:14,670
particular time in place now my training

00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,319
is not in journalism but statistics when

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,029
I arrived at the journalism school I was

00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,130
told over and over the journalism is

00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:22,289
less an academic discipline than it is a

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,299
habit of mind we cultivate in our

00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:27,119
students a curiosity about the world

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,520
a restless questioning spirit that asks

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,289
why things look the way they do and my

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,749
role as a statistician in a journalism

00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:36,329
school is to add computational lines of

00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:38,009
inquiry to this habits of mind if you

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,859
take one thing from my talk to this

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,020
morning it's that just as reporter a

00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,299
reporter's notebook represents a call to

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,639
be alert and alive in a particular time

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,709
in place understanding the computing

00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:52,319
systems we rely on daily opens our eyes

00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,939
to new aspects of the world to see and

00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,649
interrogate the algorithms that

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,409
increasingly govern how our society

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,329
functions and just as the reporters

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,209
notebook symbolizes that call to be

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,039
alert and alive for me in my teaching

00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,469
the Jupiter note book extends that

00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,619
alertness and curiosity to the virtual

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,690
world of data code and algorithm

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:15,360
in some sense my mission at the j-school

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,220
is not new Joseph Pulitzer himself the

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,440
founder of our school at Columbia wrote

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,290
in the North American review in 1904

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,550
about his college of journalism and

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,740
recommended what should be taught to

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,840
promote the welfare of the public in

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,850
this essay in addition to law ethics and

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,210
history which we still teach today he

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,190
includes statistics data

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,800
he writes everybody says that statistics

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,200
should be taught but how statistics is

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,570
not simply figures it said that nothing

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,670
lies like figures except the facts if

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,620
you want statistics to tell you the

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,540
truth you can find the truth there if

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,700
you know how to get at it and romance

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,070
human interests humor and fascinating

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,610
revelations as well I think of that for

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,480
a second

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,950
romance human interests humor from data

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,120
Pulitzer saw tremendous narrative power

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,190
in data today at Columbia about half of

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,890
our graduating class take some kind of

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,810
data elective we offer a separate MS in

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,670
data journalism and even dual degree

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,489
with computer science and we're not

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,170
alone last year we offered a report on

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,690
the state of computation in journalism

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,010
education in the United States for those

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,959
of you are interested there are also

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,519
annual meetings of computational and

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,220
data journalists you could attend like

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,500
my car and news Geist you'll find Python

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,350
tutorials and introductions to our and

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,940
yes plenty of Jupiter all of this is in

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,950
response to the simple fact that data

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,110
code and algorithms all manner of

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,269
computing technologies wield real power

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,519
in our society and journalists need to

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,250
be able to see and then interrogate that

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,340
power again we want our students to be

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,850
alert and alive in a particular time in

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,860
place but now fully aware of the virtual

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,650
as well as physical systems shaping the

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,560
world around them each spring I teach a

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,320
course in computational journalism at

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,390
the j-school given the techno political

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,640
dimensions of the 2016 election last

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,350
year we introduced a theme to anchor the

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,720
course we called it computational

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,410
propaganda here is a list of most of the

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:17,400
topics we covered before going too far I

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,380
should reiterate my use of the platform

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,810
of choice is in the j-school is the

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,010
jupiter notebook I use it for both R as

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,740
well as Python

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,080
and how here's a few of our notebooks

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:33,270
some basics on Python maybe how the web

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,070
works how machines learn how influence

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,380
around hashtags has become a new kind of

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,940
political argument after all who was

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,710
responsible for the shutdown of the

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,650
government last spring was it Trump or

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:48,780
Schumer let's see which hashtag trended

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:53,360
and find out we build BOTS some on the

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,360
Alexa platform and then some on Twitter

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,750
and I'm going to take BOTS as a kind of

00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,580
case study to represent what we did in

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,640
the class and how computation fit into

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,830
journalism for the rest of this talk

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,870
because BOTS have been particularly

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,760
influential in all manners of political

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,740
processes from voting to participation

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,700
in the census and fill out your census

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,050
forms as you know BOTS serve various

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,930
different purposes

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,510
there are BOTS that notify here's one

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,890
that alerts you when a new when a word

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,900
appears for the first time on the front

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,400
page of The New York Times and another

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,480
that live tweets earthquakes from the

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,270
San Francisco Bay Area

00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,850
then there are BOTS that inform every

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,800
track is a busy is busy tweeting out a

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,170
satellite image of every census tract in

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,930
the United States and finally there are

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:44,070
BOTS that amplify what do I mean by that

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:47,580
well this is John Lagoo Simoes Twitter

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:51,000
page and here is one of his tweets I'm

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,120
good you somehow this statement earned

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,040
him 34 likes and four retweets who are

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,720
the people who find this worthwhile to

00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:03,420
amplify well CPLR Cohen for one a

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,970
faceless account that has liked 46,000

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,070
other tweets in eight years or kim hill

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,690
and you have to wonder how she had time

00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,300
to pose for this image given that she's

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,340
liked 86,000 tweets in two years about

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,150
10 tweets an hour for 12 hours a day

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,880
every day of the year and then you have

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,290
marquis martinez his account looks more

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,150
respectable until you read that he's

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,530
from america the city in georgia and

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,890
claims to be the Dean of the Harvard

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,680
Medical School but he does caution that

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,240
his tweets are his own one of the first

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,120
issues we tackled in class then with

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,780
bots was how we could be sure if an

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,600
account was in

00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,520
fact a person or a bot it's a dark art

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,960
but offered us the opportunity to teach

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,120
the students something about machine

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,669
learning there are services that can

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,370
help but they're noisy marki is clearly

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:55,260
a bot but then again you can simply do a

00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,970
google image search on his profile

00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,220
picture and find that this poor man is

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:02,340
associated with names like Gabriel Sam

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,100
and Arthur on different platforms as

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,190
another example in looking at the fake

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,540
news surrounding the parkland shooting

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,669
this year we found that one of the most

00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,010
active accounts in promoting the sort of

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:16,140
fake news hashtag crisis actors was an

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,080
account toe Ches eighty-six thousand

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:22,700
tweets in two years human well BOTS or

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,350
not says yes so it's a messy business

00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,210
but given all this our next step was to

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,880
see what kind of influence we as a class

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,250
could have what what were what kinds of

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,110
messages could we amplify so we opened a

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:38,580
Twitter account called it Rosie Turing

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:40,919
mm-hmm a Google search then turned up a

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,800
doorway to our popularity we could

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,930
simply buy followers we selected a

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,180
company Diwani that seemed highly rated

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,690
which only later we realized was because

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,570
the company's CEO was an SEO expert it

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,320
promised amazing growth and the process

00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,450
was simple

00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,300
essentially you pay them and the

00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,729
followers would come flocking and so we

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,640
did and so they did we bought about

00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:07,860
twenty five hundred in total I expected

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,840
accounts like CP alarcón Kim Hill or

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,669
Marquis Martinez and instead we had

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,039
accounts like these they looked great

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:16,320
their bio pics matched the background

00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,940
images Facebook and Instagram links

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,880
pointed to accounts featuring the same

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,440
people these were real I thought but the

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,090
economics didn't work out we paid a

00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,800
couple of pennies for each followers so

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,870
I would as someone do anything for a

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,320
couple pennies it just didn't make sense

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,510
but then we noticed a tell a clever bot

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,099
maker had simply lifted people's data

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,530
and created a new account with a

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:41,039
slightly altered name lowercase Elle's

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,650
became eyes and vice-versa zeros for o's

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:47,370
and underscores became doubled the

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:49,620
strategy worked so well because the

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,279
actual login name appears only in small

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,139
gray letter

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,930
on the Twitter interface or maybe up in

00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,959
the URL the bot maker was indiscriminate

00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:00,420
young old singles couples adults miners

00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:03,329
all transformed into BOTS that went on

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,790
to tweet or retweet statuses from do

00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:08,579
Bumi's various clients in multiple

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:12,860
languages often political often heavily

00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:15,809
pornographic I'm gonna skip over these

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:24,240
right I'm not skipping over anything

00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:25,589
oops so from our 2500 followers that we

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,319
purchased we crawled up and down the

00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:30,240
network to find out who else these

00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,309
accounts were following their so-called

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,129
friends and presumably their clients

00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:36,629
hilary rosen a commentator for CNN for

00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:38,160
example shared twenty four hundred of

00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:41,069
our twenty five hundred followers which

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,379
seemed suspicious and then we went back

00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:44,670
down the network from our followers and

00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:46,769
friends to find their followers and

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,769
friends hoping to find more bots we

00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,720
spidered the networking came up with

00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:55,110
50,000 or so stolen identities sometimes

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,899
stolen multiple times in all our work

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,329
was done on a jupiter notebook after

00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,740
this we decided we had a story so over

00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:04,319
martinis one evening at night car

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,689
another reason to go to night car we

00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:09,269
brought it up to the times and made a

00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,829
pitch so my students gave a pitch and a

00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:15,230
year later and a lot of computation

00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:18,180
under the under the bridge disappeared

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,850
buying online influence from a shadowy

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,470
market i don't know how many of you have

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,819
been on page a1 above the fold on a

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,009
sunday but let me tell you that's kind

00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:28,009
of exciting and then online

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,180
on line there's a beautiful interactive

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,940
that I would direct you to so here's

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,790
some examples of people that we found

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:43,040
this is chef Simon he's an Iron Chef and

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,720
a co-host of ABC's the chew

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,270
he bought hundreds of thousands of

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,980
followers from davu me and you can see

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,830
hints of this by looking at at his

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,140
followers these are easily obtained from

00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,810
the Twitter API each blue dot on this

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,180
graph is a follower on the x-axis is the

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,970
order they followed the chef and the

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,940
y-axis is the year they joined Twitter

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:07,850
this graph goes to about 2013 his first

00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,410
few years on Twitter and everything kind

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,480
of looked okay this is what organic

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,330
growth looks like when you start to have

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,460
followers follow you on twitter there's

00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,200
a slow hill because as time goes by

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,810
people who are joining Twitter later

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,180
find your you find your account and

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,800
follow you but if you look at his

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,170
followers going up until last summer

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,180
this is what you see the stripes

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,040
indicate accounts that followed the chef

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,990
all about the same time and also join

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,120
Twitter at about the same time this is a

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,980
clear indication of bod accounts as bot

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,620
makers will often make their accounts in

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,940
bulk and perhaps a perhaps because they

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,370
acquired a list of stolen email

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,420
addresses at one time here's a similar

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,070
pattern and this is where it gets

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,580
unfortunate for Hillary Rosen's

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,630
followers here's Martha Lane Fox for

00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,450
those of you don't know her she's a

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,280
Twitter board member that one hurt and

00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,960
you can look at and you can look at the

00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,080
article for others there are sports

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,990
figures there are entertainers and so on

00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,360
all trying to amplify their message

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,460
through purchasing followers the story

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,260
behind the company Davo me is itself

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,680
fascinating they claim to be on Varick

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,880
Street but we're in some I put my

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,530
students thought we could just interview

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,150
them but instead they were in Palm Beach

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,760
and now they simply aren't taking

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,680
clients at all it turns out they don't

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,570
really make any of these BOTS themselves

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,340
it's an arbitrage scheme with davu me

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,310
buying followers on behalf of clients

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,510
from a third party manufacturers

00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,700
advertising mainly on blackhat world

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:34,100
that means most of their business is

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,500
accounting and through services like

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,660
pker you can buy and sell any manner of

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,730
fake engagements everything from

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,740
LinkedIn followers to well you name it

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,830
the fallout from our article was pretty

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,480
intense

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,040
actually I'll start here hacker news

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,120
said essentially if a bunch of

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,310
journalists could do this why can't

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,050
Twitter's engineers which I took is

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,390
slightly insulting as the whole purpose

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:59,430
of the class was to prepare journalists

00:12:54,390 --> 00:13:01,110
to do this anyway but a couple people

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,730
are embarrassed some through their aides

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,900
under the bus some claim that they

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,610
believe that the followers they bought

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,770
were real which didn't seem to be an

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,290
excuse for me but anyway attorneys

00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:12,450
general in different states open cases

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,000
in the Senate directed the FCC to look

00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:17,250
at impersonation and lots of BOTS died

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,650
seemingly overnight and then ultimately

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,930
last month Twitter went farther and

00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,760
purged tens of thousands of account of

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:27,840
tens of millions of accounts citing our

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,790
story as a rationale and this is why it

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,020
might slide about 10 slides back had to

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,760
borrow some graphics from the digital

00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,350
forensics lab because the purge happened

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,880
and we hadn't had a chance to screen cap

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,730
anything I can't believe we didn't do

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,860
that again if you remember one thing

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,750
from this talk it's that just as the

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,970
reporters notebook represents a call to

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,640
be alert and alive in a particular time

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,890
in place computation teaching

00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,930
journalists to program extends that

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:54,330
alertness and curiosity to the virtual

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,340
world of data code and algorithms they

00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,780
are now able to interrogate the systems

00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,180
that bring us information every day

00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:03,210
systems that are often driven by opaque

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,610
algorithms Philip Eyal finishes his ode

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,800
to a reporter's notebook commenting that

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,110
perhaps the most perhaps most

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,910
importantly the reporters notebook is

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:15,150
one of the world's greatest mechanisms

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,040
for accountability by extension Jupiter

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,810
and the coding tools around it can be an

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,970
incredible entry point for an aspiring

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:23,220
journalist hoping to extend her reach

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,560
and question the often invisible but

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,410
undeniably powerful computing

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,240
technologies that shape our daily lives

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,290
thank you
