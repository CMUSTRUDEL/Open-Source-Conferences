Title: Democratizing Data - Tracy Teal (The Carpentries)
Publication date: 2020-08-26
Playlist: JupyterCon 2018 Keynotes
Description: 
	We are generating vast amounts of data, but it’s not the data itself that is valuable—it’s the information and knowledge that can come from this data. However, we’re limited in translating this sea of data into discovery and solutions, because we lack a diverse set of people with the skills, perspective, and access to work effectively with data.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
this conference has been really terrific

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,810
and it's clear that these are really

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:10,380
exciting times and it used to be right

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,570
that data was a commodity if you spent

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,299
the money to generate data or you had

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,600
access to data that was what gave you

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,640
the edge in that space but now we know

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,189
that things are changing around there

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,769
and there are three major forces that

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,750
have changed how we think about data and

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,109
how we can use it to address questions

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,260
in science and society the first is the

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,719
cost of the data so generating data is

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,980
no longer the bottleneck we can generate

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:45,329
genomes and Twitter data and digitized

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,640
text so the ability to generate data is

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,579
no longer as costly as it used to be

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,920
the second is societal so there's a

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,219
growing appreciation and enthusiasm for

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,260
using data to answer questions to make

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,730
decisions and work in data driven

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,400
discovery and finally the third is the

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,380
technology and we've seen here the work

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,350
that is going into and continues to go

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,540
into making tools that allow us to work

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,600
with big data whether your definition of

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,689
big data is 50,000 rows in a spreadsheet

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,740
where you used to have 100 or generating

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:25,590
a terabyte of data in five seconds

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,570
so we now have the data and tools to

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:33,060
advance progress and address questions

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:36,479
in science and society but what data and

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,240
tools alone don't turn data information

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,780
and information into knowledge it's

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,030
people that do that work and so if we

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,880
can empower more people with the skills

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,799
to work with data and computing we'll be

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,070
able to answer more questions more

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,439
diverse questions so we talked about

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,380
bringing compute to data or data to

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,909
compute but what we need to be doing is

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,740
bringing people to data so the question

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,229
then becomes along with all these

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,560
incredible advances and generating data

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,410
and developing tools how do we scale the

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,160
number of people who can work with data

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,830
along with data production so we've

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,870
talked about the tools what I'm going to

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,500
focus on in this talk is around the

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,600
training and the community elements of

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,850
working with data in advancing science

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:35,270
and society through questions that we

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:37,950
can use data to address so training so

00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,990
sometimes this is an exciting term we

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,700
heard this a great jupiter education

00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,930
track here and it's really awesome to

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,690
see all the people that are excited

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,120
about this and invested in it and that

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,340
is really true because there is such a

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,200
demand for training right now so

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,240
sometimes there's this perspective oh we

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,550
should train everybody should learn it

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,740
how's that should in it but that's not

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,050
the case right now so this is a survey

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,510
of bioinformatics resource Australia and

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,820
they asked what is the most useful thing

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,730
that bioinformatics resource Australia

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,460
can do and more than 50 percent of

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,290
respondents said offer training and this

00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,030
is one of the few surveys I've seen

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:20,070
where people want things more than

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:22,950
funding so there's a real demand and for

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,450
this training this is similarly in the

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,970
United States and this is still in the

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:31,320
research biology space there was a

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,390
survey of NSF pis and asked what are

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,250
their current unmet needs and you can

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,160
see that the top three things on this

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,720
list are training so we aren't in a

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,850
situation where we're trying to force

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,520
training on people people are looking

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,020
for these opportunities but the

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,090
challenge is is that we have a lot of

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,520
people who want to do this work who are

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,239
actively working who are students who

00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,130
haven't had access to this training so

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,350
using traditional courses is a great

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,450
approach but we also need to do

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,030
something like training in the gaps how

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:07,140
can we reach more people people with

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,870
active careers so training in the gaps

00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,570
it needs to be accessible and aligned

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,660
and by accessible I mean it means to be

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,160
available to all people

00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:20,190
accessibility meeting sort of standard

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,190
accessibility requirements and that

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,270
accessibility has several forums one is

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,270
the time that

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,340
it is where the resources are located is

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,729
it open elements like that

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,560
and second aligned we need to provide

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:36,840
training that is aligned with people's

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,610
interests a lot of times a traditional

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,319
CS course isn't something that's going

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,199
to align with someone's current needs

00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,169
how can we understand where people are

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,120
meet people where they are now teach

00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:50,250
them in domains that are relevant to

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,659
them and interesting to them so this

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,560
training needs to do both of these

00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:59,039
things so some opportunities for

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,099
training in the gaps workshops short

00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,880
courses kind of a week-long thing

00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:06,360
self-guided learning learning that's

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,039
online or learn Jupiter in 21 days I'm

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,139
waiting for Fernando to write that book

00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:16,349
next so MOOCs a lot of online MOOCs I'm

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,419
an integration into existing courses so

00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:21,419
wrapping it into things that already are

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:24,539
ongoing and so I'm going to talk today

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,710
about this training and one approach and

00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,860
I'm going to talk about the approach

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,780
that the carpentry is uses one because

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,120
that's the organization and I work with

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,060
and the other is that we have data from

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,889
all the work that we've been doing so

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,750
the kirpan trees is a recently merged

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,310
organization of software carpentry and

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,460
data carpentry if you've heard of either

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,610
of these and our goal is to train

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,900
researchers and the foundational skills

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,110
for working with data and code

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,599
effectively and reproducibly and we run

00:05:52,110 --> 00:06:00,539
two-day hands-on workshops teaching

00:05:54,599 --> 00:06:06,690
researchers things like r or python SQL

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:08,340
github command line open refine so we're

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,710
T trying to teach people these core

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,289
skills and we don't expect that we can

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,389
teach people everything in two days but

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:18,419
we make it an inclusive and engaging

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,490
learning environment and we teach create

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,500
that on-ramp to get people started and

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,569
build their confidence and using these

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,139
skills to go on and answer the questions

00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:29,849
that they have so let me talk a little

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,399
bit about how we do that in some of the

00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:34,649
outcomes so the first is that all of our

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,380
lessons are collaboratively developed

00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:38,130
openly licensed materials so we develop

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,560
all of our less

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,830
online on github almost all of our

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,800
lessons have more than 100 contributors

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:49,020
and they're all cc-by so anybody can use

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,600
them reuse them however they want and

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,850
lorina yesterday gave a great talk about

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,440
open educational resources and she

00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,420
talked about some of the missing things

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,700
and open educational resources that are

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,140
missing from Foss and I realized as she

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,690
was talking that that's actually exactly

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,270
what we do is is that we've combined the

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,180
idea of open educational resources with

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,300
the culture and the approaches and open

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,250
source so we have about 41 lessons so we

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,290
essentially have about 41 open source

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:21,180
projects that we manage the second thing

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,330
that is the key and that's our volunteer

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,700
instructors so we train people and how

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,320
to teach and this is really important

00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,660
because for a lot of the people who go

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,180
through vaunt instructor training which

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,740
a two-day workshop there as well this is

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,480
the first time they've ever been taught

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,420
how to teach these are often graduate

00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,460
students postdocs faculty and so

00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,740
learning how to teach affects how people

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,050
can deliver our workshops and though in

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,540
the way that helps increase confidence

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,060
and motivate people but people are also

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,340
take these skills around teaching and

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,900
use them in other teaching environments

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,370
or in interactions with their community

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,530
it helps people to be better

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,560
communicators our instructors are

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,480
amazing people that care about working

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,640
with people helping other people and

00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,980
we're trying to help them improve those

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:12,660
skills and be able to be effective in

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:15,960
their teaching so have this combination

00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,580
of instructors and materials you know

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,000
how do how does this scale so we

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,940
actually have over 1,300 instructors all

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,520
around the world and so having that many

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,100
instructors helps us scale our impact so

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,480
this is a trend of our workshop so you

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,460
can see we increased the number of

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,030
workshops and this year in 2018 we've

00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:38,190
already taught 450 workshops the number

00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:41,729
of learners that we've reached you can

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:44,760
see just over 7,000 last year so now

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,830
we're getting already into about 10,000

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,470
this year so we're able to scale the

00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,330
training and reach more communities not

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,760
only are we able to reach those numbers

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,310
but

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,990
able to have a broad geographic reach so

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,450
we have had workshops on all seven

00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,580
continents including Antarctica got

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,290
profiled in nature this week as evidence

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,490
that data science is occurring in

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:09,610
Antarctica that made me very happy and

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,530
so so we really are able to have a

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,720
global reach we have lesson translations

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,790
in Spanish instructor training in

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,080
Spanish and we're growing into other

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:22,150
languages and communities so that's one

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,370
element kind of these numbers here on

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:27,160
the left side of the grid but on the

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,830
right is this how does the workshop work

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,720
what's the impact sorry talked about one

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,030
of the really primary outcomes being

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,590
increased confidence right because if

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,360
you're not confident if you don't walk

00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,100
out of a class thinking this is

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,990
something that I can do what's going to

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,520
inspire you to keep learning what's

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,750
going to make you want to go use that in

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,150
your work

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,100
so 77 percent of people are more

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,040
comfortable with the tools after just a

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,990
two-day workshop when we look at long

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,940
term studies so six months or more after

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,090
a workshop these kinds of confidence

00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,920
numbers persist and additionally 54

00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,440
percent have made their analyses more

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,210
reproducible 65 percent feel they've

00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,100
continued to gain confidence in working

00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,570
with data and seventy-four percent have

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,700
recommended the carpet trees workshops

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,620
or friends or colleagues

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,510
so people value these workshops they

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,210
like them and they're using what they

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,460
learn in their work so you can see this

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,610
is just some things around confidence

00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,800
and writing programs that this is a pre

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,540
and post survey just right before and

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,670
after the workshop and things like

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,230
confidence and saying that they can

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,730
write a program to do their work have

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,860
increased a full point in just two days

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:40,540
so how does this help democratize data

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,850
skills so if we think about the Red

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,160
Cross what they did is they brought

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:49,060
first aid to all of us and so that now

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,190
we're able to respond as first responder

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,350
and save people with CPR do first aid

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,090
what we're doing through these training

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,190
programs is similar we're giving more

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,920
people these skills to use in their work

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:02,140
and so what that means is that people

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,830
can use these skills to answer more

00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:07,080
questions engage a more diverse set of

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,300
researchers and people in computational

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,670
analysis we can bring more creative

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,980
approaches and questions to our data and

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,890
there's really no losing everybody wins

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,350
so our Moneyball is not identifying

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:22,890
underappreciated talent or hiring that

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:27,300
Unicorn but creating programs that build

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:29,610
talent and all of this plays into a

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,230
community so what we're doing through

00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,730
training and giving more people these

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,680
skills is we're building a community of

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,900
practice around data one where people

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,660
feel empowered to do the work that they

00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,460
are excited about and hat and can

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,940
address important questions that they

00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,770
have our community of practice and when

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,800
we think that's important in learning

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:51,990
skills and impro gramming is that it's

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,150
inclusive and accessible that we have

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,160
opportunities to fail while learning

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,470
that that first pull request you put in

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,140
doesn't make you run away from coding

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,970
forever that you commit to lifelong

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,010
learning and that that is fostered as a

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,720
part of a community norm and that we

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,360
have local communities things like pi

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,520
ladies as well as virtual networks where

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,190
we can collect and connect and finally

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,730
that we can collaborate with open code

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:20,370
and open data so these are just some of

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,320
the terms that our community feels about

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,120
our community and you see there in the

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,050
center that the community aspect is

00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,480
really important so we think that and

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,660
this is a saying if you want to go fast

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,630
go alone but if we want to go far go

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,970
together and we've entered a new realm

00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:42,780
and we really have an opportunity to go

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:46,140
together further but this is a set of

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,490
you know researchers and innovators so I

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,260
really like to say if you want to go

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,300
fast go alone if you want to go in a lot

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,400
of different uncoordinated directions at

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,570
once go together

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,730
we're not implying we should all solve

00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,800
the same problem but that we can go

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,980
together to explore a lot of different

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,140
spaces so if we come back to this

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,720
triangle around how do we think about

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,120
democratizing data really at the center

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,130
of this triangle and the most important

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,790
thing that we can invest in are the

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:17,040
people giving them the skills to learn

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,390
but also valuing them once we have them

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,280
right valuing the

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,740
their work in a research environment and

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,920
a university environment at their jobs

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,080
valuing them as people and continuing to

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,930
support them rather than looking at

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:34,470
lines of code thinking about how we can

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:36,000
invest in the people so I'm really

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,760
fortunate to work with the carpentry

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,920

engagement and energy and enthusiasm

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,560
these people bring every day as well as

00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,700
