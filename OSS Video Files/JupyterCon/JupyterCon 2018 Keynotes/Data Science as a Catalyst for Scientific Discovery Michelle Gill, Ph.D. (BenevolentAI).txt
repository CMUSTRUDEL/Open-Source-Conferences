	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
so I am Michele Gill and I'm a senior

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,490
data scientist at benevolent AI a little

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,139
bit about our company we were founded in

00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,179
2013 with the mission of using

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,130
artificial intelligence for scientific

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,470
research and the benefit of society and

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,410
to that end we are focused on

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,150
pharmaceutical discovery so as Fernando

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,220
said I'm trained as a structural

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,220
biologist I did my PhD in molecular

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,869
biophysics and biochemistry for most of

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,820
my career I studied the motion of

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,929
enzymes enzymes are nature's and

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,140
machines and I think that they're pretty

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,090
rad I then transitioned into data

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,460
science including doing some deep

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,620
learning in chemistry which I also think

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,360
is pretty cool and so I'm now fortunate

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,640
enough to do both of those things at

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,750
once sometimes at the very same time in

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,969
my job so I don't have to tell you all

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,960
that artificial intelligence is all

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,010
around us be it email Auto responses

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,690
recommendation systems voice-activated

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,300
assistance or the promise of

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,730
self-driving cars and one of the key

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,010
reasons for this growth is access to

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,350
data it is an incredibly exciting time

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,810
to be in artificial intelligence field

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,040
because of this access to data and even

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,560
particularly within the scientific space

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,950
so I compiled all the sources in in the

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,930
pharmaceutical space of open datasets

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,790
open access journals and open source

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,369
code and I couldn't fit them all onto

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,820
this slide these are amazing amazing

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,650
times and of course let's not forget the

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,600
reason we're all here is is Jupiter

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,479
Jupiter is the glue that holds together

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,659
this open access to data and methods and

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,220
code and so with that let's move on to

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,399
some examples of artificial intelligence

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,829
in scientific discovery but before we do

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,290
I want to make one important distinction

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,290
and that is between machine automation

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,630
and machine discovery so machine

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,590
automation is focused on previously

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,750
observed outcomes

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,630
well discovery is focused on the search

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,740
for the novel or the unknown both are

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,290
incredibly important

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,960
however discovery requires even more

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,860
amounts of data and more complexity of

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,300
algorithms in reality I think that the

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,560
two of these things are actually a

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,060
continuum

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,400
but these are the examples that I'll

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,860
show you are spaced out along this

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:26,250
continuum so let's begin with an example

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,500
from my background as part of the drug

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,630
discovery process often a scientist

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,970
wants to study their drug in the

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,489
presence of a target such as an enzyme

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,380
and one of the ways that we do this is

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,440
we grow them together in a crystal we

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,760
create a crystal of our enzyme and our

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,980
drug complex and so we have to test many

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,370
conditions to get this to work and so we

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,470
set up a tray much like you see here but

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,100
we don't just set up one tray we set up

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,230
many many trays and each of these trays

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,269
has to be checked regularly for the

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,299
presence of tiny crystals inside those

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,940
wells I did this as a graduate student

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:10,200
and it was painful it was time-consuming

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:12,810
and it was painful and one might think

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,790
why can't we automate this and and many

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,280
have thought that it's a challenging

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,230
computer vision problem as you can see

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,840
in the top row the presence of crystals

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,940
can be really really subtle the bottom

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,260
rows don't contain any crystals but yeah

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,470
you can also see the wells are pretty

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,390
heterogeneous however a team of

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,090
researchers shown at the bottom has

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,040
finally gotten this to work with deep

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,200
learning and this project is called

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,100
marco machine recognition of

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,450
crystallization outcomes and so it's

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,920
deciding graduate students and

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,750
scientists of the future will no longer

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,870
have to spend hours checking their

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,970
crystal trays they may also not have to

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,040
set up their trays there are companies

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,799
like open Tron's located right here in

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,980
new york that sell robots which can be

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,510
programmed to set up scientific

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,079
experiments much like these crystal

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,959
trays so you can see the the liquids

00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,670
being transferred in the little tray

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,859
collectively these these make me feel

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,389
almost like a dinosaur and I didn't

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:16,859
graduate from grad school that long ago

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:20,760
so harkening back to the importance of

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,349
data marco has all of the training tests

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,150
and validation data available for

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:27,060
download and their model has been

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,500
incorporated directly into tensorflow

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,010
probably one of the advantages of having

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,260
someone from Google on your team open

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,360
Tron's also has an API which is

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,610
completely which is available directly

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,470
on github and they have a website where

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,150
researchers can exchange and discuss

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,840
protocols with each other that they've

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,550
developed again the open flow of

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,160
information is what has made this

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:56,760
possible for our next example let's move

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,650
to outer space our solar system is not

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,450
the only one in the universe there are

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,430
many many others including Kepler 90

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,850
until recently Kepler was known to have

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,470
only seven planets however researchers

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,780
from Google brain and the University of

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,200
Texas detected an eighth planet

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,479
an exoplanet and they did this using

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,350
artificial intelligence and data from

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,240
the from NASA and I want to make a point

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,940
about how challenging this was this is

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,010
an example of raw data from the Kepler

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,440
satellite you can see it's incredibly

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,180
noisy and we have to do a lot of

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,340
normalization and baseline correction

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,720
with this data and even when we do

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,140
there's going to be a lot of false

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,470
positives that we have to sort through

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,880
lots and lots of pre-processing so

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,770
here's an example of what the pre

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,370
process or the process data looks like

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:52,020
and what the researchers are detecting

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,190
so you can see as this this new eight

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,229
planets transits around the Kepler 90

00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,320
the center of the Sun the intensity

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,780
decreases so the flux decreases just

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,550
momentarily and so the researchers were

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,190
able to train a neural network to detect

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,039
this and they didn't detect just one

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:16,650
exoplanet they detected a second in a

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:19,200
different solar system Kepler ADG so

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,210
this this model is also available in

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,860
tensorflow

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,660
and NASA has been truly one of the

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,450
leaders in making its data open and

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,100
available to the public so all of this

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,590
is available for download via the

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,720
exoplanet archive so you can literally

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,060
explore outer space and make discoveries

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,510
in your own living room I think that's

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,510
pretty amazing

00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,609
for our next example let's move back

00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,549
into the pharmaceutical space

00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:49,159
so besides understanding our target and

00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:52,099
our drug in complex together chemists

00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:55,399
have to synthesize the drug before it

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:58,699
can be tested and much like exploring

00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:01,729
outer space the universe of molecules is

00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:04,099
vast there are an estimate of 10 to the

00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:07,849
60 possible drugs and by some estimates

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:10,129
even 10 to the 300 kamas have only

00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:13,009
synthesized about ten to eight to the

00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:15,349
eighth of these molecules if we were to

00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:18,319
map the molecular universe to the

00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:19,789
surface of Earth the number of chemicals

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,869
that we've synthesized would be smaller

00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:26,119
than a New York City Taxi Cab vast space

00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:27,709
that we have to search this is this is

00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,839
this is why artificial intelligence

00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:33,589
makes these problems tractable this is

00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:35,239
incredibly challenging so here's an

00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:36,559
example of an Alzheimer's drug

00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:38,389
intermedia and this is from the paper

00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:41,029
published at the ball at the bottom of

00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,399
the slide so a chemist might want to

00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:46,360
synthesize this to study to study the

00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:49,909
possibility of using this as a drug and

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,459
so to do so the chemist has to devise a

00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:56,239
whole pathway to create this drug and

00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:58,569
along this pathway every compound has to

00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:01,669
either be synthesizable or purchasable

00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:06,049
so this is an in this is a vast vast

00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:07,610
search space and what chemists usually

00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:09,139
do is they work backwards so they know

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,369
what their final compound is and then

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,889
they work backwards to the beginning

00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:16,099
again within the constraints of this

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:17,539
this process has to be creative has to

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:20,989
be there purchasable for the compounds

00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:25,159
or synthesizable huge possible it's a

00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:27,349
massive space to search so for his

00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,019
thesis work one of my colleagues at

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:32,089
benevolent AI Marwan Ziegler wondered if

00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:34,300
if artificial intelligence could be used

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,709
to automate this retro-synthetic pathway

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,509
he wasn't the first person to think this

00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:40,610
though or wonder chemists have been

00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:43,490
trying to automate the logic of chemical

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,559
synthesis for over 60 years and there

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,899
are simply too many edge cases and too

00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:51,889
many exceptions for a human to capture

00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,390
effectively but Marwan decided to use a

00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:56,300
cleverly feature

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:59,330
dataset and some deep deep learning

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:03,650
models and using that he was able to get

00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:06,620
this to work in a couple of months the

00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:08,510
the pathway that you see above his his

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,430
his artificial intelligence model

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,870
reproduced it exactly as it was

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,920
published and it was not part of the

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:18,260
training data they also showed pathways

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,080
for synthesis created by the artificial

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,610
intelligence model and by chemists two

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,810
other chemists and they couldn't

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,810
distinguish between the two

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:35,000
so recently researchers have taken this

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,800
one step further a group from the

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,720
University of Glasgow has developed an

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,300
automatically automated system for

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,350
compound synthesis and they they call

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,130
this they want to call this the the

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,890
Spotify of compound synthesis so imagine

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,380
an AI where we can just dial up whatever

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,450
compound we want the the synthetic

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,300
pathway is determined for us and it's

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,130
created amazing think about all the all

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,380
the other things but we had scientists

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:05,090
could think about when some when those

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:06,860
tasks are taken care of for us and so

00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,360
having shown you those three

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,940
applications of artificial intelligence

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,650
to scientific research I want to leave

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,340
you with a parting thought about the

00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:18,290
future of this field Hiraki caetano has

00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:23,120
posed a grand challenge in artificial

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,960
intelligence to use AI to make a Nobel

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,390
prize-worthy

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,540
discovery in the biomedical sciences

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:32,570
this may seem flamboyant or overly

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,370
ambitious but I don't think so I think

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,520
it's an absolute requirement for the

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:40,220
continued future of scientific discovery

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:43,850
why do I think that one scientific paper

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,940
is published every 30 seconds every 30

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,670
seconds we as researchers cannot

00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,340
comprehend that vast amount of

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,200
information and as science progresses we

00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,880
are going to need to be able to have an

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,980
increasingly broad view of this

00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,490
information so to continue to progress

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,350
as a field science doesn't just need or

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:07,330
want the assistance of AI we must have

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,330
it it's an absolute requirement

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:14,080
thank you very much

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,080
[Applause]

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,900
