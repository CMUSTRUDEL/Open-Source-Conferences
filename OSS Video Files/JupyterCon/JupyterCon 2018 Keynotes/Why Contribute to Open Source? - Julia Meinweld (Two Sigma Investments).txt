	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
so thank you so much for having me here

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,109
I'm gonna start with a very exciting

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,570
legal disclaimer this basically says

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,490
that I'm not gonna try to solicit anyone

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,259
to invest with two sigma and I'm not

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,630
gonna be giving any investment advice

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,140
and that should be super clear as I keep

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,289
talking so for someone who shares a name

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,449
with a programming language I am a real

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,150
newcomer to the field of open source

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,510
technology as Fernando mentioned I come

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,480
from the world of music but I've been

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,980
really touched and honored how warm and

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,590
welcoming and friendly everyone in this

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,750
community has been in terms of talking

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,850
to me answering questions and really

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,030
making me feel part of a group so thank

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,190
you all for that so I've ended the

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,829
company to Sigma for about eight years I

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,930
started as a receptionist or if you're

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,989
an anagram fan which I am a telephone

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,640
girl repeating hello and after working

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,890
in reception I worked in the learning

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,199
and development team and about two years

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,760
ago I was ready for a change so I took a

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,979
position that was brand new to me and

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,369
brand new to the company I became two

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,590
Sigma's first open source coordinator so

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,780
at first it was counterintuitive to me

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,280
that two sigma a company in the finance

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,890
space could have an open source

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,640
coordinator or could be involved in open

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,560
source at all we are in the business of

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,380
intellectual property and we've got

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,619
robust security systems redundant

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,000
servers and we put a lot of thought into

00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:32,400
how to keep information inside the

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,659
company and this is for good reason

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,630
because we have a fiduciary

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,220
responsibility to our investors and even

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,680
if we're not gonna go open sourcing

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,210
model code if we put out anything that

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,579
could be perceived as giving away a

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,259
competitive advantage that could have a

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,259
negative effect on someone's pension

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,610
fund so we take that seriously and I

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,500
think even companies that don't have

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,780
this sense of fiduciary responsibility

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,700
still need to grapple with this idea of

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,960
protecting competitive advantage when

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,149
they think about how to get involved in

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,560
open source so today I'm gonna talk

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,810
about three things I'm gonna talk about

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,399
some of the risks and hurdles that to

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,710
sigmah had to think about before we

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,149
could get involved the reasons we

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,210
decided it was worth it to get involved

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,830
anyway and then

00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,410
finally a couple of specific things that

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:17,470
we did so starting with some history for

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,380
our first decade as a company to Sigma

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,240
we used open source we were enthusiastic

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,980
about open source and in fact one of our

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,010
founding members was a contributor to

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,900
BSD which is cool but we weren't really

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,990
contributing anything back

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,850
it wasn't until 2012 that the passion

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,350
around open source got strong enough

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,600
that we sort of came together as a

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,880
company to figure out how we could be a

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,590
part of this community safely so people

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,450
from marketing people from legal from

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,570
security engineers from all around got

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:50,410
together and we created an open source

00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:52,780
committee and their job was to design an

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,490
approval process for how we could commit

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,380
could safely and then administer that

00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:00,250
process and as you can see in the

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,840
timeline we after we started being

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,340
involved in this world we started open

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,600
sourcing a bunch of projects that we

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,580
created in-house which I'll talk a

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,840
little bit more about later and we

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,550
started making some substantial

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,640
contributions to existing open source

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,740
products so that we did not take this

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,370
lightly it was a big deal for us in

00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,990
addition to IP likud risks we also had

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,730
to think about just employee time

00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,290
anytime that our employees are spending

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,030
working on open source is time that

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,890
they're not working on internal projects

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,680
so we think a lot about the burden of

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,240
support about this idea that if we put

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,930
an open source contribution out there

00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,910
and it's lucky enough to find followers

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,590
and people who use it if we ever then

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,810
stop using that product within the

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,900
company we're in this weird position of

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,210
either supporting something that we

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,790
don't even use or abandoning something

00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,290
that other people use which is not nice

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,020
to those users and doesn't make us look

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,420
very good we also in terms of

00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,580
reputational risks worry about just

00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,440
putting our name on software that might

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:06,340
not be of the highest quality that's

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:08,350
something we wouldn't want or even say I

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,620
just had a total blank the stage is so

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,620
big

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,989
reputational risk opening of bad

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,970
software or even putting a software that

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,760
might not be needed that might be

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,709
divisive to the community so despite all

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,210
those risks we did think that the

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,790
benefits make it worth it so I'm gonna

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,470
talk about six main benefits the first

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,139
and the most obvious one is leveraging

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,550
other people's work it's just sort of

00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,530
universally efficient so that if

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,150
something exists that might be able to

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,700
do what we need to do instead of

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,229
reinventing the wheel we can help

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,090
improve a product that's already out

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,620
there and this also is useful because

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,800
that way we can take advantage of

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,910
experts who we might not have in-house

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,430
one of the big ones for us is the

00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,530
opportunity to shape a product or even

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,970
shape the whole ecosystem and for two

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,970
sigma one of the biggest examples of

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:58,430
this is Jupiter so we had created a

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,050
notebook in house called beaker it's a

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,210
polyglot notebook and we had a lot of

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,910
beaker users in the company and outside

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:08,240
of it but we also had a lot of Jupiter

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:11,810
users and as we saw ipython and Jupiter

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,090
grow and have this huge community around

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,130
it and get more and more users more and

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,260
more contributors we found it harder and

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,450
harder to keep up with development with

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,030
beaker so we were in a tough spot

00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:25,310
because we put a lot of work and energy

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,710
into creating beaker and figure had a

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,750
lot of unique features that we needed

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,979
that weren't available interpreter but

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,810
at the same time we didn't think it was

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,479
sustainable to keep working on this

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,000
product when we were only a few people

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:41,210
in the company and Jupiter had this huge

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,610
community behind it so we pivoted we

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,120
turned beaker into a set of extensions

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,590
for Jupiter called beaker X and when we

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,630
did this we worked really closely with

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,820
the Jupiter community because it was

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,289
important to us not to fork Jupiter and

00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,270
sort of have our own private Jupiter

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,389
with the features we needed we wanted to

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,010
be a part of this community so we worked

00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:02,990
with all the core contributors to align

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,960
the roadmaps and now we have all the

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,180
features we needed from beaker in

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,849
Jupiter and hopefully other Jupiter

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,130
users can enjoy them as well when you're

00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:15,979
creating open source you're creating a

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,690
common language if everyone is using

00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,710
these same tools it's easy to

00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,539
collaborate with each other right away

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,159
so this is helpful for things like

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,150
hiring if you're bringing someone into

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:24,080
the company

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,270
you don't need to spend all this time

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,740
training them on proprietary systems if

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,190
we're all working on the same thing

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,190
already

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,860
um open-source also helps protect you

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,230
from the Galapagos effect this idea that

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,030
if you know that you have the best piece

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,070
of software on the little island that is

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,120
your company it's easy to fool yourself

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,870
to thinking that that's the best thing

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,240
in the world super important reason to

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:51,470
be cool I can't stress enough how much I

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:54,620
personally would like to be cool not

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,210
super invested in my quest but two sigma

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,210
as a company they want to be cool too

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,790
because we want to hire the best most

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,260
exciting greatest engineers and we find

00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,390
that a lot of the people we really want

00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,810
to work with are really passionate about

00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:11,060
open source the legacy that we want to

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,490
Sigma as a company is to be people who

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,410
tackle the hardest problems and we find

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,820
that these days a lot of the most

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,430
interesting hardest problems are

00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,380
actually too big for a single company to

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,060
make real progress on so by

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,100
collaborating in the open-source world

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,320
we get to dig our teeth into interesting

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,280
work like I seen is also interesting

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,320
from the point of view of a single

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,870
engineer because if you're doing good

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,340
work on a project within a company it's

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,710
satisfying and your colleagues will know

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,110
about it but to have that work seen by

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:42,070
the entire world is even more rewarding

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,850
and speaking of the entire world

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,620
fundamentally we do just think that

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,540
making progress on products that

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,670
everyone can use makes the world a

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,840
better place

00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,790
so let's think for a second about what a

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,940
day without open-source would look like

00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:58,520
at 2 Sigma we use so much open source we

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:01,070
use pandas and Jupiter and numpy for

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,290
analysis to name just a few we use spark

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,660
for distributed compute these get to

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,850
store our code and if all of these

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,250
products that we depend on we're not

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,560
there all of a sudden things would sort

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,660
of grind to a halt and we're not the

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,250
only ones there's probably not a company

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,490
in the fortune 500 that doesn't at least

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,840
depend on Linux servers we all rely on

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,430
these things and I think a lot of

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,490
companies would be in a lot of trouble

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:28,040
if they weren't there for us which

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,020
brings me to probably the most important

00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,280
flight of my talk it's a little blurry

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,630
there the digital public infrastructure

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,599
isn't free

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:42,380
it's not invulnerable unfortunately wide

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,540
use does not equal wide support if you

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,000
take something like numpy they just got

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,370
their first grants last summer from the

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,170
Moore Foundation if you look at pandas

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,420
they've got close to 30 million

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,520
downloads and they're really being

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,070
sustained by the work of about ten core

00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,080
collaborators a lot of these projects we

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,150
rely on are much more fragile than we

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,180
want to admit and keeping them strong

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:08,090
takes people's time it takes energy and

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,920
it takes money so this is a relatively

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,750
new problem that we're having to deal

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,820
with as a community but the time is

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,710
coming when we need to figure out who is

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,980
going to step up and take responsibility

00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,660
for keeping these project healthy so it

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,240
reminds me like carol was saying of the

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,980
bystander effect this idea that if

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,650
someone needs help and there's a bunch

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,300
of people around who could help it's not

00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,920
clear why any one of them should be the

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,300
one to do it and I think this is

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,430
happening with a lot of companies with

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,590
open source we all know that we use it

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,570
and that we depend on it but I don't

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,940
know how many people have decided that

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:44,240
they should be the ones to really step

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,910
up and put power behind it my contention

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,790
is that it is in a company's own best

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,340
interest to be giving resources to open

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,860
source so while T Sigma does not have a

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,110
magic way of seeing the future as per my

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,470
helpful disclaimer we are in the

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,480
business of making predictions we take

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,570
in as much information as we can and we

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,040
try to use that to be smart about what

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,710
we think the world is going to look like

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,810
and this can come in the small term

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,820
decisions like how a stock price is

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,220
going to move but can also come in the

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,720
form of larger decisions like what we

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,270
think the technological landscape is

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,710
going to look like ten years from now so

00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,560
when we incorporate an open-source

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,440
project into our tech stack we build all

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,820
around it and we're basically implicitly

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,790
forecasting that we think that that

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,430
product is going to stick around so

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,080
luckily we can affect the future in this

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,760
regard we don't have to just cross our

00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,070
fingers and hope that the projects that

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,780
we use will be there if we invest in

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:45,470
them now we can protect our own

00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,880
technological advancement so there's a

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,820
couple of ways that T Sigma is trying to

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,910
do this

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,100
one way is open sourcing tools that we

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,590
think will make the whole open-source

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,090
landscape a little bit richer so the one

00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,580
I want to talk about today is Flint

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:03,060
Flint is a library for a time series

00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,710
analysis on using spark and this was a

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,260
tough one for us because time series

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,930
analysis is pretty close to our core

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,720
business so the intellectual property

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:15,030
question was at play but what finally

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,310
pushed us over the edge was the fact

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,680
that we are really invested in spark we

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,480
use spark we want that project to stick

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,950
around and we thought that by open

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,890
sourcing something that would make spark

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,750
more useful to more people that would

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,820
help future-proof spark

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,230
we've also got a bunch of other open

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,880
source project we've generated I won't

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,360
talk about them all right now but you

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,400
can check them out at 2 Sigma iOS so

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,230
another great way that companies can

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,720
help keep the open source you can system

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,300
strong is by paying developers to work

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,340
on open source projects so we've got a

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,590
bunch of open stores open source

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,570
rockstars at 2 Sigma we've got Geoffrey

00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,810
back we've got Philip cloud we've got

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:58,080
Darian from Jupiter lab and these people

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,660
spend most of their time at 2 Sigma

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,430
working on open source projects we also

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,110
do a bit of event programming to try to

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,630
get more people involved in open source

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,300
our biggest one is probably we do this

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,880
annual hackathon the TS open and for

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,320
that we pick a project we've done pandas

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,140
we've done two for their most recently

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,850
we did scikit-learn and we'll work with

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,460
poor contributors from that project to

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,080
curate an issue list of things that

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,390
could be tackled in a single day and

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,830
maybe things that could be tackled by

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,960
someone who's never contributed to

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,210
open-source before so our goals with the

00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,680
hackathon are of course to hopefully

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,050
help out the project for contributing to

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,540
but also to try to convert more to Sigma

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,150
people into open-source developers and

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,490
finally we also engage contractors

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,160
outside the company who we will pay for

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,740
engagement to work on open-source

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,710
projects that we think would like some

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,230
so right so finally we look to

00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:54,330
organizations like num focus for cues to

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,860
how best to help the community in case

00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,720
anyone doesn't know and I'm focused who

00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,760
is a sponsor of this conference is a

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,170
nonprofit that supports open source

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,059
scientific computing

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,160
and in addition of to helping to raise

00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:07,170
funds for open source projects they also

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,420
provide financial and legal

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,759
infrastructure which is really helpful

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,470
if these huge projects have as few

00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,639
people as they do supporting them they

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,639
might not have the bandwidth for this

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,980
sort of infrastructure to thing that is

00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,809
a gold sponsor of non focus and we're

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,449
really really proud to be associated

00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:26,189
with such a cool group so that's the end

00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:29,129
of my time here's a bunch of ways to

00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:31,399
contact me and the two Sigma or you can

00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:34,350
check out our other open source products

00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,079
I'm around all weekend and we're always

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,669
looking for ways to be more helpful so

00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,649
please come up and check with me

00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:41,160
anything I hope everyone enjoys after

00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:41,900
the conference

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,400
thank you

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,400
[Applause]
