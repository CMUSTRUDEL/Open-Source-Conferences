Title: Jupyter & Gravitational Waves - Will Farr (Stony Brook University)
Publication date: 2020-08-26
Playlist: JupyterCon 2018 Keynotes
Description: 
	In 2015, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration announced the first-ever detection of gravitational waves from the merger of a pair of stellar-mass black holes about 1.5 billion light-years away. This signal, dubbed GW150914, marked the beginning of the era of gravitational wave astronomy; the field has exploded in the three years since, with five more black hole mergers announced, the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to three founders of the LIGO project, and the first detection of a merger of neutron stars in August 2017.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
I'm gonna open with a story which will

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,849
hopefully explain my somewhat unusual

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,590
title so I earned my PhD in 2010 and

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,960
shortly thereafter joined LIGO I was a

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,809
postdoc at Northwestern and one of the

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,220
graduate students there been far he's no

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,590
relation of mine but were frequent

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,380
collaborators so it's a bit confusing

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,670
been far was making a plot as one does

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,900
as a graduate student to show the

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,240
postdoc here's this cool thing I've been

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,960
doing and he opens up a terminal window

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,170
and he fires up Python and suddenly it's

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,809
colors and he starts typing things and

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,210
and little autocomplete tips come up and

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,980
you know documentation for the functions

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,950
is appearing as he's typing and I am

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,950
just gobsmacked and that of course was

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,770
ipython and the reason I'm telling you

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,469
this story is because you know all of

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,840
these tools Jupiter among them that

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,809
everyone here likes to use really burst

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,640
on the scene from my perspective it

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,260
feels like at the same time that

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,090
gravitational wave astronomy was

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,070
accelerating and growing and becoming

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,119
the big thing that it is now and so they

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,189
sort of grew up together

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,770
and everything that I've learned about

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,799
them has been because some cool kid like

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,750
Ben has said hey look at this and there

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,330
we go so most of the plots that you'll

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,810
see in this talk were produced with

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,670
matplotlib many of them were done in

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,310
Jupiter notebooks that we share around

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,960
amongst ourselves internally and also

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,340
externally and at the end of the talk

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,220
we'll give you a website where you can

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,299
download data from the LIGO detectors

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,520
notebooks that will teach you how to use

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,380
that data how to run analyses on it just

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,900
like we do and even produce some of the

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,460
plots that you'll see the day so what

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,369
it's like oh I'm a member of the LIGO

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,680
scientific collaboration it's of order a

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,409
thousand astronomers physicists

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,920
engineers computer scientists across the

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,780
globe you can see the logos here and as

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,350
you would imagine coordinating such a

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,329
thing is a bit of a herding cats problem

00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,430
and it's very helpful to us to be able

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,619
to share efficiently results of

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,369
calculations computations etc and

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,289
Jupiter and this open source

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:12,420
universe of computational tools that's

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,850
grown-up that it's a part of is a big

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,440
part of what makes us

00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,610
successful and is very useful to us and

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,120
communicating our results to our

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,910
colleagues you may have heard of like oh

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,610
it was recently in the news three early

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:29,780
members of LIGO the founders of the the

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:32,210
group won the Nobel Prize in 2017 for

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,480
their work getting conceiving of the

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,340
experiment and the detector and planning

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,460
the early physics and shepherding the

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,170
growth of the the collaboration and also

00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,870
the instrument to the phenomenal

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,330
discoveries that that happened

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,800
so I said gravitational wave astronomy

00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,900
is a young field

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,700
well astronomically it's young because

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,820
it's only been going for 40 or 50 years

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,300
but in terms of results it's also very

00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,580
young it really kicked off in 2015 I'm

00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,330
showing you a plot here this is

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,520
September 14th 2015 and we'll just focus

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,830
on the top two panels that is a data

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,480
readout from two LIGO detectors one in

00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,140
Hanford Washington one in Livingston

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,180
Louisiana and the Livingston plot also

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,030
shows the Hanford data and slightly

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,500
lighter color in back of it and the

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,180
noticeable thing here is there seems to

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,650
be a signal in the detectors it grows

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,290
over the course of about a tenth of a

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,680
second oscillates up and down and then

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:34,720
dies away and it appears coherently in

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,310
the two detectors very nearby in time

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,140
that is a gravitational wave it was the

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,330
first ever gravitational wave detected

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:48,530
we call the source GW 1509 14 because

00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:49,760
imaginatively that's the bait we know

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,930
one of the reasons we know it's a

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,640
gravitational wave as we saw it

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,760
simultaneously and two detectors that

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,510
are across the United States

00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,140
another reason we know it's a

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:04,970
gravitational wave comes from the second

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:08,270
row of panels here and in in that row

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,860
there are three curves shown and they I

00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,880
think they both show the physics but

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,180
they also highlight sort of the

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:18,890
Sociology that I want to talk about here

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:22,280
the the widest band there comes from an

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:24,979
analysis conducted on a supercomputer in

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,540
the traditional physics way you submit a

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:27,650
batch script it gets shipped into a

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,449
scheduler

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,300
is off a bunch of jobs they communicate

00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:35,630
through MPI etc and the widest band

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,400
tries to reconstruct the signal that was

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,240
in common between the two

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,979
interferometers that's it just what do I

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,660
see that is consistent in both

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:46,190
interferometers and you can see it

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,350
tracks the data in each interferometer

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,770
well that tells us there was something

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:54,020
coherent happening in the two it's a

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,289
little bit hard to see but the next most

00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:00,560
narrow band is again a supercomputer

00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:02,990
calculation but here it uses decades and

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,590
decades and decades of research into

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,139
analytical approximations to solutions

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:12,260
to the general relativistic field

00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:15,199
equations that describe merging binary

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,970
black holes so this is the kind of thing

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,419
that you can write down the formulas for

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,580
that curve in a few hundred lines of

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:24,349
computer code but they're meant to

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,210
approximate the solution to these

00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:29,000
partial differential equations in three

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,639
space and one time dimension and that

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,860
band is the range of reconstructed

00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,479
signals that are permitted under that

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,789
approximation you can see it tracks the

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,380
data really well as well that suggests

00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:42,320
this is a pair of merging binary black

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,190
holes the final curve the solid red line

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,020
is hundreds of thousands of CPU hours of

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,030
numerical solutions direct numerical

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,180
solutions of Einstein's general

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,789
relativistic field equations and that is

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,590
as best we can determine the real signal

00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:00,320
that binary black holes would produce

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,419
one of them weighs 30 times the mass of

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,310
the Sun the other one weighs 40 times

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,169
the mass the Sun they're about the size

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,210
of Manhattan they crash into each other

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:12,409
at about half the speed of light

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:17,270
and that curve tracks the data really

00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:19,729
well as well okay what are these

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,770
detectors how does this all work okay

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm not gonna try to give a physics

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,860
lesson here but there's gonna be a

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,289
little bit of physics you'll have to

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,000
excuse me I'm an astrophysicist so I

00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:31,039
showed you a data stream but where does

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,199
it come from it comes from Hanford

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,510
Washington and Livingston Louisiana two

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,310
detectors the detectors are

00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,320
interferometers but really what they're

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,300
doing is they're measuring distortions

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,949
in space and time we now

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,789
no thanks to Einstein that gravity is

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:49,009
really distorted space and time and just

00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:52,400
like one produces electromagnetic waves

00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:54,080
by wiggling charges you wiggle a charge

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,300
the disturbance propagates in the

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,009
electromagnetic field it wiggles charges

00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,900
in an antenna which go into a receiver

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:03,190
and out comes music okay that's

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:07,970
electromagnetic waves you wiggle masses

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:10,280
it perturbs space-time that disturbance

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,039
propagates in the space and time fields

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,669
it arrives at your detector and wiggles

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:19,370
masses and you read out the result so

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:22,759
what we have built here is a space and

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,919
time measuring device which is really

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,120
just some freely hanging mirrors and

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,770
when the wave comes through the mirrors

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,150
move and all of the laser interferometer

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,830
technology which is phenomenal and I

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,139
don't have time to spend any time on it

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,090
other didn't say it's phenomenal goes

00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,330
into just measuring the length of those

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:45,349
arms to a precision that's about one one

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,960
thousandth of an atomic nucleus so this

00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:51,770
device is four kilometers long okay

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:55,130
miles long and we measure the motion of

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:59,750
the end pieces to ten to the minus 18

00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:08,180
meters and that is the signal that's

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:10,969
recorded here so LIGO observed after the

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:16,190
15 or 914 event for another three months

00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:19,279
and recorded 1.9 more signals one

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,830
happened just after Christmas of 2015

00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,659
and one that it was probably but not

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,879
certainly a gravitational wave this one

00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:28,219
we think has an about a 95% chance of

00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,409
being a gravitational wave that one

00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:33,110
happened in October of 2015 and that

00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,579
LIGO turned off improvements were made

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,490
it got more sensitive to turn back on in

00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:40,430
2017 and we recorded two more signals

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,839
one in January one in August and in fact

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,750
we published a third signal that

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:49,779
happened in June and then last August

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:54,350
something happened so this is showing

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:55,230
all of the signals and and a final

00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,020
signal that came

00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,130
August 17th and of course the first

00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,540
thing you notice is that one is much

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,790
longer the other signals are a few

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:07,860
seconds this one it's 50 seconds 60

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:09,420
seconds 100 seconds that signal is the

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,100
signal you would expect not from merging

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,400
black holes but from merging neutron

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,250
stars why is that cool well black holes

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,230
are made of gravity when they merge they

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,990
make a whopping big gravitational signal

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,490
and nothing else so for traditional

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,570
astronomers say I get to call myself an

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,700
astronomer now because we've seen

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,590
sources previously I would have said I'm

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,150
a physicist or an astrophysicist but

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,730
traditional astronomers that kind of use

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,740
regular telescopes they look at light

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,470
electromagnetic radiation and they don't

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,210
get anything from black holes but

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,640
neutron stars are made of matter so when

00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:46,320
they slam into each other they can make

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,690
light and this system did make light in

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,850
fact this is the title of a paper multi

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,080
messenger observations of a binary

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,330
neutron star merger that means

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,640
gravitational waves and electromagnetic

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,050
radiation

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,170
LIGO has about a thousand people in it

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:05,790
this paper had three thousand-plus

00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:08,490
authors and was one of some 60 papers

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,930
that appeared coordinated in their

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,010
release on the day we announced this

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:15,420
event almost two months after we saw the

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,700
analysis and observations here involves

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,970
something like a third of the global

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:23,700
astronomical community the event was

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,530
detected within a day of the

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,810
gravitational wave signal in fact we saw

00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,000
a gamma rays from it two seconds after

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,830
the gravitational wave signal proving

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,810
that light and gravity travel at the

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:36,870
same speed to fantastically good

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,400
precision but in the optical those six

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,770
panels that I'm showing there are from

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,240
different instruments and you can see

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,010
inside the cross there's a little bright

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
dot I'm not showing it to you but if

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,800
you'd looked at that part of the sky a

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,320
week earlier you would not have seen

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,030
that bright dot that bright dot is the

00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,740
explosion that resulted when the two

00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,980
neutron stars slammed into each other

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,300
again at near the speed of light and by

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,540
analyzing the properties that we now

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,770
know these events which spew out Neutron

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,500
rich right neutron stars are made of

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,800
neutrons spew out high density very hot

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,449
Neutron rich matter form basically all

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:16,000
of the heavy L

00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:19,000
including gold uranium everything

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,589
heavier than iron in the universe is

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,760
probably formed from these sorts of

00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:23,760
mergers and we know that now

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:30,040
another fun thing you can do if you have

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,630
light as well as gravitational waves the

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,690
strength of the gravitational waves

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,250
tells you how far away the event is we

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,899
know how bright neutron stars in our

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,730
intrinsically in gravitational waves

00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:41,230
from the amplitude of the signal where

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,600
you receive we can calculate the

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,089
distance if you have light you can

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,820
measure a redshift so you might be

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:51,459
familiar with Hubble's law this is a

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,139
plot from Hubble's original paper Hubble

00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:55,360
is famous for many things but among them

00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:57,100
noticing that as he looked at more

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,110
distant galaxies this was in the early

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,670
20th century people had just realized

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,130
there was a whole universe out there the

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,279
Milky Way was just one galaxy in it when

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:09,760
you look at these more distant galaxies

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:12,040
they seem to be moving away faster as if

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,510
the universe were expanding of course

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,610
today we know the universe is expanding

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,399
and its rate of expansion is called the

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,970
Hubble constant in honor of Hubble's

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,680
discovery of the phenomenon if you can

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,170
measure a distance that's the thing that

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,350
goes on the x-axis of this plot and a

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,060
velocity a recessional velocity by

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,829
looking at red shifted lines in the

00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,089
light then you can make this sort of

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,560
plot and the slope of that line is the

00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:37,209
Hubble constant it tells you the age of

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,949
the universe it tells you the size of

00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:41,949
the universe it's a fundamental property

00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:44,740
of the universe and we can do that with

00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:46,510
gravitational waves so here is Hubble's

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,819
plot on the top and then on the bottom

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,589
the little square shows you the distance

00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:52,959
range over which Hubble was operating

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:55,389
now gravitational waves stretch much

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,699
further and our first measurement shows

00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:59,920
up right there and that cross it was at

00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:01,870
about 40 mega parsecs that's 120

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,190
light-years away the recessional

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,079
velocity was measured from the

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,060
electromagnetic radiation and we

00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,639
calculate the Hubble constant to be

00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,100
about 70 in units that astronomers like

00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,050
to use now we actually already knew that

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,699
there are lots of electromagnetic

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,800
observations that give you the Hubble

00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:19,630
constant and if you take the range of

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,269
slopes of that line and you turn it into

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,760
a plot you get this plot the blue curve

00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,170
there give

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,850
you what we think the probability

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,800
density is for the Hubble constant peaks

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,900
at 70 but it could be 90 could be 60

00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,680
those two bands are competing

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,710
electromagnetic measurements and they

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,550
are currently much more precise than our

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,880
measurement

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,380
however they disagree one of them looks

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,030
at the early universe and measures the

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,260
size of the universe and gets one answer

00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,970
and one of them looks at the nearby

00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,210
universe and measures the size the

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,050
universe gets a different answer as

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,490
gravitational waves as more

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,850
gravitational waves and these events are

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:58,550
detected that curve will narrow and we

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,230
may be able to choose between the early

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,420
universe and the local universe

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,630
measurements and that could be a hint to

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,550
new cosmological physics to bring things

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,040
back around to Jupiter as I'm closing

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,320
this is just a screenshot in case you

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,180
were wondering almost all of these plots

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,920
as I said are made and made and shared

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,420
in Jupiter notebooks that's a screenshot

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,410
of the Jupiter notebook that produced

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:23,030
the plot that I was just showing you and

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,490
if you want to see more of them and you

00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:28,160
want to play with Lego data and you'd

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,960
like to run tutorial notebooks or run

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,840
notebooks that reproduce our actual

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,920
analysis etc etc etc it's called the

00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,140
LIGO open Science Center and there it is

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,480
thanks very much

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,480
