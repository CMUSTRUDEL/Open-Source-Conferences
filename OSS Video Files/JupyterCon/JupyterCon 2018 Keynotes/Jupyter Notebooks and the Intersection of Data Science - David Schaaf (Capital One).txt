	00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,270
complexity we see that everything we do

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,580
look no further than the last time that

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,960
you file your income taxes or you had a

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,349
similar furniture that you purchased

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,759
from Ikea the reality is in today's

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,310
world sometimes it's simply impossible

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,810
to get things done without help at least

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,900
in the case of taxes you didn't go to

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,519
H&R block or you can go and hire your

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,710
local CPA and they can help you get

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,320
through the process in the case of IKEA

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,179
and my own personal experience I'd say I

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,410
don't have any help for that those

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,390
instructions are impossible to

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,620
understand and I never seem to be able

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,540
to assemble the furniture the right way

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,579
ever with that said in the tax space the

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,160
tools that we use to do our taxes

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,440
continue to improve year after year this

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,059
year I filed my taxes online and I can

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,829
tell you that the experience was so much

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,719
better than it been in the past even

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,820
though I had to file more complex forms

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,469
and I had needed to do in past years and

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,050
it was very simple for me to go step by

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,239
step and if I needed help then I could

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,480
go and use online help and were to get

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,339
myself unstuck this complexity and the

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,250
opportunities for simplicity are also

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,600
evident in the data and analytics space

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,900
just like going and hiring a CPA

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,299
are you using one of those tools online

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,520
then we need to make sure that we

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,409
organized in the data and analytic space

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,200
in such a way that we have the right

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,680
people the right process and the right

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,570
tools that get the job done this is the

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,549
value in Jupiter and we we finally

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,640
intersection in data science and data

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,470
engineering throughout my career I've

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,750
been primarily focused on data in some

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,939
foreign fashion and more recently at

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,650
Capitol wine I've started managing our

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,140
data engineering teams that focus on

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,530
building tools to help our users give

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,640
some insight to action more quickly

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,070
throughout my career I've encountered

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,270
increasing complexity and the reality is

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,920
the problems that we face today are

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,780
simply more challenging than they used

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,759
to be in the past and like this cartoon

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,340
it seems more more difficult to actually

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,170
explain what you're doing in the data

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,340
engineering space and vice versa when

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,189
others explain things to me like

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,469
principal component analysis or neural

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,300
networks sometimes my eyes glaze over

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,860
and I just simply don't understand what

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,569
they're talking about these are

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,920
difficult areas to understand and you

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,230
need to have the right talents tact

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,450
against it so today I really like to

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,489
talk about three things the first thing

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,340
is complexity equals ever greater

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:26,340
challenges the second is the data

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,440
scientist plus data engineers and other

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,100
folks in the data professions equals

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:35,040
success and finally Jupiter can be at

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,239
the center of it all and the modern

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,310
world the challenges that we face

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,560
continue to grow in breadth and scope in

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,810
turn we have to have larger and larger

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,269
organizations organized around those

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,910
problems in order to get the job done it

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,590
used to be that in the past if we look

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,590
at the progress of scientific progress

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,120
over history then individuals were the

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,890
primary drivers of scientific

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,620
advancement whether you talk about da

00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,910
Vinci Newton or Galileo then over time

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,310
has probably became more and more

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,110
complex than team of researchers had to

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,930
be aligned against these problems like

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,459
the team that discovered DNA and then as

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,890
we got into the 20th century the

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,140
ambitions that we had as a society were

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,120
so significant that we had to stack

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,459
enormous organizations against these and

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,930
the tens of thousands of people in the

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,690
case of the Manhattan Project an

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,890
estimated 130,000 people worked on the

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,650
Manhattan Project in order to produce

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,040
the a-bomb and the case of sending a man

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,600
of the moon it took over a decade and

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,660
400,000 people to actually get that job

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,239
done the reality is that in both cases

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,910
there was a vast organization of

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,780
different disciplines involved included

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,850
engineers scientists mathematicians

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,260
project managers manufacturers and a

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,350
variety of other folks to get the job

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,209
done and my own experience then it's

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,070
when I started with Circuit City the

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,170
first thing that we did is we worked on

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,390
creating our annual marketing plan and

00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,769
really this was about ensuring that we

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,090
have the right bribe periods in place

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,220
based on what had happened in the past

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,410
like back to school and Christmas and so

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,180
on but in order to do this effort there

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,069
were about 40 to 50 people involved in

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,530
the project from a variety of different

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:12,450
roles ad buyers marketing specialists

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,389
data analysts business analysts

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,590
statisticians and project managers

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:17,820
without that diverse set of roles we

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,820
simply would not been able to get the

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,650
job done in addition to the breadth and

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,419
scope of the surprise problems there's

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,970
also simply the speed at these problems

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,560
continued to progress

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,060
if you look back over the last couple

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,160
decades you can see the landscape is

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,370
dotted with things such as with

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,250
companies such as blockbuster

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,750
myspace.com and RadioShack these are

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,480
organizations that simply miss the

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,250
opportunity to evolve or they simply

00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,770
cannot change fast enough to keep up

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,480
with the pace of change the folks that

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,370
are in this room are the best position

00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,500
in their organizations to highlight the

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,770
challenges the decision-makers face in

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,410
to provide a light on what those

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,850
headwinds actually looked like the

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,050
important thing though is that we have

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,300
to make sure that we have the right

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,550
people process and tools in place in

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,100
order to get this job done and do it at

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,420
the pace of change that's required with

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,920
that said you really need to make sure

00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,070
that you have the right foundation

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,020
underneath so I'm going to start with

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,280
people and talk about what you need

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,170
there now

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,300
in a lot of cases maybe simply enough to

00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,640
have a data scientist you know if you're

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,230
a citizen data scientist or you're just

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,970
doing a one-off type thing it may be

00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,640
enough to just have a data scientist on

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,990
the team but the reality is that some of

00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,850
the operational complexity around

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,910
putting these things in place at scale

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,500
really require a data engineer and this

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,630
an even though data scientist may be

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,490
capable of doing things that are that a

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,320
data engineer would do the fact of the

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,210
matter is that the dejan engineers are

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,220
really a specialization of software

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,020
engineering and the focus is really on

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,700
distributed systems and ensuring that we

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,530
can move data as quickly as possible

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,060
store data in such a way that it can be

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,800
leveraged again and again and then

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,140
ensuring that models that are produced

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,669
or operate can be done in an operational

00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,760
impactful and resilient way

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:03,230
in short data scientists focus on

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,820
delivering insights that can drive

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,100
business strategy in the real world and

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,870
EDA engineers should focus on making it

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,540
easy to go from the insight to action in

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,710
the real realm so I'm very quickly going

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,669
to take a step back and talk about a

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,560
mental model here

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,480
I really love Maslow's hierarchy of

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,950
needs I think it can be applied to a lot

00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,800
of different situations and really the

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,020
the basics about it is that you have to

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,190
have one layer of the pyramid taken care

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,500
of before you can really move on to the

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,690
next so for example you have to first

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,760
address physiological needs first like

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,190
food and sleep then you can move on and

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,720
worry about safety and then from there

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,729
you can move on and worry about things

00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,260
like love and belonging but if you don't

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:39,889
have your foundation in place you simply

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,400
cannot move

00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:44,749
the next layer so last year Monaco

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,400
regatta published a wonderful medium

00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:48,110
post on the data science hierarchy of

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,029
needs that follows a similar approach

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,830
and in this case there's really five

00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:54,050
steps the first is that you need to

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,659
collect the data second move and store

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,189
then explore and transform then

00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,659
aggregate and label and finally learn

00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:02,029
and optimize and create some type of

00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:03,409
output that can actually be used and the

00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,449
rules that I just mentioned earlier are

00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:06,919
involved throughout this process a data

00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:08,210
engineer really needs to be there to

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,099
ensure the right instrumentation is in

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,020
place the right framework assembly in

00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:14,270
place to move the data quickly and store

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,439
it efficiently together a data scientist

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,270
and data engineers can then work

00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,590
together to ensure that the data is

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,479
refined from the raw material into

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,969
something that can be used and finally

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,770
data scientists can also then take that

00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:27,650
data and then build the data models that

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,569
are required but with that you also need

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,430
to ensure that you have a data engineer

00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:33,259
involved so that they can productionize

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,060
that model in such a way that it can be

00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,680
operational impactful in large

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,199
organizations when you're dealing with

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,629
complex problems as well so together

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,430
they really build the foundation and

00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:46,129
then you see that this foundation is in

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,289
place as well so from a different

00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:50,300
perspective problems tend to be solved

00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:54,099
by our stay in our pattern with the

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,689
steps being ideation explore analyze

00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,639
synthesize in other words taking the

00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:01,039
results and putting something together

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,330
that can be shared out taking action on

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,800
those results and then deploying

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,689
something out there in the moral world

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,569
that can be operational impactful to

00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:10,009
your organization the problem is is that

00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:11,930
the duties are too often segregated

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:13,669
between the different portions of the

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,919
data organization where do you talk

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,020
about data scientists data engineering

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,550
or data management or any other of the

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,039
data professionals that are out there

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,349
and the key thing is that data

00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,580
scientists in data engineers as well as

00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:27,500
these other data professionals work

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,409
together throughout this process in

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,750
order to really get the job done with

00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,099
that said it's also important to ensure

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,289
that you have the right tools in place

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,260
so that you can collaborate together as

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:41,229
a team and as an organization in order

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,729
to really face these challenges down

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,649
data engineers should not only source

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,589
data but they should also build the

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,630
tools that enable others to do their

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:52,339
work as effectively as possible whether

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,600
it be a data scientist or it be somebody

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,220
that's less technical

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,350
but still needs to be involved in the

00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,889
iteration of an analysis or data

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,509
modeling work Jupiter can be the focal

00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:05,060
in which this entire process can be

00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:06,589
managed the use of extensions and magics

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,759
have always been there and the Jupiter

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,759
universe and I've always worked really

00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,620
well but the great thing is with Jupiter

00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,779
lab these extensions in become it can

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,160
become even richer and rubric lab can

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:18,560
serve as a medic container that can

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,300
manage a dis entire process except for

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,220
perhaps the last process but you can

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,680
still add in some data integrations as

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,240
well so let me kind of walk through what

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,699
types of things that you may be able to

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,500
do across this process within Jupiter

00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:32,079
the help of folks within your

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,720
organization to do things more easily

00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:37,819
first of all in order and id8 you could

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,490
organize your ideas in Jupiter for

00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:42,019
example something like a pocket or heap

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,420
where you can store everything that

00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,620
you've researched and looked into so the

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,449
team can collaborate together on those

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,209
ideas you could also integrate with your

00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:51,560
task management system such as JIRA so

00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:53,240
that the team knows what they're doing

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,860
next and can continue to collaborate

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,920
together even if they're not right there

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,110
together at one location additionally an

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,639
explorer you could integrate a data

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,430
source browser similar what you might

00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,380
see and a typical sequel editor into

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,660
Jupiter itself and connect it with your

00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,220
metadata catalog that fuzz ensuring that

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,339
people understand what data is available

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,850
and also enabling them to understand

00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:18,589
that data more more quickly and analyze

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,850
you could build data source connections

00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,069
that are standard across your data

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,899
system instead of writing a bunch of

00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:26,029
boilerplate code every time you need to

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,069
connect to any data source why not make

00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:30,319
it a one-liner or even simpler than that

00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:32,060
and just making a magic cell and that

00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:33,470
way it's incredibly easier for folks in

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,939
your organization to actually connect

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,949
with the data that they need to use on a

00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:38,569
regular basis in addition you could

00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:40,670
build common tooling like validation

00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:42,230
libraries for example that ensure that

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,529
the team does things in a standard way

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,970
across the entire analytic lifecycle and

00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:49,880
synthesize you could use things like

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,649
rise or lightning and plotly to ensure

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,689
that your decision makers and the rest

00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,180
of the team has a way to collaborate on

00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:57,769
the final results and really this may be

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,019
something that becomes an iteration as

00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:02,779
you move to action something like Airbnb

00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:04,189
is not a repo is an excellent example of

00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:06,410
a way that you can collaborate the

00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:07,310
Jupiter notebooks and then people that

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,660
are not actually do

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,720
working on the notebooks can then

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,130
collaborate write comments and then you

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,330
could have more of an open community

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,050
around the analysis that's being

00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:20,570
conducted and finally deploy you can

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,279
integrate with things like envy dime for

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,200
example that allows you to do disks on

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,330
github so that you can merger could you

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,339
here notebooks into github or use

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,650
something like Jenkins and Travis CI as

00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:33,770
it continuous and continuous integration

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,900
and delivery pipeline I think this last

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,730
step is absolutely critical to any

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,920
process that you have once the problem

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,660
gets to a complex enough stage the

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,010
reality is is that you need to be able

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,290
to move things that you've produced

00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,150
inter production quickly and as you

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,220
refine your analyses and you build along

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,480
the model you need to ensure that you

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,460
can move things into production as

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,440
quickly as possible so that they can be

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,170
as impactful an organization as quickly

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,850
as possible so anytime that my team

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,710
starts sending a project this is the

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,360
first thing that we do because we need

00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,790
to make sure that as the organization

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,510
asks us to change we can change as

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,850
quickly as we need to with that I like

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,339
to leave you with three conclusions the

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,830
first is that complex problems cannot be

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,990
solved by data scientists data engineers

00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,180
or any data other data professionals

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,490
alone we need to work together as

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,830
cross-functional teams and today's world

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,240
with the complex problems we face and by

00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,620
doing that we will be able to solve

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,290
these problems much more effectively

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,240
than we otherwise will be able to second

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,950
data scientists and data engineers

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,420
together ensure that you have that

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,760
success because then you have the right

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,670
skills in place in order to execute on

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,370
this entire process and finally Jupiter

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:45,980
can be a hub for well-managed agile

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,560
analytics and I would emphasize that the

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,020
fact is is that by ensure embedding what

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,400
you're doing within the tools themselves

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,630
you can ensure that your organization

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,980
and the team that you're working on is

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,160
doing things in a standard way

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,020
Fuzz ensuring you're well governed and

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,690
also allowing you to be agile in the way

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,060
that you do your agile your analytics so

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,709
with that said I would encourage you to

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,480
go back to your organization's and

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,370
really think about how can you organize

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,770
around these problems and the most

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,260
effective way possible if you're an

00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,540
individual seek out community with the

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,980
Jupiter open-source project or look for

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,020
other opportunities in the data science

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,880
community to provide your skills what

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,160
your data scientists data engineer

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,230
traditional data analysts or some other

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,030
kind of data professional with the

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,850
intersection of data engineering and

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,440
data science and Jupiter as your Swiss

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,620
Army knife in the data analytics world

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,170
any complex problem that you face can

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,920
and will be solved thank you and have a

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,980
wonderful day

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,980
