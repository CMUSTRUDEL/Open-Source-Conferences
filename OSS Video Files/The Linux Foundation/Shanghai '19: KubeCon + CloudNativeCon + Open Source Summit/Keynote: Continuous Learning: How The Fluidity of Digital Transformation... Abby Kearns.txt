Nihao thank you and done just kidding

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:14,370
we're getting near the end of the

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,100
morning and our pig gave me such a

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,869
fantastic introduction but the idea is

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,840
to talk a lot about how all of these

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:29,039
things work together in your day to day

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:31,769
lives this is a caterpillar and you may

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,960
be asking yourself why is a bee showing

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,750
me a picture of a caterpillar at an

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,750
open-source conference well a

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,020
caterpillar represents to me something

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,550
we all spend a lot of time talking about

00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:51,149
digital transformation because a

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,760
caterpillar spins a cocoon disappears

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,309
for a few weeks and emerges later

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,309
transformed it's magic right

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:06,780
but now something completely different

00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:09,150
this is a whitewater kayaker she's

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:15,900
navigating the rapids always alert

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:19,200
always in motion the waters around her

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,460
constantly shifting changing she must

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:29,490
react to their forces in the moment one

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:34,710
moment at a time now let's talk about

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:36,210
your organization how are you reacting

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,960
to the changes that are happening in

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,600
your markets

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,820
how are you reacting to the changes in

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,280
your industry are you able to be

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,560
responsive to customer needs are you

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,829
able to innovate and iterate at the pace

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,600
you want to because if you listen to all

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,509
the conversation that happens around

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,880
digital transformation it really focuses

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,770
on the fact that we're going to all

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,469
disappear for a few months and emerge

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,630
transformed we're going to have all the

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,799
skills we need to take advantage of all

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,229
these new technologies but we all know

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,960
those of us that live this day-to-day

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:16,410
it's not that

00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:19,270
simple real transformation is not about

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,190
adopting the latest technology it's

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,970
about adapting to a world that's now

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,890
ordered around technology we must

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,890
realize that the next new and shiny

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,530
thing is actually a river rapid of new

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:38,050
and shiny things and it's not slowing

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:40,870
down the reality is we're all kayakers

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,540
now if you understand where this analogy

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,310
was going but we're all trying to figure

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,680
out how to navigate all of these new

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:51,100
emerging technologies that are bubbling

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,290
up and how do we shift and change to

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,810
evolve to either adopt those new

00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:00,640
technologies or adapt to new ways of

00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:02,640
working and so what I think about what

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,630
this means for organizations

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,640
individually it's that we must have a

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:12,060
plan for learning the having choice for

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:16,330
those technology solutions is critical

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,880
and most importantly abstracting away

00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,380
that complexity so we spend a lot of

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,990
time this morning learning about a

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,480
variety of open source technologies and

00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:28,090
how they're all building blocks that

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,940
build the ultimate outcome which is that

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:37,090
solution for your business and so

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:42,820
abstraction is key so whether you're a

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:45,580
CIO a CEO a developer you're having to

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:49,450
look at horizons further ahead than

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:52,780
right now you're having to look further

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,730
ahead than the next new shiny technology

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,260
but more importantly how do all of these

00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,260
technologies work for your business

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,480
because the pace of change is

00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:12,120
accelerating everything is accelerating

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:14,650
in fact I believe that this year

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,960
organizations are now having to really

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,120
reconcile with the fact that all of

00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:23,620
these new technologies and the what

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,520
the value they bring to my business in

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,650
fact 69% of all IT decision makers

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,510
around the world say the digital

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:35,110
transformation is extremely or very

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,570
important to their business and so this

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,940
isn't just one or two companies that are

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,560
jumping on the latest hype it's

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,000
companies that are reconciling with the

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,000
fact that this is a new way of working

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,880
but what do I mean when I talk about

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,800
digital transformation because it's

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,430
let's be honest it's a word that's used

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,410
a lot but when I think about the core

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,919
tenants of digital transformation I

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:05,949
really come to three things the ability

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:10,060
to be more responsive to customers and

00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:14,229
changes in market demands the ability to

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:17,889
fail faster and finally the ability to

00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:20,289
innovate more and iterate on those ideas

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,850
quickly so when I think about digital

00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,700
transformation and the role technology

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:31,030
plays in those that's where I really

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:32,560
come back to one of the things we spend

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,880
a lot of time thinking about at Cloud

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,260
Foundry is what does the future look

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,930
like are we evolving fast enough are we

00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:45,430
adapting fast enough and what do our

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,930
users really want out of a platform we

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,360
came to the conclusion that our users

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:54,000
are looking at the ability to adapt to

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,470
change faster embrace multi-platform

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,370
really leverage a variety of

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,410
technologies to build their business and

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,210
finally why we're all here they want to

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,729
be part of open source they want to

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:11,320
leverage the open source technologies to

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:13,210
build the future of their business for

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,270
us this is represented a myriad of

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,460
changes over the years we're nearly a

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,260
five year old open source foundation and

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:25,810
for us we've had a long history of both

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,980
not just open sourcing our technologies

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,080
but pulling in and adopting a new

00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,170
latest emerging cloud native

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,630
technologies and for us I think about

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,700
the work we do here at Cloud Foundry

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,890
very similar to the adoption and

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:46,980
adaptation roles that you have to

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:50,250
undergo in your organizations from our

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,410
research we found that over 48 percent

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,320
of organizations today are already

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,150
running multi-platform that means these

00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,630
organizations are running platform

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,550
as-a-service containers server lists and

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,160
a variety of other technologies to solve

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:11,160
a myriad of complex businesses that they

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:14,370
have organizations today are also

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,530
running multi cloud so half of

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:22,380
organizations today are running across a

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:27,660
variety of public and private clouds we

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:30,750
also heard from our research that 66% of

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,750
people feel that open-source unlocks

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,490
opportunity and I wanted to highlight

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,290
that because that's been a big theme of

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,030
all of the talks this morning is how

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,580
open-source can not only help you

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,070
innovate faster but it unlocks the

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,940
opportunity in your business to innovate

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:50,700
a little further and go a little more

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,860
and for us at Cloud Foundry that

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,900
represents the same thing how do we

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,060
continuously evolve a platform as a

00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,060
service how do we make it the best

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:03,360
platform for developers and that's

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,340
looking at the open source world what is

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,920
happening in open source technology and

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,200
cloud native open source technology that

00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,460
are really going to help drive us

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,780
forward in fact one of our big

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,420
announcements from this year was the

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,310
Rini project and for those of you that

00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,280
aren't familiar with it the arena

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,840
project allows for a pluggable scheduler

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,620
within cloud foundry

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,050
so today now you can use Diego or

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,810
kubernetes to run and orchestrate your

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,790
containers this has been a project we've

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,360
been working on for some time but

00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:40,829
represents a big change in the way that

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,989
the cloud foundry

00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:47,819
the Cloud Foundry platform is evolving

00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:49,350
going forward for us we continue to

00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,809
think about all of the open source

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,509
technologies as they come up what are

00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:56,249
the role they play within our platform

00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:58,799
what's the value they bring to our users

00:08:56,249 --> 00:09:00,179
and that's a similar conversation I

00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:06,389
suspect you're all having in your

00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:08,730
organization's today as well for us we

00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:11,239
rely a hundred percent on our community

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,429
to drive this through pull requests

00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:16,679
commits our contributor base continues

00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:20,459
to power what the future of Cloud

00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:22,679
Foundry looks like and with half the

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:25,129
fortune 500 already shape in the future

00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:29,269
of their companies on cloud boundaries

00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:33,839
that is more important than ever

00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:36,600
companies like sky a uk-based telecom

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,199
company that leverages Cloud Foundry to

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,569
power their mobile services today run

00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:49,399
over 4,000 application containers on

00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:53,850
Cloud Foundry or another company s ap a

00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:55,829
large software company that uses cloud

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,709
foundry both internally as well as with

00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:01,589
their customers and has one of our

00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:05,069
larger deployments internally supports

00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:07,040
over 20,000 developers and runs 50

00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:10,379
thousand containers internally and

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,949
another 44,000 containers for their

00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:16,589
customers so we look at these two use

00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:17,850
cases as a way to think about how am i

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,949
pulling in these open source

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:26,220
technologies to build the future of my

00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:32,280
company so if I want to leave you here

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:34,260
today with two thoughts first

00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,480
is you're thinking about these new

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,830
emerging technologies and you're

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,310
thinking about building the future of

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,900
your company how can you participate how

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,670
can you leverage open-source to build
