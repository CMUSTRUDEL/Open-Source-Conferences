Playlist: Shanghai '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit
Description: 
	Enable Serverless Metrics in Apache OpenWhisk on Kubernetes with Prometheus - Ying Chun Guo, IBM 

Serverless functions are event-triggered, stateless and ephemeral, which makes metrics essential to a Serverless platform. Both system metrics and user metrics are helpful for operators and developers to understand what happens in the server side.     OpenWhisk is an open sourced Serverless/Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform that can be deployed on Kubernetes. Apache OpenWhisk uses Kamon to collect metrics by default. Kamon Prometheus exporter supports for exporting the metrics to Prometheus, which is the popular Kubernetes monitoring tool.    This presentation will introduce what kind of metrics are defined on Apache OpenWhisk, then show how to enable these metrics on Kubernetes using Prometheus and Grafana, and at last demonstrate a live demo.

I want to share with you how to enable

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,090
the various metrics in a patch-over

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:16,160
whisk on companies with Prometheus and

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,160
from IBM my name is going to

00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:26,730
'introduction first I've been working in

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:30,510
IBM for more than 10 years open source

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,980
developer so I've been working in open

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,469
source community for quite a long time

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:40,850
studying from OpenOffice to our

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:44,760
OpenStack then in 2016 I my focus

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:50,730
shifted it to assimilate I start with

00:00:44,760 --> 00:01:00,680
the unparished and now I was a working

00:00:50,730 --> 00:01:05,540
on Canadian and I'm also my presentation

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:09,960
let's talk about how we monitor risk I

00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:12,540
would start with a patch open risk of

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:18,360
you and I will explain the metrics

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:20,310
defined and how this metrics displayed

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,369
in Prometheus Prometheus

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,409
I was finished with the demo so

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,210
beginning to start with how many of you

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,210
have heard of us is quite a feel-good

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,900
computing cloud computing instructor

00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,429
invoker is

00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:50,409
down at the beginning we need to pay

00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:54,729
attention to the whole physical machine

00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:57,280
on Stan Virtual Machine the currencies

00:01:54,729 --> 00:02:06,069
are in continuous containers now the

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:10,690
focus is on the functions need to pay

00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:13,390
more attention underlying infrastructure

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,940
they can focus more on business

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:22,980
knowledge actual then the four cloud

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:22,980
vendors know they are computing speed

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:49,720
better resource organization functions

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:54,370
its daily event it is auto scale and

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:58,630
even scale to 0 that means occupy a new

00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:01,030
resource unless you equality in other

00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:10,049
words it isn't shot to live to you these

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:14,319
funds to reduce cost because is

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:15,880
generated by you years of usage so

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:23,829
without your stage of there won't be any

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:33,639
charge pay more attention to the warrior

00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:38,260
bow underlying infrastructure there's an

00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:42,239
image they can update easily or they can

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:45,099
put their idea into reality

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,250
so how do you make your own civilians

00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,700
fresh from the kubernetes is one of

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,190
platform

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:56,130
you I guess and in terms of kirino's

00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:00,390
orchestration it can be it's fair to say

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:05,160
that it is unique what all monopolies in

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:08,910
this organization then you can find it

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:15,240
open civilly oven stores civilians

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:18,300
project and deploy into their Rock quite

00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,010
a few projects open source or somebody

00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,070
it's pretty irani you that can be

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:32,550
deployed in communities for example open

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:38,550
whisk creative and Wobblies how mature

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:42,930
is to lower in their constant it is so a

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:45,750
pinch open which was initiated by IBM it

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,770
is an it is now an incubator in the

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:53,550
Apache community the aim is to build a

00:04:49,770 --> 00:05:05,940
open source function function Billy's

00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:09,930
birthday function is service when the

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:13,590
wizard is quite establish project in the

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:17,250
community because it has the appendix

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:21,120
where from foundation and it is proved

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:25,110
true before on the IBM cloud and some so

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:31,080
it is a quite a much work project in the

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:34,100
open encouraged event-driven programming

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:40,120
or event trigger and action

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:45,470
there is an important world active HD

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:48,830
and action which is no coding and you

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:57,650
can decoding support the common

00:05:48,830 --> 00:06:01,250
languages like Java pythons the apesh of

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:10,580
a whisk can be deployed on any talker

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:12,310
support to enhance your whisking can be

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,680
applied in kubernetes as well hopefully

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:18,500
we have a project through the helmet

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,020
then you can deploy the intervention

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,800
over whisk on kubernetes this is the

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,630
structure for the development a private

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,070
so you can see the chrome both modules

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:34,580
offer ok whisk on the left is the user

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:44,170
friend we can skip that followed by the

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:47,360
end X and X is an API give away the

00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:52,760
request into a controller labor G

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:56,810
control the controller send a requester

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:59,750
through balance in and the captain will

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:05,650
send it to involve the invoker will call

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:10,370
the container code and execute it

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:13,250
between controller and they focus Kafka

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:20,300
help with the communication which in the

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:26,240
to order data is saved in a coach DB on

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:28,599
the top you see also keeper it is

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,110
installed together with category

00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:34,990
based on this structure there are two

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:38,139
core modules in open ways one is control

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:41,139
of the attorneys and other than that's

00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:45,369
the Kafka and database these are also

00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:47,169
important which is amazing so this is

00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:53,309
that you become user cases in surveys

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:53,309
surveys in yourself is a micro service

00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:11,889
runs in the stateliest series equally

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,589
affordable is it southeastern my rest of

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:23,949
its platform you can improve a regular

00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:27,279
fine-grain into micro service api for

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:39,759
the in large number of events forty

00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:52,750
friends or functions can be great

00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:55,750
simulation can be used for measuring

00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:11,800
these metrics and it's very important on

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:14,800
young determine its own right yeah civil

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:19,709
is that means developers are far away

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,709
from infrastructure

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:33,190
the tolerance are not experienced MIT

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:33,190
workers painter want to write a code to

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:43,160
process so for this amateur developer is

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:49,130
they know they know something about

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:53,390
Python and they want to know after the

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:55,250
program is put on the cloud how the

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,930
program can run on the blouse they have

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:03,550
no idea they're for monitoring is very

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:06,530
important especially for civilization

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,510
metrics or telemetry that's the only way

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:18,590
for such developers to understand what

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:20,870
happens under server condition and it is

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,540
necessary any neighbor imagine ring and

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:27,800
the boy so muttering is reading in the

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:30,410
morning so how do we define the matrix

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,170
and the other ways open-face this thing

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:38,570
Russia's way to win system and the user

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:41,390
matrix typically contains information

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:50,150
about system performance rebellion in

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:53,540
the distant mattress come on and home

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:56,660
traces the metric bill usually use fight

00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:07,640
providers and operators another metric

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:11,240
is contains information about actions we

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,020
will use it as an event intended to lead

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,940
us

00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,020
so in a cop car you'll receive a lot of

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:22,130
the message and all things mostly a slow

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:24,800
action all right the information of the

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:29,000
absence said those apartments and it is

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,279
open and it can be used for towing or

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,980
audit purposes but we know those

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:39,770
situations you can use that via the user

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:44,560
interface and all this info can also be

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,560
used for the audit and filling as

00:11:51,670 --> 00:12:00,440
realizations in the open noise is

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:02,930
different so I think why did you choose

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,390
the comment to be the open source money

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,959
to rank fine word man oh and shopping

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:17,200
always is the right advice gamma and

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:17,200
gamma is based on the Java also use

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:29,180
face it's a KK which is that this really

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:31,370
communication in some way so what I

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:37,070
chose that's what can I use to collapse

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:40,899
the mattress and to record because we

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,899
thought that you have no clue is

00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:50,060
outstanding magic collection thing on

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:54,620
the JC and currently it has already go

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:57,140
to support so that's why we chose become

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,520
there are some features of the carbon

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,860
for example it does there really

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,420
probable matrix they can be distributed

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,930
triticum being able to you a mortgage

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,740
have been tracing on contact propagation

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,110
api is in the scandal

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,030
and also provide different my track

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:20,550
recording instruments it's a quarter

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:27,510
century later Beach the reporter we

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:29,310
don't need to change the and currently

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,220
how long is also here hoping and

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:36,450
optimize that well they were it can work

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:46,770
with some really popular horny - such as

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:49,860
the promise so I was right and when we

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:53,850
need to make metric and what kind of

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,010
magic plots and everything can be

00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,440
defined and done all these metrics baby

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,870
Latia by the common so let's have a look

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,430
at the common mattress instruments well

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,830
actually it provide different side of

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:07,290
the instrument breaks and you can count

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,570
how many times it was in a treatment

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:13,070
during every point when you really look

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:17,460
at for accounting every occurrence

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:21,150
without dividing is the gauge what she's

00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,860
into the matrix and track basic oh I

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,800
know that can be increased meant the

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,810
basement or as she was pleased with our

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,600
school moving floor opposed such as the

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:34,440
vegetable memory and the music and the

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,020
next one is the histogram track it is

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:41,400
young complicated in my training they

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:51,990
can track me interview given mattress

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:52,660
with a specific duty for the re so the

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,480
data

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,950
the queuing is all the number of the

00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,500
Kenosha people of the Shoei

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,510
it's changing from 1 to channel from 1

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,460
to 5 so Julie on this period what we

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:09,580
need we need Kellerman values what about

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:11,170
minimum with an historical record all

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,740
the data that's all the values between

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:17,400
people you also have the leaders in NATO

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:21,070
and it will be stored in it right

00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:23,760
very so if you are interested you have

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,110
made all this attention

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,420
well the next function is the time

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,750
Android allows you to again start and

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:35,920
stop the timer and a lot - the range so

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:39,130
these are these remains are used quite

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:46,890
often in the but we didn't use the last

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:53,130
time and open waste and ot2 control of

00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:53,130
our frame from the controller's

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:05,620
accusation we could clone the years ago

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,990
is called High Commission a broken

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,650
monitor the activations memory units

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:14,470
have a debate and HTTP status and where

00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,720
they are oh it's the mattress for now

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,060
yes and currently I always have you some

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,460
really typical it's bringing about 100g

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:26,230
when you sleep or the council

00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:30,090
activations and chill Kafka have had the

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:34,980
activation that is the sociable so you

00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:40,620
set your record faithfully can open on

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:44,170
activation started so the country is

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:51,340
another one is again we use the term

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:55,060
would be 0 to society controller to

00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,089
record number of these annotations euros

00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,980
being worked upon

00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:03,049
or they can even control and attend

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:07,669
tonight's eating healthy on society cool

00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:11,520
you got activation again don't amount

00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:18,329
everybody's use for the applications for

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:24,860
the histopath we use the aperitivo use

00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:24,860
it in Concord to manage the memory usage

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:38,669
from that division to record the numbers

00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:40,529
of the activations and after all this

00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:43,860
convenient tricks no let's look at her

00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:46,320
problem is it's only library so the

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,600
president is chosen as the matrix for

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,899
you after the matrix cracking the main

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:56,210
story somewhere else right and Patti we

00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:56,210
use this base name and currently

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:05,730
treating you free Prometheus it has an

00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:10,140
attorney is an insane theist project is

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:29,520
it and so this monitoring system it much

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:32,840
reason wrong so I think that Babbage

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:36,059
Grayson boat it has a greenhouse

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:42,840
theta are searching languages it's not

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:44,880
really live between orange and the time

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,980
series crashing happens over

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:54,380
although over HTTP in order to gather a

00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,380
monitoring data we can use the

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,729
[Music]

00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:58,549
the metric must be all the mantras also

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:03,889
use magnets the dangerous but the other

00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:07,009
is a short time task for about seven

00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:11,120
seconds the process quality you about

00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:13,190
ten seconds in this place you will face

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,169
a lot of dangers and that's why we have

00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:19,669
a two-way cameras all right you can be

00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:22,610
transferred and pool and that thing can

00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:27,049
be connected not just store it in memory

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:34,879
so we can use it to search hit on the

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:37,460
right-hand side which means that the

00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:40,490
alert will be sad I also have the web UI

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:45,470
now maybe I thought of thing hovering

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:48,409
available is the basic line in Moodle

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,870
besides that maybe one we can also use

00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:55,570
the label and a message to find all this

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:55,570
kind of the optimal conditions

00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:05,970
come on we developed like our competence

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:09,000
Accord which is an open source project

00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,190
the data is written you can load it's

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,960
the poorest the integration of the

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:19,140
commonality as long as you'll add a

00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,330
really simple statements mattress canal

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:31,350
my department will be converted to

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:32,400
promises for natural aging or expose do

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:40,770
with the ancient interpretation should

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:42,990
be addressed in this way this kind of

00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:45,360
magic can be concealed by the promised

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,520
use and you can ask them famous in the

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,010
promise which will it may both the

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,530
primacy of chemicals and it is from the

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,240
answers terminals so that's all this

00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,190
payment and that's we add to these

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,430
projects so they would look at this

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:03,060
diagram we take out which controller

00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:06,870
here currently we expose both the

00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:14,100
controller and in the controller we use

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:21,650
the government we are used from ego this

00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:21,650
morning to Christ

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:30,960
and when I use the the retriever

00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:33,000
butchers are more dangerous all these

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,650
are kids and this way the matter it can

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,630
be shows on the innovative there are

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,090
obvious - yes

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:42,270
and later I like to like to give you a

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:45,030
simple demo in the target you can see

00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:49,560
that the controller now the motors has

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:51,330
already got metrics respectively well

00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,720
now I'd like to give you a really simple

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,720
demo

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:03,990
well I'll sweeten the demo has already

00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:05,880
been installed properly and I mean that

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,550
the common and the Prometheus project

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,410
has already been installed so I just

00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,410
want to show you the result

00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:29,140
well Ashley this one is stored on the

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,140
cloud so maybe a little slow

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,360
yeah

00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:38,570
here it's God but they'd help too I just

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:41,179
hear mention are all the matrix the one

00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:44,410
started with the counter the seaman's

00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:47,420
encounter and gate means measurement

00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:50,860
here is the diagrams these are the

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,860
collector and matcher is collected

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:01,100
Activision this is monetary medic return

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:03,770
our understand it the the time for the

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,250
activate activation which is then the to

00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,250
the Kaka

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:21,100
wonderful counters basically it's a

00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:32,650
fabulous either a zero one two something

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:35,880
like that in any case how many topics

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,880
are studied

00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:05,450
the end of my presentation if your

00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:17,450
conditions

00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:19,629
risa raise your hand can use microphone

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,629
please

00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:33,010
one to write a function on fast

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,140
maybe this functional need to connect to

00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:43,720
the third party like objects and storage

00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:49,180
and then will you provide it's not and

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:51,550
also maybe unfunctional service please

00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:54,280
some if he years I've just started

00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:58,210
changing new researches you like to use

00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,360
cloud service to example use the rest

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:05,470
for in the eye if you can use the

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,880
third-party service and just use them

00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:11,440
some if that service is not available

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,890
and you can handle your code and that

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:19,480
would involve on a huge project so

00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:28,590
whatever I mean I use the emissivity

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:33,070
there will I be n for a white sounds are

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:36,580
integrated with them again so if you use

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,540
the use the service it's an IBM clouds

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,990
it's very convenient

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,990
thank you

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,980
so after listening to your presentations

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:56,040
over to my knowledge so you use the

00:27:52,980 --> 00:28:02,130
exporter to provide some metrics for

00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:04,230
monitoring for more Prometheus so for

00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,180
the image display and you have any

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:09,600
measures in any order in this regard in

00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:13,130
our community there's a developer here

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:20,360
all of the graph on our interface but

00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:20,360
not on Prometheus okay

00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:39,700
more question thank you I'm not

00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:43,390
Christian I've um some time we keep on

00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:46,300
woman you got along so well I mean

00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:49,270
provide some resolve tracing or

00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,820
monitoring yes what about our system

00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,940
unless it's no use also available thank

00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,940
