	Lightning Talk: 7 Tips for Tricks to Enjoy Your Kubernetes Journey - Daniele Polencic, Learnk8s Ltd 

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 â€“ April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

Getting started with Kubernetes and learning *all* about it can be tricky. But even if you're a seasoned engineer you might have had one of those "I wish I knew it before!" moments.  In this talk, you'll learn everything you need to know to get the most out of Kubernetes (and beyond).  From CI/CD to kubectl and security, this talk delivers actionable advice to improve your day-to-day workflow.

hi everyone thanks Vicki so today I'm

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,189
going to talk about seven tipping tricks

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,730
on how to make the most of your cube

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:14,179
next journey so the first one is take it

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,100
easy so you might have used other

00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:20,460
Orchestrator like measles or a Turkish

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,170
war but Cuba natives is just a little

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,510
more complicated of all of them right

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,060
and as soon as you start deploying you

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,000
realize that things aren't so easy

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,250
anymore but it's only when you move to

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,489
persistent storage and networking that

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,380
things are really really complicated and

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,989
they don't stop if you go to network

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,040
policies or for disruption budget so

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,870
it's hard so take your time and you know

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,100
you might not learn Cuban aids in three

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:53,399
hours or a weekend so be aware of it

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,260
tip number two is just pay attention to

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,390
your productivity when you use the

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,770
command line so we spend a lot of time

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:04,260
typing commands such as qPCR get pods so

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,710
it makes a lot of difference if you have

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,570
your command line optimized so that

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,060
doesn't mean just using spins such as

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,729
cube CTL auto-completion also means

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,710
using you know know what to search when

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,890
it comes to documentation so cube today

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,909
I'll explain or using tools to change

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,040
context and name space quickly using use

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,720
of crew to manage your plugins in cubes

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,930
ETL or like a terminal prompt like ups

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,020
one two just get in the current status

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,430
of the cluster at a glance a couple of

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,549
links if you're interested in this sort

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,470
of stuff on the screen number freeze

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,540
don't drop connections so you might be

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,189
aware that cuban natives when you do a

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,990
running upgrade it's going to create a

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:54,630
new pod and then switch that pod for all

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,549
your deployments so that deployment is

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,140
that that switching is based on

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,360
something called readiness and lightness

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,490
probes so cuba natives will wait for the

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,520
liveness and Reynes probe is voice which

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,170
is the new version now if you don't set

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,000
those rightness and lifeless probe what

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,099
happens these cuba days will not wait

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,020
for your application to start it will

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,660
actually just replace immediately

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,030
an excellent recipe to take down your

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,150
production infrastructure tips number

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,890
four is click and play so you might be

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,770
tempted to just use Google cloud

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,490
platform click on the UI select a couple

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,890
of options

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,590
couple of azs and create your own

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,260
cluster and then click on it and connect

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,390
you might do the same with vks or just

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,500
go in and console a couple of screens

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:43,980
and and create your cluster same vks as

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,970
well but if you do that you should be

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,520
aware that there are some challenges we

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,290
with doing so and mainly the challenges

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,570
around keeping the configuration in

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,730
seeing the time it takes to create those

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,770
configurations always the need to go and

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,450
click on stuff instead what you should

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,620
pay attention to is to just use

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,840
something like terraform so

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,460
infrastructure is code or bloomie where

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,110
you can have things like this where you

00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,180
script out the inside infrastructure and

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,230
then with a command you can just bring

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,540
it up number 5 is exposing services so

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,220
you might be familiar with services in

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,190
cuban ATS you can have multiple of them

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,870
and you have a sort of external load

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,550
balancer which is use the in which is

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,520
called the ingress and then you could

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:29,700
have several undresses the most famous

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,290
one is nginx what you can have as many

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,470
of you want so which one should you

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,360
choose well it depends right just paid

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,850
it you know pay attention and spend the

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,250
time as to like the right one number 6

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,000
is automate your governance so if you're

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,410
looking at violating your Yama files or

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,650
enforcing backs practices when it comes

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,260
to writing resources standardizing your

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,120
ya know or just in general being really

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,709
quick and getting feedback when your

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,310
yama isn't the way you want it to be

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:03,950
just use the open policy agent copper

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:06,900
cloudy suite 66 or an cube evolved from

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,730
instrumental they all designed to

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,690
basically look at your Yama and give you

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,670
feedback or reject resources the last

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,790
tip I've got for you last Eve of God for

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,620

lucky enough to be in Cuba and Barcelona

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,819
this year where I had the opportunity to

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,039
meet people that I usually only me

00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:29,500
online so to make the best of your Cuban

00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,879
energy journey my advice to you is enjoy

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,229
the wreckage in the next three days

00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:37,180
because it's going to be great that's

00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:40,060

much for listening to me I'm done I work

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,250

thank you very much

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,379
