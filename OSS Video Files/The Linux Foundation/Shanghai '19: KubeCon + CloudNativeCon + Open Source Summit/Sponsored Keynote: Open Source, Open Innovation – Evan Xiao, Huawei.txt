Description: 
	Sponsored Keynote: Open Source, Open Innovation – Evan Xiao, Vice President, Strategy and Business Development, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd 

As the optimum organizational form for open innovation, &nbsp;open source is the results of global full co-operation and participation. The essence of open source value is helping industry/end user to solve their problem, and we do believe open source could contribute more in more industries. Evan Xiao will share Huawei's practice and thoughts on this topic.

	00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,600
good morning good morning everyone

00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:12,860
welcome to China and welcome to Shanghai

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,860
I will make my speech in Chinese yeah

00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:29,130
[Applause]

00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:36,180
money I'm very glad to hear and meet all

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:39,390
of you and also any sense to NXT our way

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,510
is one of the earliest accompanies our

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:48,539
participation in the open source and the

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:52,129
open source is already our part ova pave

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:57,440
the strategic development and today i'm

00:00:52,129 --> 00:01:03,750
very glad to take this opportunity to

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:06,420
share with you our thinking on the

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:15,409
ecosystem on the open source and other

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:24,090
practices so for this is rough

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:27,930
this is 500 or 600 BC it is the ancient

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,390
apartment covers and this is maybe the

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,020
first time recorded in the human history

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,650
of the global corporation and the center

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:42,720
of the years later the open source is

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:45,600
down promoting the larger scale and more

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:53,970
innovative and more open global

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:58,860
cooperation so I totally agree with Jim

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,049
sharing the open source belongs to the

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,500
world

00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:08,869
and it should not be impacted by various

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:11,989
by politics and today we hear some other

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:15,319
noises in the world and there are more

00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:18,230
unexpected sees so many sensors to Linux

00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,620
a foundation for still keeping the open

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,019
source a spirit and this is a great

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:31,120
sense of responsibility Thank You Linux

00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:36,319
Foundation and probably believe that the

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:40,400
essence of open source instead to divert

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,829
solve problems and create values in

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,049
actively participating the open source

00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:49,190
community development we are also

00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:52,430
working very hard for the bringing the

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,760
open source achievements to of a client

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:59,269
and their self issues for them and to

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,920
create and producer values of open

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:05,750
source in the digital industry

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,410
transformation background there are more

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:12,680
opportunities for the open source and we

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:16,100
are also very glad to be together with

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,769
the developers and our partners in the

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:23,090
industry as well as our clients to

00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:25,940
actively explore how to release a more

00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:30,769
value over open source in a wider range

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:35,269
and then think the IOT scenario with all

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:38,120
that IOT is a very popular but it at the

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:41,000
same time is facing some issues the

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,940
lighter fragmented resources like the

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,910
technology are not balanced and the

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:51,440
end-to-end integration is not easy in

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:54,799
the IOT the IOT and offices can help the

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,620
upstream and downstream to quickly form

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,129
a ecosystem which is our open

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,340
like China Unicom

00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:06,500
they work together with the modules were

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,840
under chips a leading company based

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:14,599
around a lie to us like OS which is the

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,880
like assert operating system to be the

00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,709
foundation of the technology and appeal

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,190
to the standard for the industry and

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:28,669
then accelerate the commercialization

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:30,800
over the projects and now the successful

00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,770
projects that is happened in the water

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,250
treatment the firefighting the logistics

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:42,800
and also the industries or management

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:46,010
and for the edging business we also see

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,770
it is difficult to do the deployment and

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:53,150
the coordination between the edge and

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:56,479
the cloud is England and is not smooth

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:59,720
enough surveys found a partly to the

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:03,500
edge computing and open source based on

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,940
our thirst abilities we cube edge we

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:11,930
hope to have the containerized edge

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:14,660
computing to be further developed and to

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,639
have to analyze the standard for the

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:21,110
edge computing and the solve the issues

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,510
of folder edge and the IOT users now

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,630
means the open world open source or

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:29,360
projector is also used in the industrial

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,810
zone in the coal mine and in the smart

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,810
campus

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,010
and also this is the photo compiler in

00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,350
the past five years we spent our five

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:47,350
years or for the Noah confront the

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:51,210
compiler development it can improve the

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:55,090
terminal performance including the

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:58,630
smoothness over the operation fluency

00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,640
which is 24% increase and system

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,520
response performance with an increase of

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,180
44% under the application operation

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,790
fluency with an increase of 60% so how

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,720
to quickly and more effectively to have

00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:16,960
the users to enjoy these achievements

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:21,280
within a third open source is at the

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,820
best choice my way has confirmed later

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,780
in August of this year we will have

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:31,810
officially open source of a compiler and

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,730
we also worked with the top smartphones

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,360
and the third parties applications

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:42,060
developers and listen to them and we

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:47,200
also hope that our partners can come to

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:54,970
this platform and we work together to

00:06:47,200 --> 00:07:00,010
build our North on the terminal the open

00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:04,180
source is already a driving force for

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:07,450
the open innovation a nebari is more

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,090
than happy to work with the open source

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,800
communities and actively participate

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,220
together with the developers their

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:21,010
industry partners and other clients to

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:23,800
raise the issues and bring the issues

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,290
raised by the industry and the client

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,900
and work together with other developers

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,190
we hope to be very gentle enough for the

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,880
innovation and together with other

00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:38,800
developers to build a fair a open and

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:40,390
healthy and owing globalized ecosystem

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,450
thank you very much

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,450
