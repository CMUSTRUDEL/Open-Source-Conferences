	7 Missing Factors for Your Production-Quality 12-Factor Apps - Michael Elder & Shikha Srivastava, IBM 

We've all heard of and practiced the 12-factor principles for effective microservices. With Kubernetes, many of these factors are directly supported. In this talk, we ask the question: are the 12 factors sufficient for building production-quality, scalable, and secure microservices?  Based on our experience creating enterprise-grade production-ready apps based on Kubernetes, we identified 7 missing factors that are often overlooked. These additional factors ensure that you can upgrade, secure, and scale your apps all the way to production. We'll describe these 7 factors and provide specific guidance on how to adopt them in the delivery of your next Kubernetes microservice.
