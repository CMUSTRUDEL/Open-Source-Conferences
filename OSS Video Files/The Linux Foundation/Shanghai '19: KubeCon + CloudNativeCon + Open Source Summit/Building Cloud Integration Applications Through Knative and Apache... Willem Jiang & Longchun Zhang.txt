Description: 
	Building Cloud Integration Applications Through Knative and Apache Camel - Willem Jiang & Longchun Zhang, Huawei 

Apache Camel provides a powerful EIP (Enterprise Integration Patterns) DSL to integrate tons of different software middlewares. The project has been proven to be solid for years, while in the Cloud Native era, applications are powered by containers and Kubernetes. The Camel-K project builds features upon the serverless framework Knative, by leveraging Knative eventing and serving components, it brings Apache Camel into the Cloud Native world. With Camel-K, developers can integrate Knative applications with few lines of DSL codes, to glue services together.    In this talk, Willem and Longchun will briefly introduce Apache Camel and Camel-K project, and how they are integrated with Cloud Native stacks. At the end they will give an end-to-end demo on how the services are integrated with Camel and Knative, which is from the practices in a smart park project.

okay nice tonic good afternoon

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:12,660
let's start our presentation you didn't

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:17,299
cloud integrative application houki

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,299
native and we're Apache chemically I

00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:29,970
like to give you some introduction my

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,430
name is Bob William Neal jump I'm from

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:38,969
the of asteroid standard of the far way

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:40,590
I can involve independent Apache project

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,960
for a long time

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,100
well actually I've been in this area for

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,620
a long time so I am the Apache member

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,840
before I joined a while I was in moving

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,460
the apache camel departments but

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,780
currently there are a lot of new things

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,030
in there and that's why that i also

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,010
involved a lot of the invested a lot of

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,650
time in their parenting program and

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,330
today i will like to share with you a

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:21,060
lot about apache and become okay i'm

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:38,130
also i also involve in the actors in the

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:41,400
iPass and today difficulties the chinese

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,280
when we carry out we start small park

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,710
and how do we use the apache camel to

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:56,250
solve the problems between that a white

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:59,040
truly native to run a camera education

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,619
demo to go through the whole process so

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,759
this is the agenda of our education

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,480
today just that i just told you about in

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,040
a past

00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:15,630
I wasn't within the integration of the

00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,570
iPad enterprise clients for a moment so

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,830
this is how it looks in the small party

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:24,090
our machines in H Mart there is a

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:28,230
management system just like it when

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:31,470
Mouse and then we'll just scan our

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,840
Father and then go into the park it

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,700
looks really simple yeah but it's really

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,700
efficient as well but let's imagine that

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:49,260
all these new system the bowel system

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,380
and a car system can be integrated

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:57,210
together - Dai mother Rica's had any new

00:02:52,380 --> 00:03:00,330
applications but not in this market and

00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:03,630
we also mention something like scan your

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,310
face and then you can be authorized in

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,820
this way

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:12,150
and they are really simple system but we

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,570
can have the integration platform to

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:20,360
connect the camera details together and

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:23,520
then near the camera recommendations to

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,830
recognize the person and then in the

00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,030
beste system we can see that whether a

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,190
person tries to go through or not oh we

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,520
can also use these systems how the

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,670
customer survey study your VIP client

00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,739
has already become like the mantra of

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,250
the template system to tell them when to

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:51,630
open and close and actually BIA or Emacs

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:54,239
a lot because like that before and after

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,090
the camera just catch the faith of the

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,770
system the information or the message to

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:04,650
send to the integration app and then the

00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:07,320
face of the person in the retina it and

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,730
then in the best assistant and it will

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,849
be told that whether is an

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:17,790
even it is a real visitor whether it is

00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:21,030
a tried and won or not and then it will

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:24,030
tell the receptionist that well please

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:26,220
receive your VIPs from the Panaji and

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:37,110
then tell the truth out to open or to

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:39,300
stop so this is the solution and all

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,700
this kind of system can be combined to

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,110
the integration system or the platform

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:49,320
and form a new application which is

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:53,970
called integration path so how can we

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,370
achieve the integration and we don't

00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:02,220
have the to miss out so I'm going to

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:04,830
give you all the tools now it will be

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,860
replaced by this robot on this robot

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:11,160
there is a smooth camera we'll need to

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:14,430
catch my face my face info will be

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,150
uploaded to the integrate app and then

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:26,580
we'll have a system will have every

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:30,270
simple system it can be record our

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:36,900
vision is the VIP or not they also have

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:39,389
a mock system it will be connected as

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,690
well one it is connected one the be

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,729
happy or not VIP mystery stuff and I was

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,950
received the informations of the message

00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,660
via my mobile phone and they also have

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,810
the kill which will ask you some

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,960
instructions as well if we will rely to

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:58,080
open the tin sau the kill will be on and

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,169
then the tinsel will be opened so via

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,510
this integration apps we can convert all

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,250
the system together and generate a new

00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,439
application so this is what our

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,379
demonstration is about

00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:14,580
okay so mullet man please introduce us

00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:18,819
how can we achieve that attitude well

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,889
Michael Walker is my project manager you

00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,169
just assigned me a really interesting

00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,929
project so after I've received this

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,159
assignment how can we achieve that now I

00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:31,389
would like to give you a brief

00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:33,249
introduction of the integration that

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,889
well actually it is very simple which is

00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:39,009
combined vacation and application being

00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:41,679
together in order to find is to maybe

00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:43,689
these two applications cannot be

00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:47,050
communicate to each other we need to

00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:49,779
process some data in personally will be

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:52,719
the database to do that the application

00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:56,019
and will be access to the database and

00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:58,360
then they can commit to each other so

00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:01,599
necessarily always for the integration

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:06,849
but for the capital it is really

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:09,489
interesting and it would have a lot of

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:12,249
abstracts for example the abstract of

00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:14,829
the essay right in this way we can

00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:20,229
that's the out and appeal yes build

00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:22,659
process and data will do something later

00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:25,629
in our case and I will lab rate that in

00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:29,409
details and how can we achieve the

00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:31,449
integration of all the apps used in the

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:35,469
small park and currently we already have

00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:37,839
a cloud so whether we can use all these

00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:39,999
kind of scenarios in the car or not well

00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:44,039
actually you can find out the answers

00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:44,039
later when we introduce you the campaign

00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:51,039
topic first I'd like to introduce you

00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:53,169
the approach camera what is this and it

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,719
has already been amazing for over 12

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,849
years and I've been involved in these

00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:00,159
projects for more than eight or nine

00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:04,029
years from well actually not

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:06,219
continuously now for the camel it is

00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:08,000
really good for the integration because

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:13,450
thickness is free-school

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,450
in the past when we did the ESP mechapls

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:21,590
focused on the process of the message

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:29,930
and one as the router and it worked and

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:32,810
it is the Java based integration so it

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,969
is easy to run and later I'm going to

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:39,909
give you some concrete cases later as

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:41,210
well and it can also go to implicate the

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:44,000
EIP

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:48,710
which is the enterprise integration

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,380
pattern so that a being used in

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,930
scenarios ready to an equation so when

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:58,850
you device the apps a lot of the calls

00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:01,490
are repeated so if we can abstract these

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,630
kind of the repeating parts the lines of

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:08,210
the cows will be reused

00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:10,850
well Ashley currently you can tell that

00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:13,460
how many lines of the code I will write

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,710
can make these kind of the information

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,390
available well actually you can have

00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:21,050
your gas in your mind and later I will

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:23,930
tell you the freelancer for the camel it

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,800
is really active the community's really

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,000
active it provided over 300 component or

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,860
the chemical movements you can

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,910
understand them in this way for example

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:38,630
if I would like to integrate it to FTP

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:42,050
or the as a mass of the Amazon if we

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:46,760
need communicated with all this kind of

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:49,670
communication platform components can be

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,270
used as well and Ashley in a camel it

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:56,480
has less than two and four components

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,880
but it has mobile 300 components for

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,490
maintenance so if you have to remember

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,580
requirements for the application your

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:07,640
requirement can be mad because as you

00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,010
can use some moment vanilla

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,920
and actually this is one of the reason

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:17,660
for me to use the camel to make this

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:20,320
integration act just now my Kinetico

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,760
cloud camo has been working on

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,990
integration for a decade more than 10

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:29,740
years it is a very powerful tool and we

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:33,550
have these elements of romance novels

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:38,000
this ramallah race works on different

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,900
integration of it is powered by a patch

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,700
camo

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:50,510
the core is a camo and we it has four

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:55,400
features called a PCB is application to

00:10:50,510 --> 00:11:00,310
application that means the integration

00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:03,770
on the cloud and of the cloud B means

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:09,710
around the integration of our app

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:14,240
windows colors sea winds clouds I have

00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:17,780
this we know that a cloud private cloud

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,370
public cloud and there are many vendors

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:26,470
for public clouds so so CDM means the

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:30,170
cloud integration & Demons device like

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,120
device and I would IT how they can be

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,360
interpreted so the Roma integration

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:40,040
platform works on these four aspects or

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:44,390
the four scenarios there is no much no

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:48,110
many codes required bible's pulling them

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:59,070
then these four ABCD can be combined or

00:11:48,110 --> 00:12:04,380
interpreted explain that

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:13,079
portico it has days of integration

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:16,139
pattern programming interface of users

00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:20,430
it is realized by this integration

00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:27,470
pattern here here you can see there are

00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:27,470
about 15 years Moto's through this moto

00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:40,139
issuing this common the common issue is

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:43,459
in these scenarios can be adjusted there

00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:48,120
are some core modules one is related to

00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:51,120
information messaging messaging like

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:57,870
message of construction example in terms

00:12:51,120 --> 00:13:01,310
of measuring there may be some message

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:04,769
may be deployed in different places to

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:07,079
enhance the messaging efficiency second

00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:13,470
is a messaging consumption like through

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:17,040
polling from database that is monitoring

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:19,760
STP like if there is message for my

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:26,490
point and point we can respond to that

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:30,600
in a four message there is multicast or

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,430
aggregated approaching example when you

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,720
receive a message or may need to notify

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:40,920
an ABC the three subsystems and this ABC

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:45,449
assistance will respond to you and you

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,970
need to handle their responses and

00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:52,889
accurately replicate these responses and

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:55,560
in this case the IP has much more models

00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:59,610
to deal with that and the camo is a

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:05,740
specific reality or realization on the

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:09,670
IP you can choose Chris many DSL

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:15,010
I will give you specific samples this is

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:17,010
an a commodious example this looks like

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:20,800
Lego

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:23,380
so the EIP is the standard components of

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,570
Lego when we do the integration we use

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,750
these standard components and put them

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:33,910
together then we have this integration

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:37,150
or so it yeah Lego game is a good

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:40,770
metaphor when you build a Lego like

00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:43,630
aircraft model you use different

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,790
components what we do is to say we

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,910
develop this base a cub center the

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:51,100
models or components and you can put

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,900
together these components and make your

00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,610
own model now I give you a specific

00:14:52,900 --> 00:15:08,110
example here this is a kind of based

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:10,840
content based around doctor after

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:14,080
certain conditions is met the message

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,760
can be routed into not a and if

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,250
conditions could immerse then the

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,250
message can be routed to not be

00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:33,989
it's a similar to the regular codes

00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:36,269
writing here first we have a from like

00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:40,829
the starting point of studying point

00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:44,819
note we get the message this is a sort

00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:48,869
of message and we'll make a judgment

00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:51,419
whether it is a bug or not and this bug

00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:55,589
and this message is routed to another

00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:58,350
coup and a way we write a memo

00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:01,649
application we don't need to use message

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:07,139
queue we can use other things like a

00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:12,449
direct endpoint or seda and point to do

00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:24,660
the job in this way the message curl

00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:30,079
won't be required from the job ideas out

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,079
and it also supports other languages

00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:41,579
this is the esmad idea cell and if you

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:42,839
have used abs you will notice that you

00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:47,089
don't need to write a lot of your code

00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:59,819
you just start the first step then the

00:16:47,089 --> 00:17:02,299
SM ever can load it the roof take AIT an

00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,299
example

00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,779
[Music]

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:17,029
first we will have a component or not

00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:20,870
this not let's say like camera it will

00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:23,230
capture the information I know it is

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:29,200
edge it has these a facial recognition

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:32,840
function then through this

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,590
transformation will transform these that

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:39,139
are into that are recognizable by the

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,960
visitor visitors instead then it will be

00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:44,720
transferred into VIP component then it

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,730
can we can send this to the visitor

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,960
system and the visitor system will

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,350
respond to it

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,080
and gives you back and that will evolve

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,590
for judgment we will need to make a

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,929
judge we need to charge whether it is

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:03,019
allowed or not and if it is allowed

00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:05,299
whether it is a VIP or non VIP then this

00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:07,940
information will be sent back to remove

00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:13,159
the notification system on the right top

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:19,700
right and this component is transferred

00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:22,070
into a cosmos into data format that is

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,730
recognized will recognize them by this

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,730
Cosmo

00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:36,769
it is beautify these seven blocks these

00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:43,119
seven blocks are the core modules in

00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:47,600
these cameras so this is the concept

00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:52,190
hold a structure now we can see take a

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:55,009
look at the specific code basically if

00:18:52,190 --> 00:19:03,639
involves like 20 codes and I think we

00:18:55,009 --> 00:19:03,639
can reduce do some codes like a hetero

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:14,920
and all the codes are published pick up

00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:18,640
and you can download it so the first two

00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:25,870
lines it is flaming about the restful

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:37,059
endpoint then Cosmo can communicate with

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:39,700
the routers there's a service call that

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:42,750
mean that would be our visitor system

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:47,040
the visitor system will check in

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:49,570
visitors and we will get the information

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:54,130
from the visitor system because we use

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:56,370
these years Jason pans to to process the

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,320
data and we can get the visitors name

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:06,940
then the information will be transmitted

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:11,710
to next not regarding for notification

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:16,600
service it's also easy we add one to

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:18,850
yourself this data will make judgment

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,030
will charge the name of the visitor and

00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:31,059
if the advisor is X then we will add VIP

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:34,210
to in front of it and with this VI he

00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:37,450
had VIP error and then this information

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:40,740
can be transmitted to the next level

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,740
that's the C service

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:52,970
and the notification will be sent back

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:57,040
to the cosmos basically it's a it's a

00:20:52,970 --> 00:21:00,290
link or glue that connects three systems

00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:07,640
so the endpoint can have communication

00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:12,080
with remote services so there are only

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:15,680
20 lines of code does it mean that I

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:19,160
after I finish these 20 lines then it

00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:24,020
can run or not actually is to involve

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:29,870
other words we need to generate relevant

00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:31,820
files you can go to the github to check

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:35,480
the information in the interest of time

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:41,030
I will skip that later on I will run a

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:46,880
demo we also need to define camo and

00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:53,080
component if we want to run it on when

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:58,160
it is we also need to as the executable

00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:00,770
procedure and push it to the server push

00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:05,330
it to the imagery server and then the

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:09,520
image server will run it if there's no

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,520
major change to run with our wrong toast

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:19,240
then we can do some dynamic Blaine later

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,170
working on camel for quite a long time

00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:41,210
it's fair to say that I have Wynans the

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:45,590
involvement of camel and I found that a

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:47,070
lot of people have introduced the new

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:51,540
elements to camel

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:58,760
for the SOA in the past it was based on

00:22:51,540 --> 00:23:07,560
ESPE to do with message in camel walls

00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:10,880
route engine based on now we see some

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,170
typical scenarios which provide which

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,020
fundamental or basic service and based

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:19,590
on this basic service then we can

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:23,850
provide combined combinations of service

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:33,930
like in our case the notification system

00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:40,260
basedurn system system to provide this

00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:46,710
notification so this is we also have the

00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:48,690
micro service attack sure it also

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:53,850
involved a lot of manpower in order to

00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:58,610
run it therefore later now we can

00:23:53,850 --> 00:24:03,120
leverage your communities whether it is

00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:06,110
mesh which can help us to block the

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,330
network issues and we can also leverage

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:12,480
when it is a resource scheduling to

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:19,980
drive the routing rules that's why we

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:23,780
use the camo to do the service speaking

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,780
of this I want to talk about the cam ok

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,700
and then we're running camera

00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,610
application natively on the kubernetes

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,760
and they also provide a live voice

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,970
integration platform be it cam ok the

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,080
router policies can be deployed to the

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,420
banana

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,940
classic and later I want to tell you how

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:54,420
these one can be achieved River in beach

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:58,320
house and it also leveraged the upgraded

00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:02,330
as SDK and you can almost so ready to

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,330
the achievement of the say okay

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,450
Christa Nations yesterday and today we

00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,030
already covered these walls and we will

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:19,830
talk about that in details but will give

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:22,820
you a real concrete case and come okay

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:25,350
it builds the application on top of the

00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,900
united finding and i would like to give

00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,880
you some eternal explosion later and i

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,460
just tell you there are 20 lines of the

00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:39,690
code and we need to have to do is bring

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:43,560
closed we need yes and then for

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,720
outsourcing and we need to generate you

00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,810
are just a me right to deployed in the

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,360
c'mon Alex and we need to use the August

00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:53,970
rain for kids on the immediate and to

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,310
make it a project which can be running

00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,900
so there are a lot of things when you do

00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:02,310
behind the upon the lines of the cows

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:05,850
but how can we do that easily and if we

00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:07,860
pay attention the 20 lines of the code

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:16,740
well actually that is the jobs up they

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:20,280
come okay what's they do the resources

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:25,220
will be defined it as a CRT and finally

00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,220
they only use the one kids or one 12

00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:31,850
weeks and it will have the operator the

00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,850
operator

00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:39,340
controller it is for the dsm controller

00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:42,790
the controller will complete its job

00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:47,040
free somebody reported the compounding

00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:47,040
and after Kamali if the generates

00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:57,340
dependency spells they also be included

00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:59,440
in as well I just tell you that there

00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,690
are several language you use to it

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,570
evokes the PRL it can be the as I know

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:10,390
it can be other language such as a good

00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:12,250
knee or so you can use language to do

00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:15,040
this and then all the sudden the

00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:18,280
language can be recognized and after you

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,650
done this part the mirror will be built

00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:25,720
in after the mirror is pure able to

00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:28,660
point to automatic environment so will

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:35,020
it do it for us which we have to do

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:37,780
manually to use the Comeau of the

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:44,140
connecticut to create the dsl to analyze

00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:52,000
code it will do everything for you and

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:54,760
finally what we get is this is how the C

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,110
or D look in general you can see that

00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:04,150
you add these standard coburn a deep

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:06,100
thank for a sample data and is fast the

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:09,760
most important part of this path is the

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:12,670
last one and it is the 20 Ljubljana is

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,130
the other documents that we created and

00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:17,470
finally all the things we have to do

00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:21,720
manually and it has it can be automated

00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:25,450
and then we submit it and then generated

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,210
in the DSL will be changed very often

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,760
right so every time I change the SDL

00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:33,670
they will run in the backstage for us

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,160
the speed is really fast so that it can

00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:39,780
speed up application and integration

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,780
efficiency and productivity

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:50,430
this is a simple introduction of the

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,170
operator SDK and if you are each still

00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,120
Emma look at it and if you need to

00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,770
define see for yourself you think I

00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,080
think that it is quite complicated so

00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,510
what we need to do is to define and

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,520
describe the structure probably and then

00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:08,040
it will use the functions of the

00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:10,350
operator SDK will write code for you so

00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:15,990
what we need to do is to write code or

00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:18,690
controller so I think that the jobs of

00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,890
the deployment is really simple so if

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,920
you are interested you can have a look

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:25,830
at the code of CAM okay and now I would

00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:29,100
like to give you a brief demo of our

00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:33,510
environment so this is the demo which is

00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,130
the recorder of our screen but if we

00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,860
still have some time lapse I would like

00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,660
to give you a live demo and this is

00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,980
Cooper native environments we have

00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:46,820
already deployed and this screen shows

00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:50,850
that building in quite they chemically

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:54,660
upgraded to the economic environment and

00:29:50,850 --> 00:30:01,950
it is running on the kubernetes and this

00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:06,810
one the we need to deploy it as well and

00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:11,670
it will run a canopy instruction and

00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:15,000
then the deployment and operation will

00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:18,720
be done automatically and in this way we

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,450
can store it so what we create is the

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,670
user SD object and after this one is

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:27,300
created the operator will do everything

00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:29,610
for you you can see that it already has

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,820
already build a browser and has already

00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:35,820
deployed a browser and in here we need

00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:39,360
to word and then we can compare it our

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,620
requirements I'll convert it to the

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,559
command Alex

00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,179
and you can see that in mixed age the

00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,830
original service has already been

00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,200
recorded the first one is the best

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:53,429
service which has already been started

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,039
in the backstage the purpose is to deal

00:30:53,429 --> 00:31:00,419
with the application of the vesting of

00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:04,350
our guests for the visitors and this

00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:06,950
will not even aviation services and if

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:10,490
you are interested you can connect to it

00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:13,230
via your mobile phone it has already

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:16,679
deployed on the public network and if

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:21,570
you are interested you can join and this

00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:30,960
is a one is on the web socket so that

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:34,190
you can get the information you can see

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,190
it has already installed it

00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:46,040
well the application of the Cosmo has

00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,040
already been initiated

00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:11,030
the notification has already been sent

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,820
to the mobile phone of the receptionist

00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:18,030
well actually not winter is approaching

00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,750
well for different usage the users you

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:23,670
will receive different types of the

00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:27,020
message or notifications we can see that

00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,020
amount of visitors coming

00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:51,059
well this one is on a VIP a visitor yes

00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:51,539
he's a VIP okay so this stand of the

00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:55,440
demo

00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:58,889
dude chill the condemnation I'll go to

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,440
face or it's really quite um kinetic has

00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:04,259
already conventions for sometimes and I

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,859
don't do that for detail for the

00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:11,340
kinetics we don't use the bill we only

00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:13,769
use the sobbing and amending I mean the

00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:17,399
eventing of the canal April it may

00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:23,220
enable us to initiate it's the router so

00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:25,889
that standard loading can be did can be

00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,109
done automatically and I just mentioned

00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:32,519
that I can deploy to the sensor to the

00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:35,159
cloud and in the backstage it will be

00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:39,419
packed and turn that into the mirror

00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:41,159
automatically but currently we missed a

00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:44,249
time we don't have the time we don't

00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:47,399
know when we can pull it but with the

00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:50,609
service of the Canadians we can pull it

00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:53,129
break immediately and another one is the

00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:56,429
oh no scaling of the Canadian when you

00:33:53,129 --> 00:34:00,509
don't have any requests it can be down

00:33:56,429 --> 00:34:02,879
scale so the service instance can be

00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:06,059
turned into zero so in this way you can

00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:09,059
reduce the usage of zero so it is really

00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:14,429
useful in the IOT because in ILP the

00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:18,299
frequency is really low such as the door

00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:20,940
or your mom you need you'll need to open

00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:23,429
a door very open you open and close the

00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,700
door but there is no driver a really

00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:28,319
short time so if you don't just if you

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,270
don't have this kind of a scale to zero

00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:31,510
function you just

00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:35,210
using the resources it's kind of waste

00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:38,659
and it is also really helpful was to

00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:41,000
write the router code just when we did

00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:43,970
and I don't know the rest of you already

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,280
use the windows code before I don't know

00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,840
whether you did it before other was a

00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,520
long time ago maybe 10 years at that

00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,830
time you just press the button and then

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,090
which state corresponding process and

00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:58,660
face done but with the key native we can

00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:04,970
do with that really conveniently and

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:07,580
come of rotor standard we can also do

00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:11,290
that we're the corresponding kids which

00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,290
provided by the chemcam okay

00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:07,010
provide connectivity but can be

00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:09,590
connected to the clean up surveys on a

00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:14,410
common area so that your application can

00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:16,420
be loaded each day on a common idea and

00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:20,030
Mario's we just mentioned can be

00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:23,150
separated according to the requirements

00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:27,260
request of the page this we can call all

00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:29,810
the audios according to the scenarios

00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,330
well actually due to the commutation we

00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:34,160
cannot have too much and if you are

00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:37,730
interested you can scan the QR code the

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,550
right hand side is the website of em

00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:45,320
okay and on the left hand side it is the

00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:47,960
chatting group of the chemical for the

00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,860
request or the qaol you can you're

00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,110
welcome to join us

00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:53,240
actually all this time has already made

00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:55,460
available it is written by the Python

00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,930
language it's very simple and so much

00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,170
Commerce and make a very much for your

00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:02,570
time so any questions from the floor and

00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:06,580
if you have any questions we are welcome

00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:09,620
to talk to is privately later or now and

00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:11,780
if you don't have any questions while

00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:17,480
