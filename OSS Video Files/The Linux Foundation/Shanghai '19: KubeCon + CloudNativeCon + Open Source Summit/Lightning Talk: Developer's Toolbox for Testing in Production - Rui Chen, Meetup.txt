	Lightning Talk: Developer's Toolbox for Testing in Production - Rui Chen, Meetup 

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 â€“ April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

In the software development lifycle, test pyramid helps to build confidence for launching the feature.  While single code change is easy to manage,  testing a whole feature in the system are facing the increasing challenges in the microservice world.    While maintaining multiple environments would help sort out the promotion path,  but it is involved with tremendous efforts cross the teams and very costly for the business as well,  that is how "Testing in Production (TIP)" becomes popular.    In this session, I want to talk about some of the TIP practices that we do at Meetup for delivering features.  Especially think about the feature delivery from developer experience perspective.
