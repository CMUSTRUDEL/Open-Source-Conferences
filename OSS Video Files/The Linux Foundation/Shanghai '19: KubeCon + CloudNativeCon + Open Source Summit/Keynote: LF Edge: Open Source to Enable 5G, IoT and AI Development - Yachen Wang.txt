hi good morning so my name is Laura

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,519
I'm from Tencent and it's a great

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,839
pleasure and honor for me to be invited

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,570
here to talk about our computing and

00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,880
just now the previous speakers has

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,010
mentioned that in the open source

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,920
actually now we always talk about edge

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,910
and edge computing and also at open

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,210
source and I'm very pleased to be here

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,540
on behalf of Tencent cloud and that you

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:40,020
give a brief introduction about the

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,660
progress and also especially for Tencent

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,180
in terms of open source and also in edge

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,930
what kind of things we have done so far

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,660
so when talk about a Linux Foundation

00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:55,469
well as we have mentioned actually we

00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:00,750
have established a half umbrella so it

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:04,110
is an umbrella project and the basically

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,110
is to unify the edge computing projects

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,150
and three years ago this become a

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,549
buzzword everyone is talking about is

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,640
talking about the architecture for edge

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,369
computing and also what kind of add-ons

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,070
we need to have and also in terms of

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,250
open source we began to discuss what

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,530
kind of open source business need edge

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,930
computing and the distance the data from

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,479
the Linux Foundation so for the

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,540
non-traditional industries for instance

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,439
like IOT they need to have the low

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,180
latency guarantees for instance like VR

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,759
and all of the are gaming and also

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,840
cloud-based the gaming and they all have

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,990
ADD amount of water

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,880
edge computing and also IOT so we have a

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,619
lot of different scenarios of

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,420
application and the jabot has said that

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,140
we need to think about the different

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,719
layers of edge for instance a iot edge

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,570
another enterprise edge and a cloud edge

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,659
and we need to work from the button from

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,000
the base like all the hypervisor and

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,730
also the containerization and other

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,569
virtualization and also for the parts of

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,360
this house

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,819
build all of them so for the Linux

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,069
Foundation will have a full key project

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,060
in order to integrate all the edge

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:26,849
computing and open source projects and

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:30,090
to provide you a kind of a guidance in

00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:33,269
terms of which technology to choose so

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,700
for these four projects well at the main

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:38,670
world we have four but actually for the

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,810
RFS it is no more than four so we have

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:46,109
our green oh and it is the English is

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:49,379
called a blueprint so I can give you an

00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:52,079
example basically it is focused on

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:54,840
scenario how to use our open source

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:57,720
technology to build a platform for edge

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,510
computing and maybe these are existing

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,989
technology for instance PRS and as a

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:07,620
given area technology or the DVD tape

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:11,280
and for the existing to use the existing

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,859
architecture and also technology and but

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,579
it needs to first of all to specify a

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:20,699
Genaro and currently it has 11 in a row

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:25,799
architecture guidance available and also

00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:28,680
we have EBE home made homage and also

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,019
EDX and the basic relatives are for the

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,199
IOT and also for the home based is

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:37,980
narrow and the other one is more for the

00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:42,900
IOT is narrow nav is works like a

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:45,870
operating system for the edge computing

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,209
and if you are interested in this or you

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,120
can go to the website and to get more

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,819
knowledge about it and a portes and what

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,159
is our focus actually this morning board

00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:01,310
has already talked about it in terms of

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,690
in terms of the deployment based on

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:07,799
containerization and also ash competing

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:10,859
in terms of their network side so we

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:14,729
still and find that we're still missing

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:16,620
some functions for instance the unified

00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:20,729
between a cloud unification between

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,580
cloud and edge and 4000 our focus is

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:24,680
more like your

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,010
we're more focused on autonomous driving

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,310
and also IOT in manufacturing and also

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,990
in terms of cloud gaming so we still

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,470
have some pain points for instance we

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,470
need a larger bandwidth and five tree

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,750
can provide a solution and also we need

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,480
to have low latency another five tree

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:47,590
can help us with that as well and also

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,630
we need to have an end-to-end

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,270
architecture and for instance to

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,970
guarantee the low latency and for all

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,450
these pinpointing other to solve it to

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:03,110
solve them we need to get the help from

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:06,500
our newest technologies and for Tencent

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:10,700
we also have the sole quality sex online

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,580
platform and it is the Tencent smart

00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,220
edge connector it is a connector and a

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,160
basic way to connect various and also

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,310
our edge computing platform and also to

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,550
connect our edge cloud and as a central

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:28,580
cloud and also here are its features as

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:32,030
a function so first of all is about

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:36,070
mobile traffic offloading and the full 5

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:39,770
- also I talked about MSE and in the

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:42,770
station we hopefully we can replicate to

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,930
divide the traffic and therefore we need

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,660
to have this function the mobile traffic

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,230
offloading and also we need to have the

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,300
network acceleration so why we need to

00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:58,400
have acceleration function for instance

00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,410
now we have the live streaming module

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,620
and therefore we need to have the

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:06,800
network acceleration and also for

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:11,840
audience for game players we need to

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:15,920
have the well on demand acceleration and

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,790
therefore how can we very flexibly

00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,770
to change that network and also we the

00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:25,460
search function is so called edge

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:28,670
traffic quality and in order to

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:31,760
guarantee a high performance and also

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,430
for instance how can we create a very

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,840
safety environment of our

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:41,890
the tunnel and also we need to have the

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,370
very high performance data handling and

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:48,190
we need to have a unified access and in

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,530
other to have the high efficiency high

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:54,010
efficient sorting and other load

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:56,890
balancing so everything needs to find a

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,990
solution other to sack and also apart

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:02,320
from mobile network also will focus on

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:06,640
IOT scenarios as well we hope 30sec can

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:10,720
become a architecture and to provide a

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:14,710
unified protocol and this is about 80

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,530
sec and just now I talked about these

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,180
functions and the behind dated areas are

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,810
kids in order to realize the function

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:27,160
and for this slide and we talked about

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:29,680
TS exposition in our network we are a

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,710
connector we need to connect the

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,080
different network and also the upper

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,660
level that is the crowd structure

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:42,190
architecture and therefore we society

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:46,030
that is a connector it is it is a port

00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:49,270
connector in the whole system and also

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:52,630
for these two charts you can see clearly

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:55,090
how can we enable a what kind of

00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:57,730
technologies to enable such a platform

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,980
and Linux Foundation already talked

00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,920
about how can we enable infrastructure

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,260
deploy infrastructure and for instance

00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,760
virtual machine and also

00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,740
containerization and also we need to

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,880
talk about a for instance operating

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,470
system and also at our containerization

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,860
and a46

00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:21,160
we are a past service provider for the

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:24,190
network level and just now we talked

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,930
about a cloud data center and we are the

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,880
connector between a carer between the

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,120
vendor and other ourselves and also the

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,120
cloud

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,240
just now we talked about the edge

00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,820
computing and it's open source and when

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,370
we look at the T sector we hope that we

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:47,490
can use a lot of open source technology

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:50,070
to build it so last month we put forward

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,810
a proposal to Linux the foundation that

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:57,089
is looking at the scenario of IOT and

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:02,250
the scenario of a game and the two

00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:06,269
points pro pointer was that proposed and

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,089
we also will have a lot offer there

00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:11,279
TBD K and as a VPP acceleration

00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:13,440
technology which are based around the

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,300
open source development we also look at

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,510
is a lot balance so they are floating

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,180
and double-parked and technology when

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:24,029
the printer was given to Linux

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:28,079
Foundation we also we look at existing

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:30,930
technology the Linux elf will tell us

00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:33,240
what and how to use that the open source

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,040
technology and we also hope data our

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,870
open source technology can be upstream

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,360
to the new leaks foundation to build a

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:43,139
real sense of the open source also look

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:48,839
at the architectures verification and we

00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:52,589
work on the tea set technology on the

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:56,790
clock gaming and also for looking at the

00:09:52,589 --> 00:10:01,199
cloud gaming development and also on the

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:03,540
digital technology over the mwk 2019 we

00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:06,060
also will showcase the technology

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:09,149
quickly due to the IOT application and

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,699
mix the will help us to utilize the

00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:14,250
coordination between the network and the

00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:14,519
etch and we are very glad to meet all of

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,170
you

00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:22,910
and we hope to have a communication with

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:27,449
you based on visa we try to open account

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:34,410
and this is about 5 g NR iot open

00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:36,569
cooperation in Tencent we have a ongoing
