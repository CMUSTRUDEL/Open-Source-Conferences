	Sponsored Keynote: Cloud Native Best Practices - Burt Liu, Vice President, Tencent Cloud 

Tencent is using Cloud Native technologies in a wide variety of its core products, including WeChat, QQ, and video games, playing a critical part in their success. Weâ€™d like to share lessons and experiences learned while adopting and developing these Cloud Native solutions for Tencent scale -- showcasing how these battle-hardened technologies have found their way into the DNA of Tencent cloud -- enabling the same success for our Cloud customers.

hi good morning everyone so my name is a

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,370
partner

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,530
I'm from Tenzin crowd and it's a great

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,019
honour for me to be here to share with

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,350
you the experience we accumulated in

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:20,070
terms of cloud native and the whole

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,920
Tencent cloud what hasn't well actually

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,859
for the total server is more than 1

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,930
million units and also for the

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:32,550
containers number and other functions

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:35,910
number years Billings is at Billings so

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,879
such a immense number to support key

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,239
queue and also gaming consent aiming and

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,340
as a widget for their stable operation

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,879
and during the journey we have

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,180
accumulated a lot of a best practice and

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,250
therefore we have the tension to crowd

00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,559
container platform and it can be used

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,020
for government for financial industry

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:03,210
and also for some traditional

00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:08,299
manufacturing industry with civilization

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:13,950
is more the more accepted by the users

00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:17,250
we also have officially build the other

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,400
browser container cloud platform this is

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:26,909
a quadratic and the price the technique

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:31,920
can help other users to privatize their

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:36,150
containers and the fundamental layers in

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,500
the in accordance with the public cloud

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:45,180
over Tencent and this will help with the

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:52,070
hybrid cloud management and also inside

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,070
consent we also worked on the humanities

00:01:52,470 --> 00:02:04,080
practices and development and also with

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:07,479
the management we can make it with

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,000
monarch wear analogy and more

00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:13,630
controllable with the online and offline

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,900
operation we also can help with the

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:22,390
efficiency of the resources the

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:29,020
utilization and here I want to talk

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:36,760
about that instant cloud GDE mesh with

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:38,920
the development of tea chaos the control

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,040
and the management requirement is

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,450
getting higher they are taking English

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,820
in from interview and it is so simply

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:53,050
seamlessly connected always a ten-cent

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:57,340
cloud and once you learn the 30 very

00:02:53,050 --> 00:03:00,220
much you work out.the harmonizer service

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,260
and this also will be used in the hybrid

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,690
cloud and their edge computing in the

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,130
future

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:14,860
so with this efficiency we also hope to

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:19,030
constantly decrease the compromising of

00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:21,220
the performance from the mesh like some

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,370
of the workload will be put into the

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:29,920
smuggling and these can help to reduce

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:38,560
the consumption of the performance the

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:41,049
service is most popular computing

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,030
platform with the highest growth rate

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:50,220
from May 2010 a cent in growth rate is

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:54,830
very high but it also has some

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:59,100
shut witness like the event of a

00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:03,090
development a part and the medicine is

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:06,480
not what the developer got used to and

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:11,180
internal scenarios in the performance is

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:16,230
not asserted at the others in launching

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:19,380
its start is also kind of the flow also

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:21,980
we hope that with the HTTP function

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:26,310
within five minutes our users can

00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:29,130
develop a web service and the language

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,950
in support includes the Java of tears

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:34,590
and these are the common ones

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:37,460
these can be seamlessly transferred to a

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,860
vertebrate platform and in the future

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:50,760
more language will be used English a

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:54,150
platform and last but not least we will

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,490
have the computer simulator solution

00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,090
including the monetary and debugging and

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:03,210
alert and we have realized outside a

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:08,790
virtualization to serve the issue or

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:11,820
with the security and isolation and for

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:15,360
the performance and experience we also

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:18,210
hope to keep it in the top position in

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,880
these industry and to have the real-time

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:27,750
and a smooth experiences provided to our

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:33,720
users last year we work with a WeChat

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:38,720
and paid the mini program cloud service

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:43,770
at platform this service is very great

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,550
after one year we have seen perfect

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:50,300
development

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:56,120
apparently your 160,000 developers are

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:58,580
using the mini program service and the

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,210
users will pay more attention to their

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:07,180
own logic code and the development cost

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:10,610
is smaller and now we are constantly

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:13,360
improving the experience so in the

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,210
future we believe that there will be

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,910
more support even to other developers in

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,780
the future when you are developing the

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:26,210
mini programs in big chat the first

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,730
thing you can think of is other services

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:33,790
or service or front consent so we hope

00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:36,920
that we can bring you with more

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:40,910
efficient and smooth experiences and

00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:43,340
this is about develop service which is a

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:47,180
one-stop service we look at the

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:50,210
deployment the efficiency and the whole

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:54,350
system laid out last year we developed

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:57,430
we invested in coding and in this year

00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,500
we will have their talking on 2.0

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,230
launched it includes the software

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,100
development from the beginning to the

00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:11,960
delivery and including the program

00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:14,530
management Azure code management thank

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,530
