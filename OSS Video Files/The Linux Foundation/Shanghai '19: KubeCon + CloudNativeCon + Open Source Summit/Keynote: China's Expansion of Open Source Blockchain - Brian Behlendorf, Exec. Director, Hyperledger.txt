Playlist: Shanghai '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit
Description: 
	Keynote: China's Expansion of Open Source Blockchain - Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director, Hyperledger 

Last year, Asia saw an increase of developers adopting and creating smart contract and distributed ledger applications for enterprise. Now, more than 50 China-based companies are Hyperledger members - making up 20% of total membership. These companies are building blockchain-based systems that are changing data and information flow globally. Examples include Tencent building an enterprise level blockchain infrastructure service platform; Alibaba applying blockchain to non-profit organizations, product traceability, and more, and Baidu launching China’s first blockchain-supported asset-backed security project and blockchain-based ABS exchange.  In this keynote, Brian explores the activity in open source blockchain development in China. He’ll examine production use cases across industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain challenges and opportunities implementing the technology.

yeah thank you for having me here

00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,189
thought I would spend a very quick ten

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,269
minutes just giving you an update on the

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,519
hyper literate

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,370
a lot of really exciting things

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,740
happening for us here in China my hope

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,050
is that if you're not already looking at

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,640
this technology or playing with it that

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,830
this inspires you to kind of give it a

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,660
look and to think about some of the ways

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,109
that it can be used to solve some real

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,820
world problems today so hyper ledger is

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,520
again many of you know where a project

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,040
hosted embedded entirely inside the

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,149
Linux Foundation like many of the other

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,280
projects here it's a three year old open

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,890
source project to advance cross industry

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,510
blockchain technologies and when we

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,640
think about blockchain technology it's

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,170
not really the cryptocurrency side of

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,120
that that's interesting and there's a

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,039
lot of people focused on that this is

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,500
really more about the use of two

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,050
technologies in particular distributed

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Ledger's and smart contract systems and

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,340
lots of different ways that that plays

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,049
out but this has been a three year long

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,909
effort to go and build a series of

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,520
technologies that make it possible for

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,520
you to go out and build blockchain

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,680
networks and just in the same way that

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,140
the Linux Foundation has a whole set of

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,049
projects like hyper ledger even within

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,900
hyper ledger we have a whole series of

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,119
projects we call it the hyper ledger

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,670
greenhouse to try to get across the

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,070
sense that these are technology projects

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,770
that are distinct from each other but

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,840
they share a lot of things in common

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:36,630
they share a common operating system

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,329
like oh sorry open-source license the

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,430
apache license of course alright they

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,340
share a common development methodology

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,110
this is all built out in the public but

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,090
they offer some very different features

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,530
and functionality and I won't go into

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,890
too much depth there's a lot more

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,470
information on the hyper litter but just

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,729
to give kind of a taste so many of you

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,549
perhaps have heard of hyper ledger

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,110
fabric fabric is a very widely deployed

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,390
I'll show some information about it

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,009
later about how widely it's used and a

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,560
bunch of examples of where it's being

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,780
used and it's a very mature platform now

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,960
for building all sorts of different

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,760
blockchain applications

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,830
but even within hyper ledger we have

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,670
competition because we believe very

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,160
strongly

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,220
just like in databases and programming

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,720
languages and even in operating systems

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,030
sometimes it's good to have a set of

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,920
options when you go out to try to solve

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,540
a problem right and there's a lot of

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,060
different ideas out there about the

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,400
right way to do a distributed ledger the

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,930
right way to do a smart contract so we

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,480
have another project called sawtooth

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,600
which takes a very different approach to

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,460
this sawtooth has some novel attributes

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,230
that make it easier to plug many

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,420
different kinds of smart contract

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,460
engines in as well as support much

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,870
larger networks of nodes on a

00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,230
permissioned and perhaps even

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,850
unpermitted network basis other projects

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,040
at hyper let our focused on digital

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,950
identity for example hyper ledger indie

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,140
very much on that and others that go up

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,630
the stack so to speak to start thinking

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,550
about whole categories of use cases that

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,560
might be appropriate for this so hyper

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,290
ledger grid for example is very much

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,480
focused on supply chain applications you

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,030
can pick up grid it happens to run on

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,220
top of sawtooth and very quickly have a

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,560
supply chain traceability solution in

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,960
place lots of other things to talk about

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,330
but I we're really moving in the

00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,310
direction of components and libraries

00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,470
and templates that will allow for a lot

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,180
of mixing and matching partly because we

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,310
believe what will happen in the long

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,140
term is all these different blockchain

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,000
technologies out there in the world will

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,310
start to consolidate will start to

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,890
combine and maybe converge in the same

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,510
way that the Linux operating system

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,950
converged a lot of the server operating

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,140
system world over the last twenty years

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,630
and we'd like to be there to help that

00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,670
convergence be a very graceful kind of

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,860
process for users of blockchain

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,740
technology out there so lots of things

00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,540
to investigate in here a lot of momentum

00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,890
in the public project I won't spend too

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,620
much time on this but again in three

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:06,350
years we've had lots of different

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,150
projects launch lots of different people

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,680
take our EDX course over a hundred

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,600
thousand different people taking the

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,270
public training about how to build a

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,940
hyper ledger network I we have a whole

00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:21,109
lot of members as part of hyper ledger

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:23,690
in fact I hire ledger fabric itself has

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,210
gotten very widely deployed out there in

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,389
fact every major

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,500
public cloud now supports hyper ledger

00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:34,930
fabric so both inside of China so Baidu

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,330
$0.10 le and Y way on all of their

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,610
public clouds they offer the ability to

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,039
stand up a fabric node or even a full

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,110
fabric network as well as build up

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,000
networks that span multiple clouds at

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,069
the same time but also all the public

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,440
clouds outside of China support that as

00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:51,970
well and it's really hard to get a sense

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,220
for market share like how many people

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,259
are using hyper ledger technologies for

00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,080
enterprise blockchain applications

00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,970
versus the competitors there's not a lot

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,080
of competitors there's a couple of

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,229
they're known as kurta and chorim and

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,030
some of the public etherium or even

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,530
Enterprise etherium clients arguably our

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,020
competition here there

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,180
Forbes did a survey recently of 50 very

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,949
large companies and found that over

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,880
thirty five of them are using hyper

00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:23,139
ledger fabric or fabric derived versions

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,610
and then even more of them are using

00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:26,889
some of the other projects that hyper

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,139
ledger so really a good sense that we're

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:32,740
becoming kind of that linux kind of

00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:34,990
dominant play here here in china we have

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,130
a lot of great members a lot of great

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:41,830
support as I mentioned the the major

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,750
organizations that run clouds are all

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,990
not only supporting fabric but also

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,430
members of ours but you'll also see and

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,639
it might be hard from the screen from

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:55,060
that distance a lot of other types of

00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,990
large organizations like Lenovo or JD

00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,430
comm a very big e-commerce plays

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,490
companies in the supply chain space like

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:08,860
h3 see a lot of banks like China min

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:10,360
Qiang Bank china citic Bank and a lot a

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,919
lot of interesting organizations and

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,020
another one called Beijing genomics

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,849
Institute that I'll mention in a bit but

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,180
as well as a lot of startups in the

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,530
energy sector in the healthcare sector

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,570
lots of folks who are pulling this

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,729
together we've also pulled together a

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,880
real collection of the different

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:30,070
universities here at Peking University

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,830
Jiang Jiang University as well as the

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,080
Chinese Academy of information and

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,449
communication technologies which is the

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,370
predominant organization in the Chinese

00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:43,000
government setting blockchain

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,580
see for for the companies and for here

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,169
in China and for the nation but the

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,729
heart of what we do has got to be about

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,740
developers right at the heart of every

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:52,540
linux foundation project it doesn't

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,280
matter how much press coverage you're

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,960
getting how much corporate interest

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,669
you're getting or momentum out there

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,250
unless you're actually getting code

00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:02,110
written and from the very beginning of

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,820
the project when I first joined you know

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:09,310
should just after it started in 2016 I

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:11,199
came to Shanghai for a a theory immed

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,840
Avella / conference hosted just across

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,100
the river and started to meet a lot of

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,870
people who were thinking about the

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,300
application of blockchain tech to the

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,820
enterprise that's where we really got

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,430
started and recognized that China needed

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,220
to have a first-class position in the

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,540
blockchain space and in hyper ledger the

00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,639
hyper ledger needed to be a global

00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,100
technology and so in addition to all

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,229
those members we also have a tremendous

00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,199
amount of software coming in from

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:40,419
developers I here in China about 15

00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,770
percent as best we can tell because

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,010
sometimes it's hard to tell where

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,330
contributions come from but also many of

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,820
the projects in hyper ledger like

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,820
caliper which is a benchmarking tool

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:54,039
actually started as project written

00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,050
originally by developers here in China

00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:58,990
and a key part of that outreach as well

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,030
has been engagement through meetups

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,970
engagement through kind of face to face

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,580
small events that we've done in March we

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,169
did what we called a bootcamp in Hong

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,510
Kong which had quite a bit of

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,849
participation from developers in China

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,849
and our boot camps are really designed

00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:18,280
not to just be a hackathon or a training

00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:22,830
environment but intended to try to help

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,310
bring the developer community along with

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,320
understanding how to become a

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,020
contributor to the project right how do

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,720
we get past the language barriers how do

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,419
we get past the cultural barriers how do

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,760
we really engage with the global hyper

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,709
ledger open-source community if only to

00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,469
get our answers questions answered

00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:43,570
and/or our bugs fixed or but really

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:46,420
hopefully to become Co developers on

00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,600
that so look for future boot camps soon

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:52,490
and also we do quite a few of these

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,630
meetups and gatherings in Shanghai and

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,300
Bing in Hangzhou in Shenzhen oh and I

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,120
think 15 different cities have had hyper

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,209
ledger events now so I watch for that I

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,220
have a series of four different examples

00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:09,500
of where people out there using it

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,850
please download the presentation deck

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,160
I'm not going to have the chance to go

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,370
through all of them very quickly

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,050
JD comm built a blockchain network to

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,899
provide a lot of different functionality

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,779
in finance in supply chain traceability

00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:26,029
and in settling legal disputes they

00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:30,260
actually built a system that talks to

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:32,260
the Hangzhou sorry the the yeah the

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,149
Guangzhou internet court system so that

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,589
contracts and agreements between

00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,050
businesses doing business in Guangzhou

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,930
can be presented as evidence in a court

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,580
trial that you know that you're looking

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,709
at all the right evidence and it's all

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,779
time-stamped and those stamps are stored

00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:49,790
on a blockchain network $0.10 cloud

00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:51,649
launched a really interesting project

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,740
around warehouse receipts and being able

00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:56,480
to finance them and and they saw a lot

00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,820
of advantages that you would expect from

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,740
digitalising and otherwise paper-based

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,839
process but the key thing here is that

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,450
blockchain technology is being used to

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,180
replace things like signatures on pieces

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,220
of paper and faxes and phone calls and

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,190
all of this really heavy-duty overhead

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,450
that otherwise we depend upon humans to

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,890
do with each other

00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,810
and that's so that we can get to a sense

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,120
of trust lots of other big projects that

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:23,630
without the time to talk about in trade

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:27,079
finance also in genetics being able to

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,279
trace the ownership of data and and

00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,860
where it comes from and have people

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,589
given the permission to properly analyze

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,959
that data in the search for cures for

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,700
cancer all this amazing stuff and it's

00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,680
all happening here in China and it's

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,570
happening on hyper ledger technologies

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,480
and it's really exciting to be a part of

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,950
this big thing together so lots more

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,070
information available at the hyper laser

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,990
website as well as a lot of us are very

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,750
reachable on all sorts of systems

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,880
including WeChat so please get involved

00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,680
and hopefully we can talk about your

00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,770
project here on stage next year thank

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,399
you

00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,399
