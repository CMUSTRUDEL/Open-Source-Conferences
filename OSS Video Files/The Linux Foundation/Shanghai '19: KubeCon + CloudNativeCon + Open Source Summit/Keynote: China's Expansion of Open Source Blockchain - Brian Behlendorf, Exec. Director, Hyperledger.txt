	Keynote: China's Expansion of Open Source Blockchain - Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director, Hyperledger 

Last year, Asia saw an increase of developers adopting and creating smart contract and distributed ledger applications for enterprise. Now, more than 50 China-based companies are Hyperledger members - making up 20% of total membership. These companies are building blockchain-based systems that are changing data and information flow globally. Examples include Tencent building an enterprise level blockchain infrastructure service platform; Alibaba applying blockchain to non-profit organizations, product traceability, and more, and Baidu launching China’s first blockchain-supported asset-backed security project and blockchain-based ABS exchange.  In this keynote, Brian explores the activity in open source blockchain development in China. He’ll examine production use cases across industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain challenges and opportunities implementing the technology.
