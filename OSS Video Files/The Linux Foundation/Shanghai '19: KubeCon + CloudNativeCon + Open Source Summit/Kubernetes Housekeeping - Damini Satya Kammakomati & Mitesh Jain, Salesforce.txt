	Kubernetes Housekeeping - Damini Satya Kammakomati & Mitesh Jain, Salesforce 

One of the big challenges of running large scale distributed systems like Kubernetes is managing resources. The efficiency and long term operational readiness of such systems depends on how well the resource utilization is monitored and managed. Kubernetes provides a plethora of options and mechanisms to track and handle resources. However, like any other system, the best way to tune it is to know these options, mechanisms and more importantly understand them.    This session will explain various mechanisms available in Kubernetes to manage the resources. We will deep dive into concepts like Garbage Collection Controller, Kube Controller Manager, Eviction, and Kubelet Garbage Collection, providing details of how they work, how to configure them and what are the recommended settings.
