	Lightning Talk: Cluster of Palm-Sized Personal Kubernetes Clusters Using 100 Raspberry Pi - Masaya Aoyama, CyberAgent, Inc 

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 – April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

https://adtech.cyberagent.io/techblog/archives/4340  Using 100 Raspberry Pi, we build an at home personal Kubernetes cluster.    The era of having your own personal kubernetes cluster at home is here!  We have gathered over 30 university students in order to recruit them into ranks of Kubernetes fans.    First, each of them created a personal Kubernetes cluster with 3 Raspberry pi.  After that, we gathered everyone’s clusters, connected them to a 48 port switch and attempted to create a cluster of kubernetes clusters.    In this session, I will talk about a challenges building a cluster of kubernetes cluster.  And also, I will introduce an engaging way not to only learn about kubernetes but also to provide experience of building one.  This method of teaching will increase the number of Kubernetes fans around the world.
