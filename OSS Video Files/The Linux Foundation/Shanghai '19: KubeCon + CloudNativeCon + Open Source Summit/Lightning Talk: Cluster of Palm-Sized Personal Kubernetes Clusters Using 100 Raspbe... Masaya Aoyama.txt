Description: 
	Lightning Talk: Cluster of Palm-Sized Personal Kubernetes Clusters Using 100 Raspberry Pi - Masaya Aoyama, CyberAgent, Inc 

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 – April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

https://adtech.cyberagent.io/techblog/archives/4340  Using 100 Raspberry Pi, we build an at home personal Kubernetes cluster.    The era of having your own personal kubernetes cluster at home is here!  We have gathered over 30 university students in order to recruit them into ranks of Kubernetes fans.    First, each of them created a personal Kubernetes cluster with 3 Raspberry pi.  After that, we gathered everyone’s clusters, connected them to a 48 port switch and attempted to create a cluster of kubernetes clusters.    In this session, I will talk about a challenges building a cluster of kubernetes cluster.  And also, I will introduce an engaging way not to only learn about kubernetes but also to provide experience of building one.  This method of teaching will increase the number of Kubernetes fans around the world.

Nihao today I'd like to talk about home

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:11,759
height personnel cabinets presser i'm

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,690
messiah and i'm infrastructure engineer

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:20,670
and I'm working at cyber agent main my

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:22,859
main job is implementing kubernetes as a

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,330
service platform on the private world

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:30,269
which include customized ingress

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,960
controller for container native load

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:37,890
balancing and also I'm a conference call

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:43,590
chair and meetup organizers in the term

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:49,670
I like Cuba natives probably I belong

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:53,610
like a Cuban it is indeed so of course

00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:57,020
everyone have a personal coven it's

00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:04,860
cluster just like a smartphone right

00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:08,490
like this if you have this cursor you

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:14,970
can use cluster in the coffee shop on

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:21,210
the airplane in the kitchen you can use

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:26,939
physical cluster anywhere this is at if

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:30,689
you take take this cursor into the

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:33,960
airplane for taking effort taking a

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:38,189
photo please be careful

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,000
some people said if this cursor is a

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:45,990
bomb yeah this this is not a bomb this

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,549
is a cluster why this is Russia is

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:54,299
suitable only for Cyrus no I'd like to

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:57,479
attract non-cuban it's user and provide

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:02,520
an opportunity to long and of course

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:10,250
enjoy so we gather the student and we'll

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:10,250
crust her for increasing kubernetes one

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,490
step we need to build a hard way cluster

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,010
and sorry ha

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:27,420
I think palm-sized and single outlet is

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:33,240
important so we decide to use USB power

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:36,300
supply and then install the cabinet's

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:42,510
installed kubernetes cluster into the

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:45,030
lobby pi of course we need to get

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,000
through the hard way for understanding

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,890
kubernetes debrie of course we can use

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,270
cube atom cube atom is so good but cube

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,720
atom is in so cuban it is in the black

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,709
box

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:09,900
but so i think we need to build build a

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:13,920
crosser atomically once if we do that we

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,890
will understanding kubernetes consists

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,920
of some component like cube api server

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:24,840
cube proxy a cube scheduler or a long

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:33,330
time and what is doing and how it works

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:38,100
and in addition we can try a coaster

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:43,290
component is ray for example metal lb is

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:47,880
a good solution for the type of load

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:50,100
balancer services but L to up mode is a

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:55,079
little bit danger in the data center

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:59,820
network but if this processor if we have

00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:02,280
a disk rester we can test easily without

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,000
worrying about the other computer or

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,760
network of course you can any testing

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,540
for both infrastructure and your

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:21,120
application but it just boring

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:24,120
so I create a crosstab Prosser we build

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:30,150
a large processor with chatty little

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,930
crosser with 100 Raspberry Pi future

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:37,710
work

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:45,000
I'd like to get x86 personal processor

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:48,090
so I want to try in turn to use Intel

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,580
nook and kind kind stand for cabinets in

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:56,850
docker kind run docker containers as a

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,100
cabinet slot in a single machine so we

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,360
can build a marginal kubernetes cluster

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:07,500
in a single machine and of course today

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:14,039
loudly by for its announced so I'd like

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:15,780
to build with it we like communities get

00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:20,410
your palms heights personal cuban

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:24,259
espresso like your smartphone thank you

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,259
