Oh freaking Casey up is the teacher I'm

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,740
very glad to meet all of you here and

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:14,429
good morning I'm very glad to be the

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:20,290
open source sunny participant and today

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:22,310
I will talk about the open source l ITC

00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:26,539
[Applause]

00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:29,130
the building were friendly and shared

00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:35,010
content networking framework to enable

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:37,980
industry digitization and many of you if

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,879
you're young you can remember that you

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,690
when you're going to get website eat

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:50,489
celery you the Minnesota that is already

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,250
digital life and actually so the world

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:58,079
is a fundamentally different from those

00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:01,789
years if we look at the applications if

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,430
I take a trilogy as an example the

00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:09,420
applications based around a generator

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,700
and the electricity equipment has a

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,060
fundamental ancient peoples our way of

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:20,790
life and the general motor has become

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:32,909
the benchmark of the process early years

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:35,820
and in 1914 production I was and the

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,970
merger application of the electricity

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,360
also generated over the production

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:46,049
revolution the IT technology as an

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,450
example the years are either the

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,210
technology invention and other items

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:56,110
itself the constant development

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:59,020
Theresa people's life and billing years

00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:02,590
the next Ursula here that incentive used

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:05,020
as a generic technology to disrupt a

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,840
flight change these traditional

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:13,420
industries and make meat into the

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:16,660
digitisation consciously ICT technology

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,870
they'll cross the stage either like

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:25,800
tonight the e-commerce and a public

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:30,840
cloud broken through stages different

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:38,350
very stage ready to acquire the market

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:41,800
and you said no differentiation is

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:45,459
improved and the resources and having

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:49,269
conquered the e-commerce and the public

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:51,660
cloud is going into the platform

00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:55,060
development and differentiated

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,880
experience has that becomes a major

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,340
feature and in the recent years or the

00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,549
comments and the public cloud the

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,730
council works it into a white ground and

00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:09,660
they can have a value exchange and there

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,959
are infinite that unlived business model

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:17,440
so it is very immersive trial and forth

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:20,380
in platform and the desk old technology

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,079
and also the innovation of an enabling

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:28,959
technology leasing sir the development

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:32,250
over the technology and with the

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,440
uncertainty of the plant we will see the

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,000
value will be generated

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,220
[Music]

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,340
for the digitalization of the industry

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,440
wait times look are to the only and

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,120
there are three types of a technology

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:54,320
the first answer for the file from a

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,440
2010 to 2020 there are sectors of our

00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,560
companies emerged and then tied it out

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,530
and this industry has gone through the

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,870
roller coaster assess a pattern of death

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:10,370
development and it is a quite a

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:13,610
fragmented the sustainable divestment it

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,370
has not be realized the second is a

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:24,020
realization this started from the

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:29,750
geography has given the optimization of

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:33,010
their internal process and has achieved

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:36,140
at the faster practices and the key

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:39,710
challenge is that it is a not open it is

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:43,790
just a the local optimization and the

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:46,160
value brought about the images and the

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:49,220
search is the remote medical service

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,400
this contractor is there put forward 14

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,740
years ago but now the infection rate is

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,370
only a present because the

00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:02,960
infrastructure that network is a nauseam

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:06,830
and today the distance or remote service

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:10,540
in the medical field cannot be realized

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,830
in five today sandwich so by

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,950
fertilization getting improved the

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,140
episode of platform and also the network

00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,990
will see the structural issues we need

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:24,510
to change the parameter

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,000
our solution is attributed are often

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,340
quite easily framework and enable the

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,250
digitization there are three layers of a

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,620
filter

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,630
architecture the upper one is a position

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:43,290
we need to change the people at rent

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:47,820
model and to have the ecosystem in any

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:50,580
mode and second the meadow layer the

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,520
river from many work to the automation

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,400
and the third phase of the etch that is

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,560
an intelligent transformation like this

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,970
function mobile phone change to the

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,430
smart mobile phone so we say the network

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:09,570
after enabling infrastructure the

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:14,430
ecosystem has a have to drive out the

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:16,800
edge and the edge has imposed reinforce

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,380
between ecosystem and the network

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,400
development to address the milk alter

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,280
the transformation of the network insert

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:31,430
the Islanders or automation and

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,430
reviewing the person to repeat leisure

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:44,070
we are thinking inter-party cell

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:51,050
operation it is not looking at just our

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:55,050
opening this will be chilly light final

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:58,410
also try to view the network in our

00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:01,620
platform pattern we need to have the

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:05,060
significant changes from anxiety so

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:08,760
first user to open under certain layers

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:12,000
welcome to the center opening is that

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,220
making the platform use building more

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,330
and more complicated so we can start by

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,600
layer layer layer and mix and help

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:26,030
others to balance

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:29,360
ability and the complexity and you ever

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:32,180
needed a digital trail to have research

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,580
that networks are open we also need to

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,150
the models and the disparities still

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,940
beaut a total under introducer the

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,190
intelligent and the layer by layer

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,260
governance and the we also need to

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:49,610
simplify the architecture of the

00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:51,650
multi-dimensional Network and with the

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,190
modification of the platform and the

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:57,800
changes architecture the network can be

00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:01,190
the foundation of their industry

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:04,220
education and the present that is our

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:07,910
fourth the apparent ISM ginge over the

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,820
edge here are several points the first

00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:17,060
is the larger they act need to be open

00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:19,640
and family in the free application and

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,790
second is of the concerning power like a

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:26,530
big variation and arranger and also the

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:30,080
computing so it needs to work on the

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:32,690
actual architecture computing power and

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,660
the third is to look at the different

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,539
scenarios and have the heart and self

00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,349
management and love formally

00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:43,010
differentiate into the industry

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:45,290
application under the computing need to

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,030
be coordinated with the network the

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,760
network and the edge we need to work

00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:52,100
together and to realize their the

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,500
production and adduction to the deep

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,340
relative industries and to healthy

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,900
intelligent allocation of the ricotta

00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:03,230
genetic connection and the computing

00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:07,880
will be receptor for the earth building

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:10,730
the ecosystem is about their public

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:15,200
parrot develop or develop and check

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:21,920
those out as an ecosystem in larger

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:23,420
scale and expansion and we protrude and

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,740
also do

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:30,140
a very important person we need the

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,680
active development of API and attractor

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:37,280
about to work and value creation and

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,940
second is that the automated our test

00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,340
and the commercialization integration

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,370
and the third is there to build a shared

00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,810
application market community acceptance

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:52,700
of ways of the monetization of the value

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:55,850
enjoyable field so these three will work

00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,660
together and build a set echo and values

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,250
excel we note that the digital

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,160
development of industry will need looser

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,490
other ICT and the hope typically viewed

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,410
research network and how to identify the

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,550
standard so we know data under different

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:15,950
layers here at the rental open project

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:20,060
all the other system which I have the

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:22,700
open B education to build their shared

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,310
app store and also we can have to order

00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,590
to view to the open automation platform

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,020
and have their elf edge to have both of

00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:34,070
the edge conclusions

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:36,770
stack of the technology the open is open

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,500
source either at the current level and

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,720
it represented the highest level of

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:46,340
their technology the architecture and

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:49,600
also all these relatives can help with

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:54,290
the building over the harmonizer

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,480
physical engineering challenge the

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:59,290
leader standard we can improve the

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,660
efficiency of the operators the

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,820
manufacturers and Industry Development

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:09,570
and while we have been actively working

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:13,110
on the limit

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:16,529
thank you concluding development and

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:20,310
like the open be the owner and the edge

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:23,820
and also the acronym so I participated

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,259
in this work I am really all all the

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,670
achievements that we often thought

00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:32,790
without it we have nothing but always a

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:38,040
friend on the sketch and this was the

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:40,410
owner is the first Chinese ability to

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,190
owner and you can get editor another

00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:47,790
booth with somebody here is a

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:50,779
participation on the development in the

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:54,060
works in the open source community I

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:57,449
also have my own observations that want

00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:00,389
them to share with you the open and the

00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:02,100
others is not just an attitude is the

00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:04,769
things the omniverse of ability and

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,190
often an open source it is not just a

00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:10,110
new strategy for the development it is

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,480
related to the strategy and industrial

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,000
development and in the future for the to

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,180
be and to see family will be realized

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,569
that anger to be over to up and to

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,699
follow the most efficient way to realize

00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:25,440
that a consensus in the technology that

00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,449
it's very important of all of the

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,750
resistant about development and they see

00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:32,910
sir digital technology I believe that

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,860
the opportunity to work together with

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,800
the traditional industry to build early

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,480
hominin sir an open platform and enable

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,949
the digitization of the different

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,139
technology so there will be a point of

00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:48,630
reading so whichever in current and

00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,760
value promotion and network with the

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,800
platform to do the automatic driving

00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,689
networks and the search eserve the

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,620
connection and a compute with their

00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:58,050
intelligence

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,880
improved and also there are new

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,740
preparation that is open source in the

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,980
standard to beautification work pattern

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,600
libraries

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:12,120
picture now the new world either in

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,860
front of us the industry of digitization

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,590
has are more and more possibilities

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,310
the world will be chanted by the network

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,310
