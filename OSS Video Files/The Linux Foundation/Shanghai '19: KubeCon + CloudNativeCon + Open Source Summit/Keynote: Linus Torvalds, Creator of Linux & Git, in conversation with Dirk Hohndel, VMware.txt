Nihao Oh Jo Dirk and I will stop trying

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:11,490
to speak Chinese now and I won't even

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:14,040
start so it's a huge pleasure to be here

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,590
linens and I get to go to a lot of

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,230
conferences and and this is one that I

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,789
really enjoy a lot coming to China I

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,920
think this is your first time in

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,710
Shanghai this is my first time in

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,930
Shanghai third time in China I think for

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,060
me it's more like the 20th time in China

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,710
and I don't even know how many times I

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,300
think most of the times I get to go to

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,950
Shanghai so it's wonderful to be back

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,110
for me this format of having a

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,469
conversation with leanness on stage is

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,840
something that grew out of a necessity

00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:48,840
originally because leanness does not

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,960
like presentation I don't think anybody

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,090
really likes doing presentations I do

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,649
not like doing to prepare talks

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,559
especially when I don't know the

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,960
audience that well so what happens is I

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,329
feel stressed out by the situation and

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,210
now I have somebody to blame when he

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,220
asks me questions and if they're not

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,670
relevant to you it's not my fault

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:16,229
anymore so basically if this session is

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,860
good it's Lena's result if it's bad it's

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,869
my fault

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,299
so let's start with something really

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,970
easy the state of linux you just

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:29,869
released 5.2 rc6

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:34,079
where are we so I'd say Linux and last

00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:37,110
it's almost 15 years we've had a very

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,329
good model for doing development it took

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:46,350
us it took us a decade to really figure

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:48,600
out how to do things but these days we

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,850
don't worry about individual features

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,600
anymore particularly not me I worry

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,939
about the process of getting those

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,259
features out and making releases and

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:05,369
that really hasn't changed I don't know

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,860
how to really explain that to you it's

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,819
one of those things where if you get

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,530
smart people together

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:17,260
and you motivate them with a common goal

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,180
good things happen and that is really

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,629
that's the only way I can explain it

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,870
because we don't I don't even have a

00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:30,730
5-year plan I don't have a plan that

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:34,180
spans more than roughly six months I

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:37,719
want to make sure that we have a smooth

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:41,620
road and then we have a every release we

00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:45,489
have about 1,500 people that all work on

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,930
their own individual parts and maybe a

00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,239
hundred people who end up being

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,030
maintained errs who take those parts

00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,639
together and then send them on to me and

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,819
I make a new release roughly every three

00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,340
months but so rc6 the latest release

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,620
last weekend was pretty big which is

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,049
unusually that's late in the Indus

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,709
ichael how come so we usually hope that

00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:11,049
all the major work gets done during the

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,060
or get gets integrated during the

00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:18,009
two-week merge window and then we have

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:20,769
usually six or seven weeks of release

00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:22,060
maintenance and fixing bugs and just

00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,659
making sure everything works

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:30,120
and sadly reality does not always work

00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:33,280
with our schedule and we end up having

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,919
security issues sometimes that just have

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,689
deadlines that come at the end of a

00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,959
release schedule which is very painful

00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:43,060
for us we also end up sometimes just

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,319
being unlucky and having people find

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:52,299
some new issue that doesn't really mesh

00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:54,519
with our timing and it's it's something

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:58,239
we learn to deal with it's not a big

00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,609
deal anymore right now we're in the is

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,549
we're supposed to be in the latter part

00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:05,439
of the calming down period and yes last

00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,989
week was actually much more painful than

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,840
it should have been but at the same time

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:13,239
this is something that over the last 15

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,769
years we've learned to deal with so it's

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,019
not something that makes me worry it

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,049
it's just that oh well it happened again

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,120
but so we are still on track for a 5/32

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,980
release into three weeks we have been

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,510
very consistent

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,490
in hitting usually rc7 tends to be the

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,550
last release candidate and then I do I

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,930
release the week after it actually looks

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,620
like we're on track for that right now

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,600
the most likely cause of maybe delaying

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,060
a week and set being whether I have

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,160
internet access Nick's over the next

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,710
seven days or not and that might

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,530
actually shift things by a week but but

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,110
it actually has been very consistent and

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,270
I think we are on track now to so how

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,810
much do people outside of the core Linux

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:01,150
community still care about the intricate

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,850
details of how we develop Linux has this

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:08,260
plateaued is it declining it's still

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:10,720
growing but we have means it's maybe not

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,890
growing at quite the same speed it used

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,590
to be and I don't think people outside

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,330
the Lynx kernel community should

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:22,240
necessarily care what they really should

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:26,620
care about is how consistent we have

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,530
been and what most users of the kernel

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,980
should care about is that they can feel

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:36,010
confident in moving to a new kernel and

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,560
knowing that there's a lot of people who

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,440
spend a lot of time making sure but when

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,490
you move to a new kernel your processes

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,160
will not break and then there are the

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,190
other people the people like me how many

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,080
kernel developers are in the audience

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:57,220
there's probably not this one

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,560
oh there's one there that's okay

00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,380
there I'm sure there are others with the

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,350
lights I can't see kernel people are

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,820
strange people sometimes you need to

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:11,350
have a certain kind of detail orientated

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,170
person who really wants to know exactly

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:17,800
how the machine works and really wants

00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,620
to control every single detail of that

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,690
piece of hardware in front of you and

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,210
it's a rare breed but one of the things

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,730
about being on the Internet is even if

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:31,750
you rare breed and you have a very

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:34,270
specific interest when there are three

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,760
billion people with internet access in

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,010
the world even a

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,290
rare read ends up being many thousands

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:45,250
of people and and that's I think the

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:48,070
real strength of open source and the

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,530
Internet is that it allows us to to get

00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,420
all those strange people who like

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,120
tinkering with Hardware together and

00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,340
make a product but it's interesting what

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,190
you say so this idea of engineering

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,450
excellence of truly understanding the

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,770
details of the code versus what I

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,380
somewhat derogatory we call

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,630
click-and-drag programming of people

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,910
just throwing together big blocks not

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,280
knowing what they do isn't isn't there

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,210
danger in that shouldn't we want to

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,240
understand the code that we actually run

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:25,150
I think that was a derogatory remark

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,070
towards the click-and-drag people people

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,410
are different right and I'll be very

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:33,250
upfront I don't understand all of the

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,990
kernel either the kernel is roughly

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,590
thirty million lines of code or

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:41,940
something like that and honestly no

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:46,030
single person understands every line

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:49,800
this is why we all specialize and some

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:52,480
specialize in maintaining kernel code

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,930
others specialize in doing you eyes I

00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,780
cannot do a user interface to save my

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,160
life and that's okay and again this is

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,500
one of the things that open-source

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,940
allows you to do is we all have things

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,890
we're interested in whether they are

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,020
making pretty interfaces or whether they

00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:14,410
are tinkering with the small details of

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:18,340
the hardware and and I don't think

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,770
there's a us-versus-them right although

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,760
sometimes we do end up having fights

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,560
about how things should be done we do so

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,440
that you mentioned security is one of

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,440
the big things in rc6 with fixes for the

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,700
s act problem but if I look bigger

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,229
picture at the the IT infrastructure

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,140
where where is the major focus for

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:45,700
security is it the kernel is it in user

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,440
space where do we need to focus so I I'm

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,230
of the opinion that when it comes to

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,270
security you should not focus

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,220
because it's everywhere I mean over the

00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,920
last two years in particular we've seen

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,290
in Colonel and very painfully how

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,860
sometimes the focus is not on suffer at

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:06,040
all it's on the hardware and and the way

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,490
to have a secure system is not to even

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,670
believe that you have one entirely

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:15,610
impenetrable wall between you and this

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:18,670
evil world you need to have secure

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,589
hardware you need to have secure kernels

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,410
you need to have secure libraries you

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:26,320
need to have secure software at every

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,150
stage because everybody makes mistakes

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,830
whether you're making hardware whether

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,620
we are making operating systems whether

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:37,000
you're making applications there will be

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:39,850
bugs and the true path to security is to

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,320
have multiple layers of security where

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:46,120
even if one layer gets compromised we

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,020
then have another layer that picks up

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:53,050
that that problem and so in the kernel

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,240
we obviously take we end up being some

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,850
of the more security conscious projects

00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,880
because if the kernel has a security

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,220
problem it's a problem for everybody so

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,010
we do take in maybe more seriously than

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,320
some other projects but I do think that

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,330
everybody needs to always keep security

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,940
in mind regardless of what you do

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:15,190
you mentioned hardware and the surprises

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,779
that Hardware maybe isn't as secure the

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,730
other thing that has happened in the

00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,370
last few years is that we've clearly

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,320
seen the end of Moore's law we've seen

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,200
the end of the doubling of performance

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,839
every 18 months and so you have always

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,670
been very performance conscious in the

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,980
way you you look at software and the way

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,650
you develop the Linux kernel is this

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,540
something that will be more important up

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,430
and down the stack in the future in

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,860
order to be able to write more complex

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,510
software in a stagnating performance

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,430
environment so I think it's going to be

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,990
interesting I've been saying this for

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,540
the last five years already that I

00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,120
actually think that when hardware

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,630
performance stagnates that's going to

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,390
put pressure on a lot of software people

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,720
to improve in performance in ways they

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:04,199
have not had pressure before

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:08,430
and and I it hasn't maybe quite hit a

00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:10,259
wall yet but I do think that it's going

00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:14,069
to be very healthy for the software

00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:16,470
ecosystem to no longer be able to depend

00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:20,519
on Hardware improving and hardware is

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:22,259
not just CPUs it's obviously every piece

00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:28,680
of the hardware spectrum including

00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:31,259
networking and i/o and for a project

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,839
like the kernel where performance is

00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,839
always being one of the primary goals I

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,399
don't think will be taken by surprise

00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,589
but I suspect some some other projects

00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,660
may have gotten a bit used to the fact

00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:48,240
that they can keep drawing their code

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,550
every year and the hardware will improve

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,199
to to the point where nobody cares I

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,610
think it's going to be interesting I

00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,009
think it's going to be a shock to some

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,660
projects other learnings from the kernel

00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,970
that these other projects I mean

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,389
kubernetes the whole cloud native world

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,670
can can take from the kernel I'm not

00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,250
sure how much the kernel development

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:12,779
model really translates to other

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:15,120
projects we've had a somewhat different

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:16,829
approach to maintenance that a lot of

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,519
other projects have had and we've had a

00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:25,559
more unified picture of where we want to

00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:29,879
go maybe than some other projects one of

00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:33,120
the things I would like to be a teaching

00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,410
moment for other projects actually two

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,800
things

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:40,980
one is don't break your users this has

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,980
been a mantra for the kernel for a long

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,720
long time and it's something that a lot

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,019
of other projects seem to not have

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:53,189
learned in order for a project to really

00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:57,360
flourish in the long term you want to

00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:59,160
not have your users worry about upgrades

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,610
and worry about new versions and you

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:05,309
want to make them aware of the fact that

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,860
you are a stable platform and that's

00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:09,380
true whatever you do but so many

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,960
projects forget about

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:19,430
and the other kind of important message

00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:23,840
I will have is kubernetes is a fairly

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:26,180
young project we've been doing the

00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,420
kernel Nile for I've been doing it for

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:33,320
28 years I know something that audience

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:38,030
has been doing it for more than 20 in

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:41,390
order to have that kind of long life you

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:46,580
really want to create a community and

00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:49,490
have a kind of common culture not

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:52,520
necessarily a language because people

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:57,680
work together even across language

00:13:52,520 --> 00:14:00,680
barriers but having a a common goal is

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,070
important in order to work together for

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,050
a long term and it's the goal cannot be

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,890
something very specific because that

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:12,320
goal needs to change so what we in the

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:16,850
kernel community kind of have is a

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:20,720
culture of not what we aim for but what

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:24,230
kind of things we aim for so those two

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,760
things I would like to spread further

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,210
outside the kernel because that's

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,400
something I've seen other projects have

00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,490
issues with I want to shift gears a

00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:37,730
little bit and talk to you about a mod

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,820
generic question so if you if you look

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:43,430
across the different domains so

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,520
enterprise embedded desktop in the work

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:49,760
world consumers gaming what do you think

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:52,330
are the important the relative relevant

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,280
platforms from hardware perspective and

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,890
OSS from a software perspective so where

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,780
is Jim said wherever Linux goes Linux

00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:05,060
wins I think it's a little more

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:07,820
differentiated than that can you

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,890
rephrase that question absolutely so

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,500
when you look at when you look at say

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:15,350
the enterprise space we've seen Linux

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,080
and x86 was was the huge leader right

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,270
when you look at something like the

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,860
desktop especially consumers and gaming

00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,110
I think it's other platform

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,940
and other OSS who are leading and I

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:30,920
wanted to get a feeling where you think

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:32,570
this is going so the reason why I maybe

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,610
have problems with that question is

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,430
that's not the kind of question I end up

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:44,720
that's not the kind of question I worry

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:48,260
about when I think about Linux and where

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:53,740
I want Linux to go I worry about the

00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,740
technology I don't care so much about

00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:01,970
what the market is and who is going to

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:05,269
win I'm not in it for winning I'm in it

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:07,430
to do the best technology I can and I

00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:10,610
think that if you do the best technology

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:14,720
you often will do well right you will

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:17,810
not always win we've seen that in a lot

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,079
of areas of technology being first is

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,000
more important than being best because

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:26,660
if you get a huge community around

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,920
yourself you have already won but at the

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:33,050
same time I don't care so when when you

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,870
asked me that question I'm like that is

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:39,170
not relevant to what I want to do in in

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:42,140
my world what I want to do is regardless

00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:45,980
of the platform we'll do the best we can

00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,370
and I think most of the time it means we

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,350
win

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,649
and I guess there was the answer I was

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:55,610
looking for but you are a gamer you like

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:58,570
me are games I'm not a gamer trust me on

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,440
this one you don't want me see me gaming

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:04,220
unfortunately I don't have a video to

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,380
show that but is that something where

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,780
it's a platform you think open source is

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,380
going to be relevant I think it is

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,540
actually I mean if you look at one of

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,689
the big things about open source is you

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:20,329
can do new and exciting things and what

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:24,949
Dirk is alluding to when he says a gamer

00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:27,110
I'm a fat person and what I've tried to

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:27,980
do for the last couple of months to kind

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,230
of

00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,630
not be asked that I played a game called

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,990
beat Sabre I don't know if anybody here

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:40,790
knows about it where you just swing your

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:42,919
arms around in rhythm game and I've

00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:47,720
actually been doing it also on an oculus

00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:49,610
quest and it's a self sufficient VR

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,250
environment and it has is actually

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,320
running Linux and the reason it's

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:59,559
running Linux is when you do a new

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:04,370
technology you care about your goals and

00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:06,290
you want to take as much existing

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:09,770
infrastructure as possible to make it

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,840
easy to get to your goals and Linux has

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,929
obviously been a huge part of that in

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,570
almost every setting so the only places

00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:20,630
where Linux isn't completely taking over

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:23,630
tends to be places where there was a

00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:26,419
very strong established market already

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:29,240
and you had an established code base if

00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:33,230
you do something new and exciting and

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:36,669
interesting you will almost inevitably

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:40,130
use Linux as the base and that includes

00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:41,390
new platforms for gaming and that was

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,210
really where I was trying to go with

00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:46,790
this because in so many of these spaces

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:51,080
there are perceived established

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:53,360
proprietary winners that you assume will

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,840
just continue to rule the world if you

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,270
had asked someone in 2002 who would be

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,669
the smartphone platform number one they

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,230
would have said Windows Mobile and and

00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:06,620
maybe that didn't work out quite that

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,510
well so one of the things I always try

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:11,059
to do is always try to make you make

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,980
predictions about the future it I know

00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,750
your favorite thing you already had your

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,850
bed saying you never look more than six

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:21,530
months into the future so I'll make it

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:23,900
easy for you 2021 thirty years of Linux

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,790
it'll be a big party I'm looking forward

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,570
to it I hope it will be somewhere where

00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:32,330
we can dice Jim if you're listening what

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,820
do we expect for Linux for the second

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,419
thirty years will it continue just as

00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:40,059
today or

00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:41,890
where do you think we're going so I

00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:45,520
actually don't think technology moves

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:48,780
that rapidly I mean if you realistically

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,669
if you look at what Linux does today

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:57,100
it's not that different from what

00:19:51,669 --> 00:20:00,640
operating systems did 50 years ago 60

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:02,320
years ago what has changed is the

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,690
hardware the hardware has changed

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,179
enormously the use has changed

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,909
enormously Linux is right in between

00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:13,960
those two things what an operating

00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:17,169
system fundamentally does is it acts as

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:22,210
a resource manager and as the interface

00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:24,490
between suffer and Hardware and I don't

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:27,370
know what suffer and Hardware will look

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,590
like in 30 years but I do know we'll

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,679
still have an operating system that acts

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:36,100
as that resource manager and interface

00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,830
between suffer and hardware and I do

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,530
believe it will probably be called Linux

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:44,980
right because that's one of the other

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:48,780
things about open source once once you

00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:52,419
have this incredible platform this base

00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,400
why would you then go and try to rewrite

00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:59,559
everything when you already have access

00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:02,440
to it I may not be around in 30 years I

00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,360
will be around in 2021 for the 30 year

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,960
anniversary and here was hoping to

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,179
invite you to the reunion in 2051 to

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,100
talk about 60 years of Linux we're out

00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:13,250
of time thank you very much I hope this

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,750
was fun

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,750
