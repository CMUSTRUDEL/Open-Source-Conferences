right good morning as people come in we

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:13,320
will start this second round of keynotes

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:20,070
with a very interesting twist which is

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:23,100
how does cloud native impact adjacent

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,320
areas and Technology so that's the focus

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,840
of this whole section of keynotes

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,050
and you will understand and appreciate

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,480
how different open-source projects

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,320
within a the Linux Foundation are

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,170
working together to enable this

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,950
phenomenon what I'm going to talk about

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:47,850
today are three things and I call it the

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:53,750
new world of open source networking edge

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:56,750
and IOT and this new world has three

00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,750
characteristics

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:05,760
the first one is telecom networks

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:10,080
globally have now chosen open source to

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:16,320
be their de facto platform that's number

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:22,790
one number two the cloud is moving to

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:26,820
the edge an edge is going to be unified

00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:32,130
across not just a cloud but cloud

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:35,100
networks telecom enterprise and IOT it's

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,909
going to be a common edge so we'll talk

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,600
about that built on open source and

00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:45,530
number three there are inter

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,329
dependencies between projects across

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,390
cloud native and other technologies so

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:54,030
I'm going to cover all three let me

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,700
start off with the telecom networking

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,090
part open source is going to be the de

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,460
facto way how global networks are built

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,869
why do we know that the journey started

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,390
with Sdn and NFV

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,349
several years ago I was one of the first

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,849
ones in that journey that journey led to

00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:13,349
disaggregation where you had a choice of

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,010
hardware and software

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:21,749
it moved to automation and orchestration

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:24,389
of the entire network zero touch last

00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:26,489
year and then this year is about open

00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:29,700
collaboration with the cloud native and

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:32,790
containerization and to help with this

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,799
journey Lenox foundation Lenox

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,579
foundation networking specifically is

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:42,810
very proud to host nine of the top ten

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:44,549
projects top ten open source projects we

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,829
have operators and end-users

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,680
participating that account for almost

00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:53,310
70% of the global mobile subscribers

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,739
including the top three from China here

00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:01,230
top China Mobile Chan Telecom China

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:03,810
Unicom and all the vendors that are in

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,689
networking right so this is just the

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,230
board of elif networking but huge

00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:13,919
momentum here and that momentum has been

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:16,319
recognized through deployments open

00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,049
source is deployed in some of the

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,750
largest carriers and specifically

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:24,269
projects like own app that Jim talked

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,889
about open network automation platform

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,370
which was created through the

00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:30,659
collaboration of China Mobile an AT&T a

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,720
couple of years ago and now is the de

00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,729
facto platform right geo real and geo

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,329
the fastest growing LTE network in in

00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:41,370
India is using at AT&T China Mobile Bell

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,849
Canada Orange you know you name it

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,979
there's this huge focus on deployment

00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:54,209
and the thing that I personally like is

00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:58,009
the how open source is developed and I

00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:01,139
call it diversity across people

00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:02,900
communities geographies and companies so

00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,879
you can see some of the panels we had a

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:10,019
all-female panel keynote panel these are

00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:13,949
technical leaders in the onap community

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:17,870
right they own the TSC we had meetups

00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:20,729
including last year here in Shanghai so

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,279
and then on the right hand side you can

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:26,190
see from the colors that various

00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,340
companies are contributing from the

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,550
first release

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,740
the releases afterwards so it's very

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:37,030
important from a diversity perspective

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,830
and the focus areas on networking for

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,820
this year in terms of open source are

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:44,710
two things one is compliance and

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,780
verification and the other one is

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,210
standards and open source harmonization

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:54,220
so let me take two minutes to explain

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:56,440
those in the world of telcos if you're a

00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,310
China Mobile China Telecom China Unicom

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,530
or anyone in in the world the thing on

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,440
the left is what you have to deal with

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:08,680
you get a vnf or a virtual network

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,070
function or a workload or an app right

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,260
load balancers firewalls you've all pick

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,210
packet for you get that from one vendor

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,070
you get the orchestrator from another

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,720
vendor you get the virtual

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,150
infrastructure manager from another

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,919
vendor and you get the hardware and NFB

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,940
i that we call it from another one and

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:31,539
then you have to onboard and test what

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,789
LF network Kings OBP program that just

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:37,000
got launched will do is simplify the

00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:39,880
whole lifecycle by 50% gate will be

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,520
based on own app and open Fe and we are

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,400
working with GSMA to help this

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,390
standardized NFB i huge huge progress in

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,910
the community to simplify deployment the

00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,950
second important thing we are doing in

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,139
networking is to make sure that

00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:59,139
standards and open-source work

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,450
collaboratively we have white papers

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:05,860
that are just refreshed that explain how

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:08,500
the communities work and we are now the

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,350
showcase for standards and open source

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:17,260
collaboration whether it's math TMF form

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:22,060
or an etsy GSMA we are the standard and

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:24,220
we work with them very very closely now

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,110
that's the core networking which is now

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,780
automated and it is needs to be

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,180
automated before 5g hits now let's move

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,820
to the edge when we move to the edge

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,589
today you have a fragmented edge you

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,539
have a cloud edge you have an IOT edge

00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:41,689
you have an enterprise edge and now you

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:44,089
have a telco edge we believe that there

00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:47,329
needs to be a unified edge and so we

00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:50,929
announced in 2019 an umbrella project

00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:54,489
called LF edge which is hugely supported

00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:57,379
by by you folks here in China that

00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:59,869
unifies the different edge communities

00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:02,479
it was found by five founding members

00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:04,099
founding projects and 60 founding

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,739
members now today we're up to seven

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,589
including Baidu's OpenEdge which is

00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:11,779
going to be contributed into LF edge

00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:14,659
we're at 70 plus now and we are working

00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:17,349
very closely with a lot of standardized

00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:21,049
community so this is how you know edge

00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:22,789
looks at the landscape so you can see

00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:25,789
from the top you got to collaborate with

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:29,749
Oran then you have a project in-home

00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:32,899
edge which is the software that unifies

00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:36,559
the appliances inside the edge then you

00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:38,719
have Eve which is the on-prem edge comes

00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:40,639
into an acronym blueprint which is

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:42,979
another project that glues everything

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,529
together and then moves into the core

00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:46,219
running own app own app works with

00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:48,979
kubernetes

00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:52,129
and OpenStack and then works with all

00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:56,719
the standards looks complex but it is

00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:58,759
very very nicely laid out okay and so

00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:01,519
that brings me to my third and very

00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,189
important point which is we're not

00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,159
living in the world of isolation cloud

00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:10,909
native is not on its own networking is

00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:13,399
not on its own edge blockchain cloud

00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:16,579
foundry these are all platforms that are

00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:17,839
collaborating and it's very important so

00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:21,829
I'm going to give you a few examples

00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,599
here the first one is Aleph networking

00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:27,939
is working very closely with kubernetes

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:34,459
to figure out how we can do a hybrid

00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:36,860
migration of VMs or vnf to CNS okay and

00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:39,800
see NFS are cloud native functions they

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,529
have a very specific characteristics and

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,410
we want to move them along how does that

00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:47,670
happen we have test beds we have own app

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,350
working groups that collaborate and

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:54,000
we'll come up with a solution for that

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:55,920
okay later on today we will have Brian

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,710
talked about you know blockchain and

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,800
this technology is extremely relevant to

00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,600
telecom and we have the telecom sig that

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,970
will work closely with the aleph

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,980
networking so these are just in here the

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,980
use cases so these are just examples of

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,790
projects and umbrellas working together

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,960
to collaborate and make things happen

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:22,130
and we make things happen the stack

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,840
looks very simple at the end of the day

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,120
end-users make money from these services

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,480
cloud services residential services

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,580
enterprises services or IOT ai services

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,280
and they run those services on

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,510
infrastructure data centers carrier

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,460
networks cloud networks and public or

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,850
hybrid or private doesn't matter and

00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:48,660
then the layer in the middle is the

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:51,090
plumbing that's the glue that needs to

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,820
be automated and that's the project

00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:58,800
focus for LF networking and the edge

00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:01,650
kubernetes l FAI LF edge okay so that's

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,290
kind of the whole picture so from my

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,750
perspective the key takeaways for this

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:10,500
year in 2019 this is the year of

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:15,090
collaboration okay and in telecom

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:18,390
networks open source has one there's no

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:21,570
more proprietary deployments all the way

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,280
to ran however there's a lot of

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,600
innovation on top of the open source

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,000
plumbing as I call it

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,800
but own app as the Chosin de facto

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,800
platform the edge is completely

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,800
fragmented this year but we are bringing

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,800
a unified edge together across IOT
