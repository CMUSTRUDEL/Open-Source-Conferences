	Lightning Talk: How We Use Istio and OPA for Authorization - Lin Tao, HP 

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 â€“ April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

I'd like to introduce how we use istio + OPA to do authorization in HP's FitStation platform.    Our project consists of 20+ micro-services which are written in Golang and running on Kubernetes with istio enabled. These services are divided into multiple layers and on each layer we apply different authorization via istio mixer and OPA.    I'd like to give a high-level introduction on how we make this work, following topics will be covered:  - how we leverage istio adapter to do authorization  - how we integrate OPA into our micro-services  - how we manage our OPA policies
