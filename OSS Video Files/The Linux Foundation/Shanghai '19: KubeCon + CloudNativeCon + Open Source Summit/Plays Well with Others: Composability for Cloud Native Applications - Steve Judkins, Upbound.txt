	Plays Well with Others: Composability for Cloud Native Applications - Steve Judkins, Upbound 

Writing cloud native applications today involves custom code to stitch everything together across microservices, open-source frameworks, and managed services. In this talk, we look beyond Kubernetesâ€™ usage for container orchestration and extend the Kubernetes API to the management of external resources (not running on pods or nodes). Imagine if an application developer writing a monitoring framework could ask for a SQL database and message queue for their application in the same way that the Kubernetes API enables them to ask for an abstract PersistentVolumeClaim backed by a concrete PersistentVolume implementation. We can imagine that this developer might also expose the monitoring framework as a resource for consumption by other applications. In this talk we explore the use of this new approach to facilitate composability and reuse of resources within heterogeneous applications.
