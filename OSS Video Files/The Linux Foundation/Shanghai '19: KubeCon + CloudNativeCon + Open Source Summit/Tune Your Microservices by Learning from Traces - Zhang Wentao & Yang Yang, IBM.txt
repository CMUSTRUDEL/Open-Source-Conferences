	Tune Your Microservices by Learning from Traces - Zhang Wentao & Yang Yang, IBM 

Tracing plays a more and more important role in the world of microservices, to help with trouble shooting and bottle neck analysis. But within huge amount of traces generated everyday, what can we learn from them, and make full use of these valuable amount of data? In this session, we will discuss how to use Kubeflow to train tracing data generated by Istio, to reveal the patterns you may never discovered by naked eyes, like seasonality performance downgrade, biggest influencer of system failure, correlation between microservices, etc.. It will help with root cause analysis, and eventually tune your microservices with optimized performance.Â
