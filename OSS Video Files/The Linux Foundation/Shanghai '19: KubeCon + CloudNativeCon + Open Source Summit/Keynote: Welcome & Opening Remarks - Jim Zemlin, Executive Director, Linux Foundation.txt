welcome to coop con cloud native con

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,620
open-source summit China

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,179
thanks for being here we're really happy

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:17,130
to see everyone today I want to just get

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:20,310
us started by reminding all of you how

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,519
important open-source is to the

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:28,470
technology industry I have been coming

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,480
to China for almost 20 years

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,600
many times to see my very good friend

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,290
professor Liu from Kopu is right here in

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,890
the front row but also to spend a lot of

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,280
time with Chinese developers Chinese

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,489
organizations and every time I'm so

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,280
impressed by the innovation that comes

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,579
from China and the way that innovation

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:59,070
gets taken into the global open source

00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:02,640
community you know open source is really

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,960
one of the most effective enablers of

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,080
innovation in the history of technology

00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:13,200
now how do I know that because I have

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,790
been lucky enough to be working at the

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,380
Linux Foundation for most of my career

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:22,830
and witness to how powerful open-source

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,430
software has become and how open-source

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:30,479
now is the majority of software in

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,630
almost every major technology product or

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,049
service and even though we're here in

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:41,520
China what's interesting is open-source

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:44,820
software can come from anywhere it can

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,820
come from a dorm room in Finland leanest

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,970
Torvalds began working on Linux when he

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,549
was still in college in Finland it can

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,880
come from a university in the United

00:01:53,549 --> 00:02:00,149
States the Apache web server was created

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,409
from an offshoot of project in the

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,380
University of Illinois in the United

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,520
States but it can also come from the

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,979
world one of the world's biggest

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,849
telecommunications companies in this

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:14,359
case our own app project

00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:17,810
which is based on code from open Oh a

00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:22,359
project created at China mobile here in

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:26,049
China and it doesn't matter where it

00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:30,139
starts what's interesting is that

00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:34,400
instantly everyone can have access to it

00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:37,060
because the internet enables instant

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,480
distribution of this source code and

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,709
what's even better is anyone can

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:49,340
participate whether it's Linux Apache

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:52,489
own app Cloud Foundry kubernetes you

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,889
name it anyone can jump in and start

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:57,500
contributing code and participating in

00:02:54,889 --> 00:03:01,659
these communities or come to events like

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:05,299
this and here's the most important part

00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:09,280
everyone benefits from this open source

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:13,219
software everyone benefits

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,799
competitors benefit each other everyone

00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:21,349
shares in the innovation that comes from

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:25,849
it this is a global movement that works

00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:29,090
and it works incredibly well and if you

00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:33,739
don't believe me I brought some people

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:36,189
with me this week who have been in open

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:38,720
source from the very very early days

00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:41,209
today we have leanest Torvalds here

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,930
who's been working in open source for 27

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,049
years

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,449
ah brian behlendorf one of the lead

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,069
creators of the apache web server a

00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:52,909
founder of the apache software

00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:55,819
foundation is here this week dan Kahn

00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:56,989
who did the first commercial transaction

00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,120
on the Internet

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,040
first secure commercial transaction on

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,469
the Internet runs the cloud native

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,169
computing foundation one of the hosts of

00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:07,939
this week's events and the whole Linux

00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:09,739
Foundation team is here as well

00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:12,439
Abbie Kearns from the Cloud Foundry

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,599
foundation Arpit Joshi poro from our

00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,359
networking group and many many more be

00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,719
sure to seek these folks out meet them

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,190
and talk about how open-source can work

00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:26,270
for you your come

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:30,590
and everyone around you you see I know

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:34,010
open source works because Linux has

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,400
become the most important widely

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:42,280
distributed software in the world Linux

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:45,620
is the best example of how open-source

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,010
eventually comes to dominate almost

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,900
every form of computing the

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,790
supercomputer market all the way to

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,890
Internet clients mobile handsets

00:04:52,790 --> 00:05:02,000
enterprise service Linux is everywhere

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:05,900
now it's not just Linux one of the best

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,810
parts about my job is I've been able to

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:14,270
witness to huge transformations in

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:17,000
technology through open source the first

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:22,090
one is clearly Linux it's an incredible

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,330
project the second one is newer and it's

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:31,610
kubernetes in the cloud native computing

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:36,669
movement cloud native computing is a

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:41,990
huge change in the way software gets

00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:45,260
created deployed and managed the cloud

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:48,950
native computing movement isn't that old

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,110
in internet or technology terms leanness

00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,570
has been working on Linux for 27 years

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,940
cloud native computing and the cloud

00:05:53,570 --> 00:06:00,220
native computing foundation was founded

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:04,400
in 2015 just four years ago and it has

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,610
spawned one of the most successful

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,430
projects in the history of open-source

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:14,030
kubernetes but not just kubernetes all

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:16,700
these other projects there are important

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,970
components of building managing and

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:23,000
deploying cloud native applications are

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,060
now a part of the cloud native computing

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,850
foundation and being worked on by people

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,360
and organizations from all over the

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,090
world

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,189
you can see all of the different

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,560
platinum members of the cloud native

00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:39,349
computing foundation just recently we

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,960
had companies like GoDaddy Apple

00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:44,000
Computer just joined the cloud native

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,240
computing foundation at our highest

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,300
level as a Platinum Member but it's not

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:57,080
just these companies China itself people

00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:02,060
from China are the number two collective

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:05,719
contributors to kubernetes what an

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,900
amazing change what an amazing

00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:10,759
accomplishment

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,120
Chinese engagement with the cloud native

00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,909
computing foundation has been growing

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,610
year over year over year today

00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,620
10% of the cloud native computing found

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:25,099
member membership is from China

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,229
including 16% of the Platinum

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:30,529
memberships and 35% of the gold

00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:32,960
memberships the highest level 26% of the

00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:35,000
certified kubernetes vendors are from

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,610
here in China 19% of the service

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,330
providers 32% of our training partners

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:45,830
are here in China to think of it another

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:49,069
way look at this in 2015 just four years

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,539
ago there was one Chinese member of the

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:54,529
cloud native computing foundation wall

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:59,210
way Huawei LED but has been joined now

00:07:54,529 --> 00:08:01,969
by 37 other organizations and today I'm

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,190
very excited to announce a new member of

00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:05,659
the cloud native computing foundation

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,960
from here in China

00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:10,819
let's welcome aunt financial our newest

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,000
gold member of the cloud native

00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:19,250
computing foundation so how does this

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,849
work why is it that competitors can work

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:25,819
together through open source to create

00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:29,810
good outcomes I mean like what what's

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:32,329
left for competitive advantage you know

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:35,510
if everybody shares everything how can

00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:38,690
we compete that's the that's the major

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:41,810
question and let me show you how think

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,740
of it like a sandwich open source today

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,830
is

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,779
vast majority of all code so if you're

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,580
writing an application you might choose

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,550
a framework like nodejs

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,950
as an example write some custom code

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:58,149
this is the code that you need for your

00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:02,000
users or your customers and then you use

00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:04,399
NPM packages and common libraries to

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,690
create and solve problems and build your

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:12,140
app actual application the answer to the

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:16,220
question how can you use open-source

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:22,540
share most of your code 90% of your code

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:25,490
and compete the answer is that 10% that

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,640
code that you create for your users and

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:32,410
customers is really really really

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:36,560
important and if you had to create

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,870
everything else by yourself you wouldn't

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,790
be able to compete

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,700
that's why open-source is so important

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:47,390
to every single technology company or

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,940
user in the world and we see this at the

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,880
Linux Foundation over and over and over

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,029
again today the Lynx foundation works

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,100
across all forms of technology and

00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,589
computing we're the world's largest

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,160
certificate authority let's encrypt

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:06,079
issues millions of TLS certificates that

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,149
help improve security around the globe

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:14,779
in networking 80% of the world's mobile

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:17,750
subscribers you get access to the

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:20,029
networks that are using the Linux

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,360
foundation's networking projects things

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:24,560
like own app opendaylight and others

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,950
cloud computing we have obviously

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,399
kubernetes Cloud Foundry others in

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:33,320
automotive we're working with 12 of the

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,500
top automakers in the world to create

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,380
new automobile experiences new ways to

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,339
navigate new ways to experience being

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,950
inside of a car in blockchain our hyper

00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:48,380
ledger project is one of the fastest

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,560
growing enterprise implementations of

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:53,810
blockchain technology being used in the

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,700
financial services industry supply chain

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,670
industry in healthcare industry

00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,970
all over the world Europe the United

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,440
States and in China in edge and embedded

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,020
we have real-time operating system

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,270
projects and obviously in web we have

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:11,780
the nodejs

00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:15,140
project and many many more you see the

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:18,740
secret to why open-source works is

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:22,370
because we've created a positive

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:25,760
feedback loop a sustainable way for

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:29,450
people to share software benefit from it

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,000
and reinvest big open source projects

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:35,180
like kubernetes and Linux are used to

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,510
create products whether it's Alibaba

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,060
cloud huawei equipment whether it's

00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:44,330
something like the Baidu search platform

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,910
those run on Linux those products create

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,610
profits for those companies and then

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,520
those companies reinvest in the form of

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:55,280
engineers who they employ to work on

00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,040
open-source projects and the project

00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,660
gets better because those engineers take

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,870
the requirements they had for their

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:05,690
products improve the project that begets

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,420
better products that begets more profits

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:13,520
better projects more products more

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:18,050
profits it's a virtuous cycle today in

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:21,260
Linux 90% of the core kernel developers

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,510
are professionals that work in companies

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:28,220
here in China and the United States

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:30,770
Europe all over the world and I want to

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,590
give you an example of a project in a

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,380
very competitive industry that we just

00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:40,580
recently launched that I think all of

00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:44,390
you may be familiar with we worked with

00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:47,390
some of the most competitive movie

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:50,860
companies film companies in the world

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:56,680
who are now using open-source to create

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,680
really cool movies let's check it out

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:04,310
creative filmmakers today rely more than

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,830
ever on engineers and scientists using

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:10,430
open-source software to help craft

00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,960
fantastic visionary images every single

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,610
part of the filmmaking process is

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,130
touched by software and a lot of that

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,200
software is open-source software some of

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,630
the greatest innovations we've seen in

00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,580
the modern era of filmmaking have

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,220
actually been supported by open source

00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,260
software the Academy of Motion Picture

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,779
Arts and Sciences and the Linux

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,480
Foundation have created the Academy

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:34,910
Software Foundation with support from

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,040
industry leaders the Academy Software

00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,070
Foundation exists to provide a great

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,620
home for open source projects that we as

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,149
an industry use every day to projects

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,580
the Academy Software Foundation is

00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:51,260
currently working on our open VDB and

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:53,390
open color i/o open VDB is a volumetric

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,940
data block format it is pretty

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,510
ubiquitous in use anytime we have an

00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,760
explosion

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,500
it's BTB anytime you have clouds it's

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,900
EDB anywhere where you have a lot of

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,690
fluid simulation fireballs gas flowing

00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,600
across surface things that are big we

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,950
think there's value in having an

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,959
organization outside of DreamWorks take

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,760
responsibility for this and I think

00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,980
we've already seen a benefit in that

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,720
that we've had other Studios step

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,779
forward in a way they had not previously

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,339
with contributions to the standard open

00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:24,830
Clara is an open source color management

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:27,740
solution for motion picture production

00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,900
and and everyone working on a show from

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,670
an artist at a workstation to a director

00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,890
in a theater can see the same image and

00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,810
speak the same visual language open

00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,279
choreo is compatible with aces and can

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,770
be used to implement any well-defined

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,480
color standard highly critical projects

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,920
need oversight particularly for more

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,930
than one studio or company and can

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,970
benefit greatly from not only shared

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,010
development resources but also the solid

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,240
infrastructure offered by the Linux

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,610
Foundation and their involvement in the

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,860
academy software foundation whether you

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,630
are a user of open source software or an

00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,160
engineer or a company that relies on

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,140
open source software we want to create

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,220
the right ecosystem for you to get the

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,610
most out of the open source software

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,700
that you need to use find us that a SWF

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,630
dot IO and join the mailing list and see

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,200
how you can get involved

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,200
[Music]

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:18,980
pretty amazing that's right

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:22,700
open source is used to create the movies

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:26,490
so next time you see The Avengers or

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:29,580
spider-man or you see an explosion in a

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:33,470
new movie remember that movie was

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:36,450
created using open source software and

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:39,950
that's the most important thing I want

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:42,810
all of you to remember is that together

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:46,230
we're making all these really cool

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,950
things whether it's cloud computing

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:52,970
infrastructure mobile applications

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:56,700
movies automotive operating systems

00:15:52,970 --> 00:16:00,120
drones you name it it's all open source

00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:03,839
and the reason it's open source is

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:07,230
because open source is not a zero-sum

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,209
game you can help yourself you can help

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:14,820
your company you can help your country

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:17,670
at the same time you help others that's

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:21,300
what's important to remember here today

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:24,750
and I want to emphasize that the Linux

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,399
Foundation is committed to working here

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:32,010
with developers companies everyone in

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,649
China and we have some great news today

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:37,440
about some of the new and exciting

00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:40,829
things that we're going to be doing here

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,930
in China first I want to announce our

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,760
newest gold member of the Linux

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,279
Foundation we bank

00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:51,360
let's welcome we bank to the Linux

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,459
Foundation remember how I said open

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,730
source projects can start anywhere

00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:59,370
well the fête project was started here

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,329
in China by we Bank this is an

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,990
industrial-grade

00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:07,230
federated AI learning framework that

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:10,530
allows you to use learning architectures

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:14,189
and secure computation of any machine

00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:17,760
learning algorithm go check this out

00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:21,270
github calm /we Bank FinTech slash fate

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,520
it's an amazing new project started here

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,010
in China

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,670
