Description: 
	Use Cases and Lessons Learned From Kata Container Deployment in Production - Cheng Li & Jian Huang, Huawei 

Kata container has been used in a serverless k8s service called Cloud Container Instance in Huawei Cloud. In this talk, we will show how container kata fits into our architecture, and the performance and isolation test results for the Kata container in production. But as a young open source project, Kata container still has issues, for example, its heterogeneous hardware support is weak, its storage and network performance need improvement, etc. We will then share the experience how we resolve these issues and the suggestions from us to both CNCF and Kata containers.
