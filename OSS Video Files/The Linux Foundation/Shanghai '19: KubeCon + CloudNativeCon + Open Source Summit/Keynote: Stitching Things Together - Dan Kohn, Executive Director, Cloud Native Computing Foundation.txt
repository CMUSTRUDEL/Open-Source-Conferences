good morning and thank you to Brian for

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,600
the introduction the emceeing and to Jim

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,050
for going through all that fantastic

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,179
content about the Linux Foundation and

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:15,570
CNC F and so I get to take a little bit

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,460
of a step up and talk big picture about

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,980
some of the trends in open source and

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,080
where they've come from I'm Dan Kahn

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,880
executive director of CNC F where the

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,580
nonprofit organization that hosts these

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,130
projects helps organize this event and

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,160
here's a picture of our much smaller

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,780
conference two years ago in Berlin let

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,600
us zoom in on the graffiti orchestration

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,010
containerization microservices our

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,290
shorthand for explaining cloud native

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,360
last year our technical oversight

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,390
committee came up with a much more

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,960
expansive characterization the CNC F

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,370
cloud native definition version 1.0 it

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,280
includes ideas like declarative ap is

00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:02,910
resiliency observability an ecosystem of

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,650
open-source vendor-neutral projects one

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,380
word that's not included in the

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,330
definition is kubernetes that's because

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,729
kubernetes is a leading cloud native

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,150
implementation but certainly not the

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,340
only one so why are we at cube con and

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,549
not a conference about a different cloud

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,759
native platform or more succinctly why

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,560
kubernetes let's travel back in time a

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,560
bit and look at the question of why

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,439
certain technologies win out we'll start

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,090
in the year 2000 for a social networking

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,310
entrepreneur met with a number of

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,280
Silicon Valley investors including

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,990
Napster founder Sean Parker the founder

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,659
launched at his Ivy League university

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,280
dropped out of school and then expanded

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,829
the social network to many other

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,470
campuses building the site to hundreds

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,829
of thousands of users I'm talking of

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,829
course about campus network started at

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:59,070
Columbia University by Adam Goldberg a

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:02,100
month before Mark Zuckerberg launched

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,770
the Facebook at Harvard so why were

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,489
these two incredibly similar sites both

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,979
developed at essentially the same time I

00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:13,410
found my answer playing a game

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:19,950
how many of you have ever played Sid

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:21,780
Meier's Civilization yeah me too and sip

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,480
six is by twelve-year-olds favorite game

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,720
one of Sid Meier's greatest innovations

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,090
was to explicitly map out a technology

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,280
tree if you want to add Knights

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,560
as a warrior for your civilization you

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,140
need to first develop the stirrup to

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,690
domesticate horses and metalworking to

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,060
create armor the development of new

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,120
technologies depends on the availability

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,269
and sometimes the ubiquity of other

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,730
technologies both campus network and the

00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:53,130
Facebook depended on personal computers

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,530
and the Internet being available in dorm

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,810
rooms as well as a whole set of other

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,209
technologies such as algorithms for

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,000
efficient graph traversal and this

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,690
process of simultaneous invention is

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,230
something that we see throughout history

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,489
let's go back further in time to 1858

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,180
this is a picture of the British

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,310
naturalist

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,010
who collected beetles and spent his

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,090
formative years as a scientist

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,950
documenting the natural history of

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,620
whales he went on a multi-year

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,930
expedition in the mid-1800s to collect

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,840
specimens after reading a book on

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,180
population growth by Thomas Malthus he

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,450
formulated the theory of evolution

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,970
I'm not speaking of Charles Darwin

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,040
another British naturalist who collected

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:41,760
beetles studied Welsh natural history

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,280
went on a multi-year expedition and 11

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,889
years earlier after reading the same

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,739
book by Malthus discovered evolution

00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:52,230
know the man on the left is Alfred

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,599
Russel Wallace in history knows him as

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,530
the other person who discovered

00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,989
evolution quote the centrifugal governor

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,750
of the steam engine checks and corrects

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,599
any irregularities almost before they

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,120
become evident and in like manner no

00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,180
deficiency in the animal kingdom can

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,579
ever reach any magnitude that's Wallace

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,549
describing control theory which is

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:20,130
central to how both evolution and

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:23,430
kubernetes work we can go back further

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,720
to 1687 and see Gottfried Leibniz and

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,790
Isaac Newton

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,870
independently discovering the calculus

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:33,090
and finally we have john tyndall he is

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,660
often credited with first establishing

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,270
in 1859 that carbon dioxide is a

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,970
greenhouse gas that leads to climate

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,580
change standing in for eunice newton

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,310
foot we have the cover of her scientific

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,920
paper she made and published the

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,900
greenhouse gas discovery three years

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,240
earlier

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,880
despite her prior publication and also

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,490
being a signatory at Seneca Falls the

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,830
first women's rights convention no image

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:06,870
of foot has been found and her discovery

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:09,390
was not credited until 2010 simultaneous

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,570
invention is the concept that certain

00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:14,610
ideas are in the air the prerequisite

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,610
inventions have been made and now it

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,160
just takes a spark of creativity and a

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,740
lot of effort to build the next step in

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,230
the technology tree simultaneous

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,800
invention is a common occurrence through

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,250
history

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,430
so now let's return to this decade and

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,200
the cloud native definition a number of

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,419
companies have faced the challenge of

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,210
building and running applications at

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,880
scale and with the prerequisite

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,120
technologies having become available

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,620
including the internet and Linux a

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,440
Cambrian explosion of container

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,390
orchestrators was created these systems

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,940
each of which followed the cloud native

00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,520
definition enabled these companies to

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,410
reach web scale with fewer servers and

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,340
fewer staff than would have been

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:06,360
possible before they include Alibaba

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:09,180
Sigma Amazon Apollo Apache mezzos Baidu

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,930
Matrix cloud foundry garden and Diego

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:16,410
core OS fleet docker swarm Facebook

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:20,100
Tupperware and finally Google Borg and

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:22,020
Omega no just kidding we're only halfway

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,870
through there's also

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:29,190
hashey corp nomads IBM platform symphony

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:32,280
join at Triton lyft v3 infra Microsoft

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,510
service fabric Netflix tightest Rancher

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,669
cattle Red Hat open shift v2 broker

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:44,009
Spotify Helios 10-cent Gaea

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:46,919
Twitter Aurora and uber peloton haha so

00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:49,259
how are all of these organizations able

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,379
to develop similar approaches to their

00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,900
scaling challenges you could say that

00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:59,370
the prerequisite technologies were in

00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:02,219
the air and as Isaac Newton wrote we

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,680
stand on the shoulders of giants which

00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:07,159
is what Newton was doing when he adapted

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,169
that saying from Bernard de chartres

00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:12,180
which is what I am doing in that I

00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:14,849
reused those two quotes from the

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,560
fantastic video essay everything is a

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:22,680
remix but now let's return firmly to the

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,840
present we're all here at cube con cloud

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,389
native con open source summit Shanghai

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,099
many other technologies had to be

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:31,919
developed before cloud native could

00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:35,969
emerge but why aren't we at helios con

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,979
or matrix con or a Polock on these are

00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:39,839
the results of web searches on some of

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,750
the open source cloud native offerings

00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,240
over the last three years what is

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,969
responsible for kubernetes extraordinary

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,740
growth let's finally try to answer the

00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:55,830
earlier question why kubernetes in my

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,399
view there are three main reasons number

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,689
one it works really well

00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,000
kubernetes was not just built on a

00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,159
decade of learning within Google from

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,379
borg and Omega but has now also

00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:11,250
incorporated key architectural ideas

00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:15,300
from Red Hat Huawei and dozens of other

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:17,969
companies number two vendor-neutral

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,580
open source enterprises that are going

00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:22,620
to build on top of a platform want to

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,960
see multiple companies backing a

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,689
technology so they're not locked into a

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,779
single vendor no one wants to have to

00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:33,599
pay a platform tax for the lifetime of

00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:36,000
their application from the beginning

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,919
Google explicitly encouraged developers

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,550
from other companies to take leadership

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,740
roles in fact CN CF was created within

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,510
the Linux Foundation to provide a

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,760
neutral home for cloud native

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,310
technologies in his work through

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,590
programs like certified kubernetes to

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,550
ensure that the ecosystem does

00:08:52,590 --> 00:09:00,480
not fragment number three it's the

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:04,890
people kubernetes like Soylent Green is

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,360
people the project has been developed by

00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,060
an extraordinary group of contributors

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,940
has done an impressive job onboarding

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,550
new users what's been called the time to

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,860
first serotonin and has explicitly

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,350
worked to narrow the distance between

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,920
the steps of the contribution ladder

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:26,370
from user to contributor to reviewer to

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,710
leader so these are my three ideas on

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,900
the reasons for success but I'd love to

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,540
hear yours either in person here at the

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,730
conference or on WeChat or Twitter and

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,430
the thought I want to leave you with is

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,640
how deliberate all three elements of

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,610
kubernetes success have been to quote

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,440
the climate writer David Roberts

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,140
stitching things together building up

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,420
institutions that work figuring out how

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,720
to keep diverse interests on the same

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:58,020
page is difficult emotionally and

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,540
intellectually the magic of the

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,550
technology tree is that we can only be

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,070
here because our predecessors have

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,390
developed extraordinary innovations like

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:10,830
Linux and tcp/ip and in a bigger sense

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,620
evolution the calculus and the cause of

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,990
climate change in the work that we're

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,870
doing here together this week building

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:22,020
on top of the shoulders of giants maybe

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:24,780
neither Swift nor easy but is also

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,210
laying the foundations of the next

00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,060
generation of innovations which are even

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:34,860
now being built on top of kubernetes

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:38,430
and Linux we all of us are part of the

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,770
cloud Native community I entreat us to

00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,870
collaborate together in a spirit of

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:46,040
kindness and with an awareness of

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,460
history this week and Hereafter

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,129
thank you very much

00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,129
