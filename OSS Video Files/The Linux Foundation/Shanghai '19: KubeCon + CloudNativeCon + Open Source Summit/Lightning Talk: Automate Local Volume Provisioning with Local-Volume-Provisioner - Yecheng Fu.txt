	Lightning Talk: Automate Local Volume Provisioning with Local-Volume-Provisioner - Yecheng Fu, PingCAP 

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 â€“ April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

In this lightning talk, I'm going to demonstrate how to use local-volume-provisioner to discovery and reclaim local volumes on nodes, which includes following aspects:    - prepare local storage on nodes  - configure and deploy local-volume-provisioner  - how to use provisioned local volumes in workloads  - demonstrate how local volumes be reclaimed when workloads are destroyed    Moreover, as local-volume-provisioner maintainer I'll explain how it work internally if possible.
