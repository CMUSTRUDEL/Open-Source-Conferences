Description: 
	Lightning Talk: Automate Local Volume Provisioning with Local-Volume-Provisioner - Yecheng Fu, PingCAP 

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 â€“ April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

In this lightning talk, I'm going to demonstrate how to use local-volume-provisioner to discovery and reclaim local volumes on nodes, which includes following aspects:    - prepare local storage on nodes  - configure and deploy local-volume-provisioner  - how to use provisioned local volumes in workloads  - demonstrate how local volumes be reclaimed when workloads are destroyed    Moreover, as local-volume-provisioner maintainer I'll explain how it work internally if possible.

my my name is official I'm from backup

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:14,580
and today I want to talk about the local

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:18,330
volumetric prevention mission so this is

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,689
the type of the local presented the

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,869
volume and it is a local storage

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:29,580
resources are bound to the note like a

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:33,750
sec and SF e it can provide the fire

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:37,290
through puja and na VI F and it can only

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,480
have their local access and one layer is

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,899
a malfunction it has enough access

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,350
because the Volga local storage it has

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,230
two types of scenario and one is try

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,699
giving and etcd another either the local

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:58,920
are a shape and it can tolerate this

00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:02,699
added a lot the local our storage in the

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,360
cumulative 1.14 it is already available

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:12,600
and you're welcome to use it and you can

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,490
use PVC to go to the access and pro to

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,439
prote

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,170
do the provision of the local police in

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,470
hazard a static mode for volumes and the

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,360
dynamic and the Tanana is now on the

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,740
development so today want to talk about

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:32,189
the local volume of professional

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:35,040
services their provision area on address

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,990
of this a project and you are most

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,170
welcome to participate in the

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:45,119
development so are you can file for the

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:49,380
local volume and communities and evil it

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,210
is not used it will be recycled and the

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,670
other program can work on it

00:01:51,210 --> 00:02:00,119
automatically and also it has two steps

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:02,250
one is the two for me

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,689
local volumes are a Minolta to be

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,479
configured and the second is to

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:10,830
configure and deploy the local volume

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:17,370
from Asia and this is a simple flow

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:20,760
chart now configuration of some

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:27,090
appletinis passes the several typical

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:29,879
steps for the faster product faster

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:36,170
equipment with an imperative to the

00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:39,769
target and the catalog in search of the

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:44,970
probationer connected to the local

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:49,739
machine and also it can be shared with

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:54,629
the local PD with the monocle catalog

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:56,730
and then you will have the black volumes

00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:59,280
that will link the multi licenses into

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,230
the disk of radius T dictionary and also

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,739
you can have the file system and volume

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,940
segment the entire file system into the

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:15,630
discovery dictionary over here in this

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:20,569
project we have the hem enter it is very

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:24,540
simple it can have the teacher flow and

00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:27,359
to have the manifest uyama files about

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,030
using the help with like your customize

00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:33,120
the values and edit the values file with

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,430
your dictionary and storage class and

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,150
then do the deploy and follow the same

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,370
to get more information and here it is

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,220
served up as the practices of over the

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,799
local PD the pass of thermopylae me

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,769
these are the unique identifier of the

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:55,719
local storage on the node

00:03:50,769 --> 00:04:00,170
it is recommended to utilize as a UUID

00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:02,599
to of the divisor to generated a pause

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,340
and for the IO isolation

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,670
I hope this Kepler volumes over

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,819
recommended it is very hard to schedule

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:14,030
IOPS in the deterministic behavior

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:16,910
compared to the memory and the CPU so

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,919
for the capacity isolation by separated

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:24,020
application per volume is also

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:27,020
recommended and also you can also choose

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,720
a different activation and to do the

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:34,780
isolation on the filesystem and this is

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,780
