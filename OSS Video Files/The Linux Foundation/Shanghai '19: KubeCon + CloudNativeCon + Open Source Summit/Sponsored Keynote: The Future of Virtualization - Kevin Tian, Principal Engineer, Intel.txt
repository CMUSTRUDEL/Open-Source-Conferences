hello everyone today I will introduce

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,980
the future of virtualization and how

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,309
virtualization technology fits in the

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,110
cloud native infrastructure so if you

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,660
look back to 10 years or 15 years ago

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,670
when we talk about virtualization it's

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,830
all about the server consolidation with

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,830
legacy applications it's also the

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,439
driving force for early cloud but now

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,510
with the advancement of relative people

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,449
care more about how to build in wrong

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,050
applications natively in cloud for this

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,239
goal is actually requires lots of

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,239
technologies including orchestration

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,180
container functional service Crapo main

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,670
service infrastructure service etc among

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,930
those the technologies if we look at the

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,300
core of the cloud data with

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,239
infrastructure with tradition technology

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:56,219
can still play a critical role for what

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:58,530
the best isolation in the security so if

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,800
you look into the ecosystem last year

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,680
Amazon introduced a fire cracker which

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,799
is a night to attack a be invested Bamm

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,530
for function and the service as we also

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,299
know the cat a container it's it uses

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,390
the hardware virtualization technology

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,700
for the speed of containers and security

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,860
of virtual machine so we must have

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,869
shifted the virtualization technology to

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,869
meet those new requirements in quality

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,979
in this slide actually give some

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,900
examples of the new requirements for

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:36,869
this shift for the training technology

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,079
is need to be natural that we the means

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,170
the small memory footprint simplicity

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,409
and also small attacking surface and

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,840
also be fast for the to bring us the

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,670
bare metal experience at the high

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,909
density for the best use of the

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,420
computing resource quick startup for the

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,790
NGO lifecycle management and of course

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,540
security is always the fundamental

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,219
requirement in cloud so the older

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,380
version technology has to change

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,229
we must affinity from the sole

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,260
consolidating purpose to any combination

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,400
of the

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:18,159
do cloud data requirements a recent

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,709
answer to this shift is Rusted within

00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,129
this project entities comes out of a

00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:26,220
firecracker the crossbeam but it goes

00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:30,180
much broader a primary goal of

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:33,250
Russellville is to now build a classroom

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:37,030
remember easily so you can consider it

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:39,970
in the library or label a set of or

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,450
tradition components anyone can pick and

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:46,150
drag to build a custom hypervisor real

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,030
quickly on top of the satchel trusted

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,040
base then people can focus more on the

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,069
differentiating features in their own

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,129
knowledge so the core philosophy of

00:02:54,069 --> 00:03:00,190
rostov M is a modular as Junius figure

00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:02,260
so the blue hundred books are already in

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,190
the option report as the nice blue color

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,909
boxes are still under development

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,799
current uses selected based on the

00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,510
modern correlative requirements by

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,790
suggest a starting point there will be

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,010
more features coming in the future and

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:21,579
here are some examples including the

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,739
device models a memory abstraction the

00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:26,769
albertov a host of actions and also the

00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:29,049
way file divides pass through calsilica

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,099
vm is the only supported hypervisor but

00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,769
people are also working through

00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,620
extending to support other hypervisors

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:38,290
such as the hyper-v so this is a

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,319
community work and it came to life in

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,989
Nashville December currently with active

00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,919
developers from Alibaba Amazon Google

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:49,900
interviewed has many companies and

00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,440
another I would like to give an example

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,659
how to use reservation to build a modern

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,849
cloud hypervisor so here when I say

00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:59,889
modern it means to the target is for the

00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,989
modern cloud applications and recent

00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:04,870
hardware for example we don't care about

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:08,349
the legacy devices the on the goal is to

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,299
reduce the emulation complicity that

00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:13,269
provides a much smaller attacking

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:15,909
surface compared to existing VM for

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,940
example to MU of course it also need to

00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:21,420
provide the high performance as no

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,460
latency so look at this our teacher the

00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,100
call the collaborator is based on the

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,980
rostrum it tries to use the and much of

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,840
the rest women code as possible in the

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,300
same time we also use a cross have a

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,310
very intuitive eater the taste new

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,320
features which has to miss in Drosophila

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,450
civilian community for example and live

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,150
migration and the muscles feature done

00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,210
we will contribute back to the rest of

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,170
em community very quickly and

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,120
collaborate also supported the

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,600
third-party components for Lamberty vdk

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,230
so this project was released this mean

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,910
and the current it is still new but

00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:00,330
there are not suitable progress also

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,940
reflected in the relevant community so

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,790
we will come on contributing to both

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,950
projects to hypervisor and also relevant

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,840
and the networks together to make the

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,850
virtualization technology still in the

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,930
center of the cloud native in faster

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,860
infrastructure

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,059
thank you very much

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,059
