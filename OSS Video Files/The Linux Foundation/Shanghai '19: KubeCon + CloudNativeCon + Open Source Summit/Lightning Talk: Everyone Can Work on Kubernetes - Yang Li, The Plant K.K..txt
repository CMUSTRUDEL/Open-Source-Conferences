Description: 
	Lightning Talk: Everyone Can Work on Kubernetes - Yang Li, The Plant K.K. 

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 â€“ April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

Many Kubernetes end-users are eager to participate in the development of the project. However, Kubernetes itself can be intimidating for those that don't know where to start.    In this talk, Yang Li from The Plant will share his story of contributing to Kubernetes as a Chinese software engineer. He hopes to help new contributors start their journey. Yang will discuss how he began contributing to Kubernetes, what problems he encountered, and speak on what it is like to work with such a fantastic community. He will explain how end-users can benefit from contributing to the project, what he gained from this experience, and lastly, he will share some tips for those who want to start contributing.    Whether you wish to fix some bugs you have encountered, improve or localize documentation, or you need to work with Kubernetes as a part of your job, you will be welcomed in this community.

good afternoon in Macomb Iyanla I'm from

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:12,990
the plank ke ke yeah I'm very glad that

00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:14,969
from 2017 I was exposed to kinetics yeah

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,310
and also when year later I'm very

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,880
privileged to be a part of the community

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,300
and so far it has been one year yeah and

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,109
also today I'm gonna share with you my

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,619
stories in that last year so first of

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,890
all why everyone can work on genetics

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,649
yep because everyone can work for an

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,110
open-source project and a one of which

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:44,149
the or the largest one is the bananas

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:48,750
you can do everything on Kevin Alex and

00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:52,140
some people may ask me why yeah this is

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,710
the author from es link this is the

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,230
story of the Twitter he talked to

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:03,120
his mother I have written down yet lanes

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:06,240
everyone is using it but I haven't made

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,080
any money yet so from the Twitter there

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,760
are so many replies are from their views

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:17,700
so the author wrapped up by himself if

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,780
we want to be the maintainer of the open

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,119
project so there are many fragmented a

00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,700
feedback this is also the target we

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,450
should work hard for and also hopefully

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,320
all of you will have some answers to

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:38,549
this question and now I will start the

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,970
sharing of my journey in 2017 in the

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,700
middle of 2017 I submitted to - what

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,790
project - the Chinese translation is a

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,759
relatively simple in tribution I think

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,020
everyone may start from such a dear deed

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:58,020
I am also appealed by urban attics of

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:03,270
values I'm really touched by such an

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,850
article so that's our core spirit of the

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,560
community and this is also why Cuban

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,860
ethics proves to be so successful and

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,220
also I'm gonna share with you a

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,860
distribution is

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,410
better than centralization and many

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,200
people working for cuban addicts

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,620
terminating over any single product or

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,020
several companies it's not only about

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,230
the steps of limited numbers of

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:35,250
companies and as an also community is

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:38,820
more than product or companies community

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,460
matters yes they take holders may be

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,010
dynamic a product lineup may be also

00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,670
dynamic where only a personal talents

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,750
are the core competencies number three

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,459
automation over protests we are

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,470
dedicating ourselves to developing

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,020
automation tools for testing or

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,400
documentation to really help our

00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:02,490
projects to be very well maintained

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,580
number four this is a community of

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:08,400
inclusion we welcome everyone to be on

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,470
board and the last not least fanatics is

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,540
already quite sophisticated but they are

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,610
still a long way to go so your

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,630
participation and contributions are a

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:22,680
welcomed and also I'm firmly convinced

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:26,489
most of us use English as a second

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:33,870
language yeah I feel that you don't

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:39,030
answer to be afraid and also we do need

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:41,190

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,459
