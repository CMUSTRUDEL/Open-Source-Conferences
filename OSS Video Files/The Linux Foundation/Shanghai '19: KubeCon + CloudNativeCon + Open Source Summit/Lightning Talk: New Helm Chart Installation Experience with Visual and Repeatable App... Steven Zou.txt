The Helm Chart operator still needs to handle the massive kinds of value settings, especially for some very complicated applications although Helm Chart brings a relatively easy way to do that. The Helm Chart installation experiences and the repeatability of Helm Chart value settings still need to be improved.    In this presentation, based on the real practices of deploying Harbor and managing Helm Charts in Harbor, we'd like to share some good ideas of how to easily and repeatedly launch the Helm Chart installation process. The main contents may include:  - A wizard can be applied to render validate the settings (values.yaml) of installing Chart;  - The values set for the corresponding Chart settings are persisted as Chart deployment config for future reusing;  - The Chart deployment config for Chart installation can be managed in the repository for diffing, copying and reusing.  - Demo
