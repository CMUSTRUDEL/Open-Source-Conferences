Description: 
	Lightning Talk: New Helm Chart Installation Experience with Visual and Repeatable Approach - Steven Zou, VMware 

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 â€“ April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

The Helm Chart operator still needs to handle the massive kinds of value settings, especially for some very complicated applications although Helm Chart brings a relatively easy way to do that. The Helm Chart installation experiences and the repeatability of Helm Chart value settings still need to be improved.    In this presentation, based on the real practices of deploying Harbor and managing Helm Charts in Harbor, we'd like to share some good ideas of how to easily and repeatedly launch the Helm Chart installation process. The main contents may include:  - A wizard can be applied to render validate the settings (values.yaml) of installing Chart;  - The values set for the corresponding Chart settings are persisted as Chart deployment config for future reusing;  - The Chart deployment config for Chart installation can be managed in the repository for diffing, copying and reusing.  - Demo

athleisure Chinese and Steven Tom from

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:12,300
we're also working for harbor at the

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,730
commentator of on Cynthia object that's

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,710
very my topic is Harman charts based

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,590
insulation in some of the expressive

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:23,189
from Vera especially Anna repeatable

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,080
Mike two considerations so what are the

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,170
challenges and motivations for the

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,080
appearance but harbor has make ECOnetic

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,750
Department easier which is a modular

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,969
based and also it is based on the

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,860
configuration of the parameters but

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,890
during the installation these two need

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,890
to cover it with multiple parameters and

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,039
also sometimes these fellows don't have

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,050
the same llamo to validate you will

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,420
already have seen it in a harm easy or

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,370
free and I we introduced that but there

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,199
will still be some challenges and we

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,160
don't have a very consistent high

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,859
quality experience on the mirror side

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,830
yeah for the parameters for installation

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,799
including the customer sightings are not

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,320
convenient for being repeatable so I'm

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,900
considering on improving them so my idea

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,030
is to offer a deployment service the

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,700
deployment service will cut further it

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,369
will fetch a charter so from the charter

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,920
can extract the values and the schemers

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,009
based on that you a you generate a

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,759
standardized Aveda as well as a form

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,960
list yes you can output that to UI site

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,090
so that our users may use the visualizer

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,650
visitor to do the customization if you

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,930
finish the setting of customization you

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,939
may use deployment to deployed to the

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,880
target environment and a storage as a

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,180
deployment settings and that deployment

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,090
parents can be repeatable yeah that

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,820
means you may do the versioning of

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,860
deployment settings you can do some diff

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,869
between the two different versions you

00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,460
may identify some difference based on

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,469
the current of versions can you

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,740
duplicate I brand-new configuration

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,770
items

00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,600
from before half we three have we

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,120
already considered this issue we already

00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,180
have some validation injection injection

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,430
yes and also from the scammer of the

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,310
community it will have nothing more you

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,430
may have also the validation script

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,350
information and also they are up omit

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,390
and the down limit lower limit of some

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,069
well values so you may put out into the

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:32,390
injections or you may use the existing

00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:36,920
or incumbent cameras okay this is also

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:40,100
the very visual wizard example for all

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,040
the settings is based on your design the

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,010
value that can be rendered into the

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,590
visit page and can be put into different

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,690
sections the top can be the part of the

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,810
structures the one in the purple part

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,760
and be turned into a form of a certain

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,160
page and that the other values can be

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,200
converted into input about as well as

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,110
the action box so that consumers can

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,000
enter the most important information so

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,069
all the input of our users will be

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,130
validated it will give the user some

00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:13,489
hints or cues if it is not compliant

00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,910
with the input requirements and also we

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,829
mentioned that deployment can be

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:22,250
configurations and be persistent and

00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:24,320
also forever they can do that based on

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,380
different versions and it will help you

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,470
to reveal all of the configuration items

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,049
you can do the diff between two versions

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,120
and a based on the existing ones where

00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:38,360
you generate a new options of

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:44,890
configuration you can re install based

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,890
on the current values your chart okay

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,700
looking ahead into the feature where we

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,340
considered how much discussion was the

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,620
community and a deliverer a prototype we

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,200
will also find some opportunities as

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,540
well as some open source projects

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,180
including silver apps we will deliver

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,620
jointly these features and in terms of

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,140
some more thoughts

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,840
apart from charge for sustain the

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,940
fairmont framework can be general right

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,130
and we can support all of the bundles

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,880
and a reality and the related settings

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,830
and even with or without a scammer

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,910
without chemical we inject the scammer

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:24,250
it is not only pure value it can be a

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,830
wizard-based installation so for the

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,960
department custom configuration customer

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,630
settings as well as the ham chart

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,750
release of department can be unified

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:37,390
into one new bundle that new bundle can

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,330
be a clock native content then can be

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:43,270
stored alterna back to artifactory here

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,250
based on the previous deployed artifacts

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,890
to have the core relationship it will

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,520
help to track and do the statistics of

00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:54,070
all of these safety items well such an

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,590
idea is just to offer you more

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,300
opportunities of takeaways and to

00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,560
discuss with you yeah you are welcome to

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,920
have discussion with me thank you for

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,920
