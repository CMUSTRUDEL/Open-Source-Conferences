	Lightning Talk: Back From the Future: A Time Traveler's Take on Serverless - Yunong Xiao, Tencent 

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 â€“ April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

I've been to the future, and have seen a Serverless world where cloud and infrastructure are accessible to everyone, not just those with computer science backgrounds -- helping to level the playing field and allowing everyone to leverage the cloud.    Join me for a recap of my trip where I cover what's possible when you never have to worry about infrastructure, operations or even execution limits! A world where your entire business runs Serverless, not just peripheral event-driven tasks!    No more fiddling with uncomfortable APIs or misusing API Gateway just so your functions can stay warm! The future of the cloud is now!
