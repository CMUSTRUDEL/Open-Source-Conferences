Description: 
	Applying Geospatial Analytics at a Massive Scale using Kafka, Spark and Elasticsearch on DC/OS - Adam Mollenkopf, Esri

This session will explore how DC/OS and Mesos are being used at Esri to establish a foundational operating environment to enable the consumption of high velocity IoT data using Apache Kafka, streaming analytics using Apache Spark, high-volume storage and querying of spatiotemporal data using Elasticsearch, and recurring batch analytics using Apache Spark & Metronome. Additionally, Esri will share their experience in making their application for DC/OS portable so that it can easily be deployed amongst public cloud providers (Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2), private cloud providers and on-premise environments. Demonstrations will be performed throughout the presentation to cement these concepts for the attendees.
