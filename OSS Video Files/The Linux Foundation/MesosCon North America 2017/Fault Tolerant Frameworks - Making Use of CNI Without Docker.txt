Description: 
	Fault Tolerant Frameworks - Making Use of CNI Without Docker - Aaron Wood & Tim Hansen, Verizon

While most people use Docker for their containerization efforts, it is in no way a requirement for Mesos frameworks. This presentation will cover how Verizon built their own highly available, performant framework utilizing the universal containerizer and the container network interface. Specific topics of interest include how high availability was built, the reasons behind Go as the language of choice, the benefits that CNI provides, pros and cons of using the universal containerizer, and a quick overview of the accompanying SDK. Usage of the new V1 streaming API will also be covered.
