Description: 
	Real-Time Event Processing and Handling Stateful Applications on Apache Mesos - Balajee Nagarajan & Venkatesh Sivasubramanian, GE Digital

In order to deliver DevOps a cloud native application development and deployment experience, most enterprises are seeking to run all workloads on a container runtime platform. Come see us cover some of our experience in running non-trivial workloads on Mesos.
Key Points:
1. Quick intro to industrial use-cases and the problem space
2. Learn about our PaaS Journey (w/ Cloud and CloudFoundry)
3. Discussion on how GE is handling stateful applications on Mesos
4. Big Data with Mesos: Learn about how we built a stream processing platform on Mesos:
. Spark Streaming on Mesos (With near realtime performance)
. Heron/Storm on Mesos (where latency in less than few ms matters)
5. Learn how we managed the complexity of stateful applications on a container platform
. Share our experiences with external persistence
6. Demo
a. See how we stitch all these together for a real world use case.
