	GASP! My Container Cluster Just Went Down and I Don’t Know Why! - Kamalakannan Muralidharan, PayPal & Ranga Rajagopalan, Avi Networks

Traffic management in a container environment, especially for microservices involves more than just load balancing. Load balancing traffic from client to core service (north-south) along with inter-service and inter-cluster interactions (east-west) is key.

There are different ways of load balancing methods in a container architecture:
North-south (Fronting LB)
East-West (Client side)

The primary challenges with load balancing in a dynamic environment (like cluster manager environment) are the consequences of a container outage. 
How do I do IP per POD vs Port Mapping?
How can I enforce dynamic registration as part of the container lifecycle?
