	IP Anycast: DC/OS Networking for the Modern Datacenter - Bill Green, New Relic, Inc.

Modern datacenter networks are leveraging BGP and spine-leaf topologies to enable massive scale-out. This presentation will survey New Relic's implementation of IP Anycast for Docker containers running on DC/OS. Such an implementation allows several containers to be deployed with the same IP address, allowing the network to share traffic between them. We will explore some container deployments that are greatly simplified by using this technique.
