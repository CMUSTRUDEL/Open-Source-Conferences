	Streaming Data Pipelines on Apache Mesos: Lessons Learned - Dean Wampler, Ph.D., Lightbend

Lightbend Fast Data Platform (http://lightbend.com/fast-data-platform) is a suite of open-source streaming tools, including Kafka, Spark, Flink, Akka Streams, and Kafka Streams, running on Mesosphere DC/OS. Lightbend picked Mesos for its flexibility to support the diverse requirements of streaming and batch data processing, as well as other microservices typically required in production environments.

Dean will begin by describing the features of Mesos that were important for Lightbend's needs. He will illustrate the details of those features using examples from how the tools mentioned above work with Mesos, both for long-running daemons and per-job processes. Dean will share lessons learned running applications built with these tools on Mesos and he will conclude with thoughts about future developments and improvements.
