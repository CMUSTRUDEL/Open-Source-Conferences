Description: 
	Building Your First Stateful DC/OS Service - Ben Wood, Mesosphere (limited spots, pre-registration suggested)

Apache Mesos and DC/OS are powerful orchestration tools. But, building stateful application on top of DC/OS requires understanding Apache Mesos primitives and DC/OS components, and writing complex scheduler code. 

From a birdâ€™s eye view, most stateful systems look similar. Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra, and other stateful systems have their own concerns, but they all need to provision storage, scale capacity, be discoverable by clients, be manageable by operators, and be resilient to failure (which is complicated for databases). 

In this talk, Ben will demonstrate by example how the DC/OS SDK enables you to build stateful applications which satisfy these common requirements. Particular attention will be paid to how the abstractions of the DC/OS SDK free developers from focusing on interfacing with Apache Mesos and DC/OS and instead concentrate on building a robust stateful service.
