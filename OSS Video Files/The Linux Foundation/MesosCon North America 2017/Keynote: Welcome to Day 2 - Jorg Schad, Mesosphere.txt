good morning mrs. Kahn did you all have

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,379
a good time so far did you have fun at

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,530
the town halls and other dinners events

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,840
last night awake tomorrow morning or

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,820
still asleep

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,580
okay let's slowly wake up before the

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,189
main tracks are starting so while I'm

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,830
talking is time to wake up before you

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,930
have to be awake for the keynotes my

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,880
name is York shad I'm been with

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,980
mesosphere for almost three years by now

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,320
I started out as like a core developer

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,260
so coding on the core missus is why I'm

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,090
really excited to be at mrs. Kahn seeing

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,910
all the great tech around missus

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,160
evolving and since about half a year

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,260
when I relocated to San Francisco I'm

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,270
more a developer advocate so I also

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,739
helped organizing this event this is

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,500
also why it's so great to see so many

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,210
people being here and coming all of this

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,699
coming together in such great events

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,340
thank you all for being here

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,829
and that's actually those last three

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,989
days it's already day three of mrs. Kahn

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,080
it's amazing it's been moving pretty

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,240
quickly so let's have a short recap of

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,080
what was actually going on on the last

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,090
three days

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,220
on Wednesday we started out with a

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,520
hackathon showed race of hands who were

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,580
seriousiy hackathon yes I've seen some

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,220
hands it was really amazing of what I

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,560
took away from this hackathon usually at

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,049
a hackathon we are all focusing on like

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,170
core topics where we want to get code

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,210
into Apache mesas or some cool demo

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,490
framework around which was also

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,890
happening on Wednesday but what I really

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,439
enjoyed is said a lot of focus was put

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,420
on like user experience we had a bunch

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,790
of people who were writing debt of who

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,280
were writing documentation we were

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,680
writing UI improvements which actually

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,649
helps all of us who are using missiles

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,570
to either understand the documentation

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,479
or the cool features which are in makes

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,250
us better or also you see UI and hands

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,380
visualize better what we are actually

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,899
using there so that I found like an

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,820
amazing outcome of this hackathon just

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,590
make it all more usable make it more

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,520
approachable also for people who might

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,929
be new to the communities then yesterday

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,590
we actually started out with the

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,020
keynotes

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,740
and the one keynote which I remember

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,810
most

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,430
is actually the kubernetes keynote

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,090
because for me this was a pretty

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,490
exciting announcement as well and seeing

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,170
all the work around it I actually I

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,880
worked back when we started office

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,270
kubernetes I also worked on the first

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,610
kubernetes version and so it's really

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,560
cool to see it right now how many of you

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,970
participated in that survey we are just

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,680
seeing here almost all of you cool so we

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,330
actually we had some really fun user

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,880
agents when we looked at the results

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,010
later on first of all it was nice to see

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,410
just also by the show of hands how many

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,240
of you were participating and we

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,840
actually we had to scale the agents in

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,130
the background to more containers to

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,690
accommodate all the workload you guys

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,060
were creating so there's always pretty

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,720
amazing to see then looking at the

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,700
different user agents it's actually

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,740
considering the War iPhone where is this

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,430
Android here Android is still winning

00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:14,520
and so let's see how that will change

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,470
next year and actually Ross who's going

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,450
to give another keynote later on he was

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:23,430
probably this one person who used his

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:26,340
Windows Phone or so that was pretty cool

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,560
to see some people try to hack us here

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,900
trying to see how they can play with the

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,830
user agents or it came up with some

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,540
other funny user agents so we actually

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,510
we had fun last night checking that out

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,000
so that was cool to see the other

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,070
keynotes they were also really amazing I

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,380
really enjoyed the different panels just

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,000
hearing from different people and also

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,130
looking back on the different tracks

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,590
yesterday this was kind of like what I

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,780
took out of it there were a lot of great

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,190
technical talks but yesterday there was

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:02,430
a focus on actually user experience and

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:05,630
sharing what X Y a what experiences we

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,740
have made what tips we can share so

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,500
basically running missiles in like

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,840
production environments hearing of what

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,200
use cases that enabled that was kind of

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,299
like this key takeaway from me yesterday

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,790
across the keynotes across the keynote

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:25,100
panels and and also across a different

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:27,510
session so that I found really amazing

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,490
also yesterday we had see you

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,690
versity session how many of you attended

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,390
one of those university sessions so yeah

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,850
also many people actually yes and this

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,980
is also from sitting in the room it was

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,720
amazing we didn't anticipate so many

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,700
people to join we had some network

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,070
problems pulling down docker containers

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,810
because it was just so many people but

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,130
that's also learning for us like next

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,600
year we're just gonna have more access

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,850
points or come up with a different way

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,370
but it was amazing to see so many people

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,200
being excited to learn about it and then

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,180
actually also staying and doing stuff so

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,090
seeing people interact with maysa

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,630
interact with TCS this is always for me

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,790
working on it it's pretty nice to see in

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,950
the evening we then head to town halls

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,440
and the tunnels was really focused on

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,930
community we wanted to bring together

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,000
the different communities because mostly

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,220
we are communicating why I slacked why a

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,930
mailing list and mrs. Kahn is always

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,970
this opportunity to bring everyone

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,820
together and actually communicate in

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,980
person I was at the DC US Town Hall and

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,830
we had amazing discussions we actually

00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:34,470
we were almost kicked out later on

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,240
because we were staying so late so that

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,180
was really a vibrant discussion and

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,190
thanks for everyone being here and

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,290
thanks is actually a pretty good keyword

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,300
so I would like to thank all the

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,780

this possible and most of them they're

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,240
actually also contributing to the entire

00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,040
ecosystem around so it's not to just

we had so many contributions this altar

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,060
why it took so long to come up with a

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,890
schedule we spent numerous hours just

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,140
reading through all this great proposals

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,630
and we were almost trying because we had

00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,270
to leave so many great proposals out so

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,490
this was really amazing to see and also

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,870
thank you for reviewing community so
