	How Yelp.com Runs on Apache Mesos in AWS Spot Fleet for Fun and Profit - Kyle Anderson, Yelp

AWS Spot Fleet is a mechanism to launch EC2 instances in AWS with deep discounts (~80%).
They come with a catch: instances can be recalled with a 120 second notice.

Can the business value of saving all that money be balance with the operational risk of running on such (theoretically) unstable infrastructure? At Yelp the answer to that question is "Yes!"

In this presentation Kyle Anderson from Yelp will explain the how Yelp.com runs on this infrastructure, including the special configuration tweaks needed for Mesos, Marathon, Chronos, maintenance primitives, and custom autoscalers, that are necessary to run keep the infrastructure reliable. (Spoiler alert: Mesos is the key)
