	Lessons Learned: Deploying Microservices Software Product in Customer Environments - Mark Galpin, JFrog, Inc.

Any team with strong DevOps practices wants to move to a microservices model to get the most out of them. But honestly, a lot of DevOps, and the best practices laid out for microservices, assumes that you have control over the deployment environment. But what if you don’t?
At JFrog we developed a microservices, cloud-native container-based design, and then we had to help our customers deploy it to diverse environments. Some of which didn’t allow containers. We will discuss our love for Apache Mesos and DC/OS, and why its always central to our thinking in deployment design, but what we do to help customers who can’t use it. What did we learn? What are we taking into older products we are now trying to break into microservices? What do we take forward? What mistakes have we sworn never to make again? Come and find out!
