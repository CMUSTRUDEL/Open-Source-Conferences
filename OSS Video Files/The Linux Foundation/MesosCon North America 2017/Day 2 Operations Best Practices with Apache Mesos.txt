	Day 2 Operations Best Practices with Apache Mesos - Janet Yu, SignalFx & Ben Lin, Mesosphere

Youâ€™ve got a Mesos cluster running, now what? Keeping up with a dynamic production environment requires an arsenal of flexible tools. Standing up the cluster is just the beginning. How do you know that the cluster is healthy and behaving as expected? What metrics should be measured to proactively discover inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the system? 

This is the realm of Day 2 Operations, the critical piece that keeps your applications humming and your pager silent. Common challenges that are faced in Day 2 Operations will be discussed, with a demo highlighting a fully integrated solution.
