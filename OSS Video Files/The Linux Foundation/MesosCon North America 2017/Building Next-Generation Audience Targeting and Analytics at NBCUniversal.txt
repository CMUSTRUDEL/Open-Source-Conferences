alright so next up we've got Thomas bar

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,130
from nbc/universal was the chief

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,780
architect there and he's going to talk

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,440
about building next generation audience

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:23,789
targeting and analytics can you hear me

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:24,240
good all right so as mentioned I'm Tom

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,359
Barr

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,510
I'm from NBC Universal I am part of our

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,969
advanced advertising group okay so we

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:39,300
are responsible for those dreadful ads

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:41,550
you see on TV and everything else but

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,489
our industry just like a lot of

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,520
industries how are facing some severe

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,820
challenges in this environment right the

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,570
competition for your attention has never

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,789
been greater all right we have cat

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,070
videos which is you know we were talking

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,070
about in DCOs days we're making fun of

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,930
it but you know when you think about all

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,960
of the self you know user-generated

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,060
content that's out there the youtubes

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,939
everything else that's vying for your

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,210
attention you know it's no longer an age

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,790
where the family comes home has dinner

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,150
together sits down and watches TV at

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,180
night right we all consume our content

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,180
in different ways which creates unique

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:32,549
challenges to us but also creates

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:35,220
tremendous opportunity right and so the

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,790
advanced advertising group at NBC is

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:42,270
been set up to take advantage of that to

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,259
not look at it as you know TV is

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,149
yesterday's media is to take that

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:51,659
original content that we have excelled

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,689
at for so long and then though allow it

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,189
to be you know viewed across all of the

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,229
different distribution channels in

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,360
different ways and to be able to

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,210
monetize that and take advantage of that

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,259
and so we were asked to stand up a

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,560
cutting-edge platform to house all those

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,239
data assets and allow us to do that and

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,220
we've you know I'm going to discuss with

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,210
you how

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,150
first of all some of the business

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:20,140
challenges a little bit more detail and

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:24,470
then go into what we do with DCOs

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:27,860
so would it surprise you today that you

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:30,530
know we sell essentially advertising on

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:34,850
TV the same way today as we did 50 years

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:38,810
ago right we sell 70% of our advertising

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:41,390
upfront it's not data driven if you ever

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,610
saw this show Mad Men it's very similar

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:48,620
to that and yes there is a lot of

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:51,230
alcohol involved right and you know we

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,970
literally there's no data analytics

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,459
driving behind this we're very little

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,830
right a chief marketing officer will

00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,540
come up during our up fronts which

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,000
kickoff in this big event in New York

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,520
oil in the well everybody does this

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,110
right and they'll just sit there and

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,250
literally sometimes they'll say well you

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:14,390
know my kids watch The Voice let me buy

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,880
the voice right okay we'll sell you the

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,130
voice doesn't mean that they're

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,209
necessarily getting to the audience that

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:28,400
they want right but we'll sell them the

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:31,459
voice what's worse is we sell it 1-1

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,850
selling title at a time all right we

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:37,340
don't really know we have intuitive

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,560
feeling but we kind of sell it by one

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,600
selling title at a time it's the same

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,049
thing that's been done for 50 years and

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,400
when you think about that right I was

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:50,870
thinking about this on the plane ride

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,980
here this week entire industries have

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:57,709
cut have started from nothing become

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,739
raging hot and now have disappeared off

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,680
the planet in those 50 years that we

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:06,410
have essentially done the same thing

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,260
right Blockbuster came to mind I was

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,180
thinking about that right started up

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,840
gangbusters once when we started putting

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:18,709
videos on VHS it was the darling of Wall

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:22,910
Street for so long and now it's gone yet

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:25,250
TV has perservere right this year will

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,010
do about 10 billion dollars in linear

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,390
tea

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:33,760
okay and so it's a very good business

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:36,430
but we face the challenges that I

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:40,480
described and so how do we take

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:43,630
advantage of that all right so what we

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,840
want to do is find follow and engage our

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:57,360
consumers in a personalized way to

00:04:46,840 --> 00:05:03,190
navigate this monumental shift okay so

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:10,900
that just went nuts oh I see this is

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:13,000
animation silly me never better than

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,400
viewing though and then I by the way you

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,650
can tell but and there's there's a prize

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,050
and not really because he'll ask me for

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,790
it but at a certain point in this

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,830
presentation you're gonna see where I go

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,200
out of the marketing slides and then go

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,910
into the engineering slides it's really

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,580
obvious I'll clue you in

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,710
alright but most people don't know you

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,470
know I mean we're familiar with NBC and

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,510
some of our shows but when you look at

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,210
all of the distribution channels that we

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:43,300
have our content providers our

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,040
partnerships you know we're called NBC

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,870
Universal because we have Universal

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,660
parts we have Universal two movie

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,970
theaters right we have all of the

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,690
network's you see up there this gives us

00:05:51,970 --> 00:06:00,490
a huge amount of reach and every one of

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,320
these issue you know distribution

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,620
channels networks that you see are

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,640
backed up with applications and websites

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:12,340
that all generate content and we're not

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,100
really taking advantage of that content

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,710
because of how we're structured you know

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,010
all of our brands are individual and

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,750
they operate fairly independently so

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:26,890
part of the event part of our challenge

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,260
is to gather all that data create a 360

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:32,950
degree view of our consumers so that we

00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,900
can then target our you know provide

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:38,970
additional benefits an additional lift

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,970
for our advertisers to target audiences

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:49,000
so how big is our reach all right

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:54,190
there's a fact NBCUniversal reaches 268

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,080
million people every month now it'll

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,080
probably surprises everybody and that's

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,240
across that whole portfolio it would

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,570
surprise you to know that that's 35

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,479
million more than YouTube and 25 million

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:10,120
more than Facebook and that's not taking

00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:12,100
into account they kind of have a problem

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,979
counting these days in case you haven't

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:20,940
heard right and then counting a lot of

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:24,130
bots not just Russian BOTS so you know

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:27,419
we still reach a tremendous footprint

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,550
right and this is all original content

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:32,320
it's quality content it's content that

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,070
our advertisers want to be associated

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:42,539
with all right so how do we monetize

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:46,840
that so as I mentioned our portfolio

00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:52,360
right it includes 95 percent of the US

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:54,159
population right we have the expansion

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,220
of OTT and app deployments which is

00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:59,409
increasing our interaction right one

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,090
thing I want to ask here and make this

00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:03,669
somewhat interactive and at least

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,490
somewhat entertaining right how many of

00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,400
you are cord cutters right don't have a

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,770
cable subscription all right yeah we

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,289
don't like you know I'm just kidding

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,120
all right you still are consuming our

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:18,849
content you're just doing it in ways

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,889
that you choose to but it's hard for us

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:24,370
to measure that as weird as that sounds

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:26,500
right we're still measuring TV linear TV

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,849
the same way we did guess what

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,690
fifty years ago rights based on about

00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:37,360
was it 40,000 households huh 30,000

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:41,020
households right on a panel and then we

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:46,240
go across all the distribution providers

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:50,050
that gives us the ratings let's see what

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,520
else we have here we have parks so we

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,530
have millions of annual

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,700
visitors to our parks both here in

00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:59,800
California and in Florida right we have

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,620
transaction services through golf now

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,670
and Fandango yes we do have Fandango as

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:09,160
part of our portfolio all right and we

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:12,850
have growing engagements with full films

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,370
DVD sales and much more games you name

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,610
it these all have interactions with

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,650
consumers they're all generating data we

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,170
have to gather all that data into one

00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,690
central place create that 360-degree

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:31,870
view and then give increased value to

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:34,480
our advertisers so audience studio was

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:38,710
set up about two years ago to do exactly

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:42,310
that right I was brought on about a year

00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:46,210
and a half ago - and and by this

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,890
gentleman right here and I was asked you

00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,620
know hey listen we have to build a

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:54,460
state-of-the-art data asset analytical

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:58,510
engine that can allow us to target build

00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,340
these targets and then apply them to any

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,730
of our distribution means this means

00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:05,650
apply them to linear TV right so that we

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:09,010
can generate an optimized media plan

00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:12,790
that's based on data that's not based on

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:15,370
somebody's kids watching a show so you

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:18,610
know and if our advertisers want to come

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,890
to us with their own data great we'll

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,410
plug that in we'll build the audience

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,710
based on that data we'll extend the

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:29,260
audience and then we'll target that

00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:32,740
right and our whole thing is to do it at

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:35,080
scale guarantee doesn't matter how we're

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,310
going to see that consumer it doesn't

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,560
matter where we're going to see that

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,260
consumer so if we if it's on our app

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,870
because the person's a chord cutter fine

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,560
we'll target them will count them we'll

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,560
do all of it

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,240
so this

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,250
what we like to call our ice-cream slide

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,680
it looks like an ice-cream cone but

00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,870
there are three aspects to this right

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,580
there is our national living linear TV

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:06,170
which is what you're mostly familiar

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:09,940
with I define that as you watch the TV

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,950
for the most part when we want you to

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,920
write that's linear TV now there are

00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:18,140
aspects to that where it's time shifted

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,100
or VOD you're still going to see the

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:25,070
same advertisements right but for the

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,980
most part linear TV is defined as you're

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:30,830
gonna watch the show when we want you to

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,470
write then there's addressable TV this

00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:35,780
is after a certain amount of time you go

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,710
to your box you watch VOD you watch your

00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:41,660
OTT apps right but now we can target you

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,960
with custom advertising based on what

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,690
you what are your interest what we know

00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,000
about you and by the way you know you

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,590
know autonomy is the way so they don't

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,870
get you know don't worry about privacy

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,330
we trust me I have to worry about that

00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:00,010
every day right and then we have our

00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:03,470
digital aspects right we and if you look

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:06,020
still vast amounts right on a scale

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,230
there's a hundred and five plus million

00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:11,570
to US television households there's 19

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,300
million addressable households because

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:17,020
not every cable box has the ability to

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,760
be addressable right and then we have

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:27,770
172 million uniques per month on our

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:31,010
desktop and mobile applications we're

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:33,350
putting our money where our mouth is so

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:36,050
this year we announced Linda vaccarino

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,540
who's the head of all of ad sales for

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:43,130
NBC Universal announced and said and

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:45,470
this is pretty unique within the

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,810
industry because this is still this

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,670
whole data analytics driving sales are

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,830
still fairly new in the industry there's

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,839
there's some players that are doing it

00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,480
but we're kind of we believe we're

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,390
taking a leadership position here and so

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:04,040
out of that 10 billion dollars we

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:07,339
allocated 1 billion of that for

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,730
dramatic or data based advertising so

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:12,709
one tenth of our entire sales this year

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,790
and we're well on track to do that and

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:17,149
achieve that goal

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:19,190
all right so it's taken the trade and

00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:21,079
you know in an ad week it actually says

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,839
it's taking the training wheels off of

00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:26,180
audience to do so now we've no longer

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,600
are the the little toy that was kind of

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:34,089
nice and we have to do it at scale right

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,089
we can't just do it and paper it along

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,769
so we have some technology goals right

00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:45,230
we got to unlock and utilize the data

00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:48,139
you would think it was a lot easier we

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:50,690
spend about a you know a couple of days

00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:53,120
here every other month just talking to

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,190
our brands that are here try going down

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,319
the Florida trying to get the data get

00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,630
the data all together everybody's

00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:01,639
individual cost centers and you know

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:07,579
profit centers so this is not an easy

00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:10,670
task right we have to take ownership of

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:13,760
our linear optimization solution we have

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:16,819
to be nimble right this was part of the

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,100
challenge when I came here was we didn't

00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:21,110
really know what was needed this hasn't

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,050
been done before so it's build us a

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:27,110
platform that can take anything and do

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,760
anything right and so you know and you

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,339
can see throughout all of your

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,630
discussions today that these you know in

00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,420
the last two days if you're here for

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:38,660
DCOs days DCOs lends itself to those

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,010
kind of dynamic nimble we don't know

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,889
what we're you know what what the

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:49,579
challenges of tomorrow are going to be

00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:51,410
right let you read the rest of that we

00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:56,290
have several this year of technology

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:59,870
goals so what's our value proposition

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:02,329
we're targeting at scale we'll utilize

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:05,000
our advertisers data we'll utilize our

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:07,279
data we'll combine them we'll do it in a

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,370
privacy safe manner in a manner that's

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,699
fully tenant so that we're not going to

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,990
intermix advertising data right right

00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:16,590
we're going to get better cost

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,480
efficiency

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,060
so you know in the example I started

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,220
with where somebody came in and said I'm

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:27,360
gonna buy The Voice primetime because my

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:30,120
kids like it right well what if I can go

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,130
ahead and save them money and get them

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,770
the same audience across some of our

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,110
cable properties and you say well why

00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,760
would you want to do that

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:43,200
well they'll free up that ad slot right

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,790
for somebody else and then we move that

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,030
off of there and still get them the

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,680
audience so there's there's a win-win

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,240
for everybody they're saving money

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,370
they're still reaching their audience

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,980
we're freeing up the slot maybe we can

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,080
monetize it for more all right there's

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,210
somebody who needs it because the voice

00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,810
happens to hit that demographic really

00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:06,150
well for them all right and then

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,350
inventory insights right again this is

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,710
exactly what I was talking about

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:18,110
shifting across all of our portfolio

00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:20,190
from some of our hot portfolios right so

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,950
anybody noticed the change in the

00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:25,230
production quality right these are my oh

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:31,080
now I always say that you don't hire me

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:38,520
for my PowerPoint so they are absolutely

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:40,730
not your good I like that so essentially

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:46,110
what we're talking about is building a

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:47,910
data Lake right and because this is this

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,740
is kind of loose how you know

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,180
requirements we have we have a whole

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,680
bunch of data from a whole bunch of

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,890
different sources we got to bring it all

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,000
together we've got to analyze it figure

00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:01,890
out what we're going to do with it

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,840
create a target send it out right how do

00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:06,180
you do that but those were centrally the

00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,650
requirements we have into this day to to

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,930
a certain degree what the requirements

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,290
we have so we wanted to go ahead and

00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:17,010
build a data link and as I was looking

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:20,550
at it a little little stuff right I

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:22,470
looked at it and I was you know I wanted

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,910
to go in the cloud I didn't want to be

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,770
on Prem because of some of the

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:29,580
challenges that can be there with some

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,360
of the you know as I have experience

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,960
with on

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,549
premises data data lakes they they

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,410
almost fit you know they have

00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:40,260
difficulties I won't use the term fail

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,390
by their mere success because if your

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,299
on-prem you have limited resources

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:47,429
alright they're they're limited alright

00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:50,340
you know it doesn't matter at some point

00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:52,049
you're running out of spindles and so if

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,330
you you create this data lake and

00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:56,220
everybody jumps on it you quickly have

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,520
these unbounded resources because you're

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,690
usually successful you know requirements

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,450
and you have these very bounded

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:06,000
resources so along comes the cloud right

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,490
cloud solves the problem well you can't

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,669
do it cost effectively because if all I

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,929
do is shift my Hadoop cluster let's be

00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:15,690
honest that's what we're talking about

00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:18,030
here at least on Prem the HDFS and I

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:21,330
move it into the cloud there's a tipping

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:26,520
point in cost all right we can debate on

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:29,160
what that is 200 tera 300 tera but

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,290
eventually it's too expensive all right

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,940
and so I was always thinking about this

00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,040
and this is not earth shattering but

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,169
this was a shift we made about a year

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,520
ago I kind of thought about it and I

00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:43,169
said well you know the problem really

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:46,350
isn't the cloud right the problem is

00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:48,480
that we're taking HDFS in a Hadoop

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,330
infrastructure and moving it into the

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,460
cloud which is really where the cost is

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,340
right those those volumes those spinning

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,160
volumes are expensive right and that's

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,919
what costs you money so we quickly

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,500
shifted over to a s3 as you can tell

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,320
we're an Amazon cloud but all the major

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,120
providers have an object store and we

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,840
just basically shifted over to running

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,240
park' files on s3 it's a cost-effective

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,880
storage solution for us and it's led me

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,780
to believe and Greg over here asked me

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,330
to drop the bomb

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,370
I view honestly with all due respect to

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,190
the to our Hadoop fans is Hadoop is

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:30,690
yesterday's technology right as quickly

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:34,890
as it came all the rage when I have a DC

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:38,210
OS cluster running spark at scale I can

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:41,400
go against an s3 backed right

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,950
Parkay based system which is infinitely

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,620
scalable never runs out

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:49,399
I can do it as a cost-effective way and

00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,200
if we're truly honest with ourselves and

00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:55,289
look at the cost of ownership on Prem

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,200
which is in terms of all the people that

00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:00,299
are there that maintain it the DevOps

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,789
the amount of disks that have to be

00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:05,820
reasonably replaced the support

00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:08,580
contracts we're pretty much on par in

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,669
cost you know from the back of the

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:14,039
envelope analysis I've done quite

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:17,549
honestly I don't want to have to do that

00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:21,210
I'd rather let the provider worry about

00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:24,840
that right same thing with you know D

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:27,269
cos we'll get into I have so many

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,070
challenges within the business I don't

00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:32,580
want to worry about infrastructure I

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:35,279
don't want to worry about you know those

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,279
those spinning volumes I don't want to

00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:40,590
have to have DevOps I want my engineers

00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,510
as many as I can concentrating on

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,120
solving this problem because quite

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,860
honestly we have a big challenge ahead

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,159
of us right

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,990
you know we got we like everybody else

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:58,440
we got Google and Facebook staring us in

00:20:51,990 --> 00:21:00,360
the face right so that's how we solve

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,600
the problem now there's also other

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:08,549
advantages right one of the things that

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,289
I I want to go into here is that there's

00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,200
a couple of things within all data

00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:17,159
solutions and data leaks I can't stand

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,529
copies the data right everybody in an

00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,539
enterprise especially at NBC copies data

00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,429
and they bring it into their own little

00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,049
tool box and they do it for a lot of

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:27,029
reasons number one they can't get the

00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,710
data at the right form you know they

00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:30,899
can't get the data at scale and the way

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,779
they need it so they take a copy and

00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:36,620
they move it right and then they do

00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:40,260
their own transform that's horrible

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:42,269
number two how many of you have ever

00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,360
seen within your data leaks where it's

00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:50,159
like the roach motel data goes in but it

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:53,909
never comes out right and I contend old

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,010
data is worse than no data right so you

00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:57,280
know we can set an expiration date on s3

00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,760
and it just goes away

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,970
right and unless you're really savvy

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,980
with a Hadoop cluster how much of us

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,980
have really implemented multi tendency

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:11,710
and you know user permissions it's

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,800
really at the I got access to the

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:17,080
cluster and now I can see everything

00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:20,290
well within s3 or any object store I can

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,840
control based on policy who sees what

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,790
file and an atomic level I can control

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,130
it by the directory I have all that

00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:29,290
permissioning stuff it's all built in

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,140
and I don't have to do anything other

00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:39,040
than create the policies right so I get

00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:40,330
a lot of advantages here so like

00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,980
everything else even though I've been

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:47,340
spending a lot of time with an audience

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:50,110
studio talking about park' files in s3

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,900
we do have to have other data stores in

00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:55,600
our lake right we do use Amazon redshift

00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,690
that's our only cloud locking technology

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,400
and I contend that it's not it's nothing

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:03,040
more than a Postgres database with a

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,410
calendar based data engine all right I

00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,850
can get that out of Vertica right if I

00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,190
want to pay for it I can get that

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,230
anywhere it just was cost effective to

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,890
do it right and I needed that enterprise

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:18,370
data warehouse to put a GUI in front of

00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:22,150
all right for my ops teams run Postgres

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:24,070
run Postgres because i still have you

00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,950
know relational needs those things don't

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,720
go away guys okay if I'm going to build

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,250
rest services I'm gonna have access

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,190
control I'm going to have these things

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:35,260
there's still we have to relate objects

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,690
together so you utilize what's best for

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,780
it so Postgres exists in our stuff and

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,760
yes we use Cassandra we use Cassandra to

00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,160
go ahead and link in our data digital

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,630
data axe packs so that we actually can

00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:57,310
do the targeting for the digital layer

00:23:48,630 --> 00:24:00,550
alright so part of what I also wanted to

00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:03,160
do when I built out this platform was I

00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:07,390
wanted to do and service all the aspects

00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,730
of the Big Data for the enterprise right

00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,530
custom UI solutions which is what our

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,150
operations teams do right this is

00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,340
typically what we all do we build our

00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,260
rest services we put a UI in front of it

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,590
right and then we give it to our ops

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:23,440
teams right and then all the way up at

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:25,870
the top our engineers and like myself

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,370
and our data scientists who want to

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:32,140
attack the big data at scale right and

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,970
generate the code generate the

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:38,700
algorithms generate the ETLs

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:41,799
right and so the complexity goes up and

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,360
your your amount of model data right at

00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:46,120
the top I'm dealing with the atomic

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,530
level what I wanted to do was build out

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:52,740
an infrastructure that would allow

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:57,070
everybody within the sphere here

00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:59,770
interacting with the atomic data right

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:02,140
and by the way I don't care how you do

00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:04,630
it I'm going to offer you certain what

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,669
tools you use because one of the things

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,990
that that I led me to believe you know

00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:10,570
to believe that a lot of the data

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:13,900
copying happens is because they all have

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,730
their favorite tools at NBCUniversal we

00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:20,820
have a tremendous amount of data

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:26,380
analysts okay and data scientist sort of

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:28,480
okay that are providing huge value to

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,820
our customers they're doing custom

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,770
reports they're doing analytics they're

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,000
doing stuff for our customers they're

00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:39,940
interacting with our clients okay and

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,710
guess what they're not engineers right

00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,710
because first of all we're engineers

00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,780
really shouldn't talk to clients second

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,860
of all you don't want to pay somebody

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,440
like me to do that

00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,330
there's no need to it so these people

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,309
have different to have non engineering

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,309
degrees and they have tool sets that

00:25:54,309 --> 00:26:00,910
they're used to sequel being one of them

00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:02,590
right microStrategy's tableau these

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:05,080
things are not an open source and I know

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:07,179
they may be bad words around here but

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,790
this is the reality of the enterprise

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:15,429
these people are providing critical

00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:17,080
roles that we constantly ignore but they

00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:20,530
still have to do their job so they copy

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,940
the data all right so I want to open

00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,480
this

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:29,870
and allow them through the power of DCOs

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:32,820
and spark to attack that data right at

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:37,040
scale or if they don't want to use that

00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:39,270
if they have their own since I'm on s3

00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,240
let them go ahead if they want to run a

00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:45,810
snowflake don't know why fine

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:49,860
spin it up I'll give you your keys have

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:52,890
at it just utilize the data that's in

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:58,980
the lake if you want to augment it write

00:26:52,890 --> 00:27:01,190
it back out somebody else will use it so

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:05,040
how do we do some of this within D cos

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:08,100
right it's my little data pool all right

00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,440
so raw data comes in every data that

00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,070
comes in to audience studio comes into

00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,520
s3 right it's it lands into our data

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,950
lake the first thing it does is our DCOs

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,820
cluster through our ETL processes kicked

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,770
off by Chronos and stuff pick it up and

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:28,530
immediately transform it into a park a

00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:31,800
file which is an exact match of the

00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:34,800
input data this way I don't want to hear

00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,160
oh I need to get at the end the original

00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,080
data

00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,650
no nobody needs to do that kind of

00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:43,290
string processing right I mean CSV is

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,500
CSV for the love of God all right we can

00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:48,780
all just deal with park' files right get

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,920
a much more efficient view of it if you

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:54,270
need to we can talk right and then we're

00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,880
going to start linking the data together

00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,950
and we're going to start pulling all of

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,350
the aspects of that stuff so that we can

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,960
get that 360-degree view of the consumer

00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:05,820
I talked about earlier and we linked all

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,330
that data and all of those intermediate

00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,430
steps are also written out to s3

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:15,300
and made available to the enterprise to

00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:18,600
attack all right and so then as I

00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,820
mentioned I honestly if you want I'll

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,780
give you access might you being the

00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,610
enterprise to the s3 park a file so you

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,190
can use whatever you want you want to

00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,960
spin up your own stuff in the cloud go

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,120
have at it but I'm also going to go

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,000
ahead I'm going to offer you data as a

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,310
service

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,800
the rest api I'm going to offer you

00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:41,860
audience products and I'm also going to

00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,400
offer you a sequel interface through a

00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:51,790
spark thrift server that we contributed

00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:54,820
to the community that you see here okay

00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:57,670
so you know one of the things that we do

00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,870
this our analytic tool sets we utilize

00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:04,660
Zeppelin notebooks tremendously alright

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:07,030
it's it's it's it is truly a very

00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:10,060
powerful tool but the thing that I

00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:11,710
surprised me the most about Zeppelin all

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:15,490
right I don't know how many of you have

00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:17,410
used it but you you you're shaking your

00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,590
head right it's very powerful tool

00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:22,500
and so people engineers like myself some

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,910
of my data scientists not all of them

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,680
very comfortable with it I'm like

00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,050
sitting there going but wait a minute

00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,150
three lines of code I'll give you the

00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,590
three lines of code you can now attack

00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,240
it with a sequel interface more

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:38,370
importantly I can do in memory outer

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,140
joins God darn it how cool is that and

00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,600
when we go back to that slide about the

00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:46,060
enterprise that may be cool but I

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,010
discovered that although I consider it

00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:51,640
simple it's not simple for people

00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:53,890
without engineering degrees right so

00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,260
that was a real shocker cuz I really

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:59,200
thought through notebooks we had the

00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,730
whole solution solved but we don't so we

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,570
go ahead and we go ahead and we give you

00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:07,600
a gateway I see a thrift server a spark

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:09,940
thrift server through DCOs and now all

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,370
of a sudden I don't care what bi tool

00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,590
you have if it talks sequel plug it in

00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:19,360
and now what we've done with this is

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:22,590
we've opened up the power of spark right

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,680
that kind of big data analytical

00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:28,360
capability or querying to the entire

00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:32,410
enterprise just through that simple

00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,570
enabling technology right and even some

00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,350
of our people like using sequel editors

00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,410
like the beaver

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,770
right I don't care they can have at it

00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:45,100
right and then we have our spark cluster

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:47,200
right it's it's truly been good for the

00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,180
enterprise you know it's it's you

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,190
one of my colleagues today said well you

00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,260
know a lot of the data gets copied

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,690
because it's just inherent everybody

00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,160
wants their own copy and my answer to

00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,650
that was well there are certain things I

00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,620
can't do but I can eliminate the excuses

00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:04,840
right so if you know one of the main

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,680
ones is I have to copy the data because

00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,540
I I don't want I want to use my tool set

00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:17,140
all right I just eliminated that all

00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:18,910
right so now lastly DCOs

00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,390
Greg is finally sitting there going oh

00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:25,720
god he's finally about all right

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:30,400
we run everything on this cluster right

00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:33,880
from our management our CI right our log

00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,790
management through ELQ everything right

00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,510
our compute side sparks Epling play

00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:41,860
Kafka right up until they called me and

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,960
they said hey we want to talk to you

00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,220
because you're running our smack thing i

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,860
with the exception of the a we're

00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,570
running smack and I was like oh we are I

00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,030
didn't know it just seemed logical right

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,250
I think all of us a lot of us came to

00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,530
this conclusion before they named it was

00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:59,260
just natural within the power of the

00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:02,580
engine here and then we have our data

00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:05,290
stores where s3 sits off to the side now

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,850
interesting for the first time and this

00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:10,090
is one of my last slides and then you

00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:13,090
guys can happily go for your booth crawl

00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:16,270
and your drinks you finally see the

00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:19,840
dirty little word hadoo right and you

00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:21,700
just served me go on for the last 30

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,750
minutes about how I don't run I do

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:28,480
I run a very small Hadoop aspect onto my

00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,120
cluster and why is that well I need to

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,150
get my spark history I could write my

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,860
spark history to s3 problem with that is

00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,590
that doesn't give it to me interactively

00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,240
it only writes it at the end of the job

00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:42,340
right so I do need to run a little bit

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,380
of Hadoop cluster within DCOs

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,270
and you know when I was initially

00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,950
talking to some folks at mesosphere they

00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,840
were like yeah that's kind of why we

00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,960
originally put it in there and then it

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,540
kind of grew from there all right so

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,240
that's why we do that and then we have

00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,730
Cassandra we're not really using a lot

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,900
of HBase at this point

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:07,510
so I kind of went through this

00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:09,880
reasonably fast landed the plane in time

00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:12,520
so you don't get upset with me do I have

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:24,700
any questions and did you stay awake

00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:26,110
hopefully you stayed awake go ahead oh

00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,580
yeah they wanted me to know if I want to

00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:32,790
talk to you and I didn't get back where

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,790
we can talk I asked this gentleman I

00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,800
don't you know it's interesting I've

00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:17,860
never really associated with the

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,470
micro-services piece because we're

00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:23,110
fairly new to NBC we being the audience

00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:25,420
to do engineering team and so we're a

00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,250
bunch of digital advertising veterans so

00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:29,110
we've kind of been doing this kind of

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:34,000
technology for a while it's just new to

00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:36,190
TV but absolutely in terms of bottom

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,420
line sales when we commit 1 billion

00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:42,790
dollars 1/10 of our linear sales to

00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,800
being data driven and hence micro

00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:48,940
services driven yeah it's had a direct

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:56,080
effect on the bottom line ok so yeah

00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:59,230
absolutely right on the revenue and and

00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,230
how we des acerra ly how we do things

00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:04,840
right I mean this is a big change for us

00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:07,450
on how we sell advertising I kind of

00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,600
glossed over on it but you know it's

00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:13,180
it's it's hard for an organization when

00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,530
you have that much top-line revenue and

00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,900
you know we increase

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,420
dad sales this year 9% that's been in

00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:23,080
the paper so I can say that okay I have

00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:25,840
to be careful sometimes and and it's

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,940
very easy to rest on our laurels right

00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,310
we're kind of leading the front of this

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,770
because we see the tsunami coming at us

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:34,540
and if we don't change how we're doing

00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:38,050
business right

00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:40,990
instead of that 10 turning into 20 right

00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:43,900
it's gonna turn into 8 and that's not

00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,400
good right I really enjoy working for

00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,240
this company so yeah it has

00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:52,260
revolutionized how we do business

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,260
any other questions yes sir

00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:00,550
excuse me okay we're at about we're just

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:04,000
starting out so we're at about a hundred

00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:07,570
terror or so we've processed data both

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,520
in real time so all of our TT and

00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,830
digital assets come at us in real time

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,590
and then add into that audience graph

00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:18,820
all right and then a large part of just

00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:20,500
the nature of linear TV is its batch so

00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,140
we get a lot of stuff that comes in

00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,630
batch at night and that's really also by

00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,380
the way we're utilizing technology like

00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,720
DCOs

00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,520
really allows us to save money and get

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,120
some cost-effectiveness right because

00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,340
the very nature of what the cluster does

00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,680
changes so much from our nighttime

00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:41,200
overnight batch processing you know the

00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,780
the real-time kind of goes along kind of

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,530
constant state it has its EDS inflows as

00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:50,470
you know people are awake right but you

00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:53,170
know the nature of the of the same stack

00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:55,810
changes at night it's running these you

00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,610
GTL processes stitching all the data

00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:00,040
together that ran together viewership

00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:02,410
data you know when you watch something

00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,260
on your cable box eventually I'll see it

00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:08,110
right if I'm if it's part of some of the

00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,240
providers we deal with by the way in a

00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:12,220
totally autonomous way so ID sir I will

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,210
not know that you're watching whatever

00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:18,070
you're watching okay but it comes into

00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,740
the it comes into the cluster at night

00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,510
and then during the day our data

00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,880
scientists our data analysts are

00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,490
attacking the data providing value to

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,690
our clients so it changes much more into

00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,390
one

00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:33,200
analytical mode and I don't have to have

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:36,420
several clusters to do this I have one

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,240
right so I hope that answers your

00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:50,130
question

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:53,400
any other questions oh yeah oh yeah

00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:56,520
that's that's the guaranteed part yeah

00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,050
yeah we have that we have this bad word

00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,099
in the industry it's called a make Li

00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:04,200
that's when we that's when our optimizer

00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:06,630
okay and our and our forecaster goes

00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,400
oops and we have to make good it's okay

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,020
if we over deliver the audience but if

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,730
we don't if we under deliver the

00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,890
audience and we have to make good on

00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,990
that we don't like doing that so yeah we

00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,010
do have after pacing reports and

00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:22,579
everything else that are made available

00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:25,349
to the clients all right anything else

00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:28,720
well then I do believe it's time for

00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:29,800
booth crawl and drinks thank you so much

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,899
[Applause]
