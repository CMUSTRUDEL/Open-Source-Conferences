	Improving Storage Support in Apache Mesos using CSI - Steve Wong, {code}; Jie Yu & James DeFelice, Mesosphere; & Chakravarthy Nelluri, Diamanti

Mesos currently supports both local and external persistent volumes. However, both of them have some limitations. For instance, local persistent volume support requires tedious setup by operators for additional disks. External persistent volume support does not support dynamic provisioning, and Mesos doesnâ€™t track the resources associated with the external volumes. This makes quota control, reservation, fair sharing almost impossible to implement. Our goal is to improve the experience for both of them. The solution is based on a general resource provider model in Mesos, and a standard pluggable interface when talking to storage platforms. This interface is called Container Storage Interface (CSI). This talk will give you an overview about CSI and the resource provider based solution for storage, and dive deeper into how storage platforms can be easily integrated with Mesos using CSI.
