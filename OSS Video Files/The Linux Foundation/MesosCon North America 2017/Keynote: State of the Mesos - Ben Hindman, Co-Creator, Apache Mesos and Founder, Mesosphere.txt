accept here in North America that we

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,689

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,860
Asia

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,110
I was our second maysa con Asia and it

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,890
was really really impressive we went

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:40,409
from having really to kind of user talks

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,070
that are very first are very for first

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,920
mesas con Asia to over 14 so you had 14

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,049
different you know end users in in Asia

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,210
specifically in China they're using

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,680
Mason in really serious capacity and

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,880
they all gave give presentations about

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,040
what they were doing it was really

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,899
really impressive and humbling to be

00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,520
there and hear from super large

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,259
organizations like China Unicom and

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,210
China mobile talking about how they're

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,310
actually taking advantage of this

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,030
technology internally it was really

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,709
really fun okay a few additions to this

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,020
year we decided to mix up maces Khan a

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,010
little bit so you have a few a few new

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,800
additions

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,700
one is we decide to introduce tracks we

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,709
recognized that a lot of organizations

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,420
sorry a lot of people that were coming

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,980
they were coming for specific interests

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,500
and as we were sort of surveying what

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,520
was happening in the mesas ecosystem we

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,320
thought it'd be much better to really

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,060
split the conference up two tracks so

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,080
there's a couple of tracks that are on

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,600
two days

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,570
that's the smack GPUs an analytics track

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,340
you're gonna hear from lots of people

00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:45,090
that are actually in the field doing

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,980
smack with meso s-- using GPUs running

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,930
lots of analytics there's two whole days

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,870
of that so the tracks on both days

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,459
there's an ops track we're recovering

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,950
everything from storage networking

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,690
monitoring security again there's lots

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,269
of talks around that so we split that

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,530
into two days there's a DevOps track

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:02,760
which is a bit more focused on

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,769
microcircuits

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,070
a P is continuous integration continuous

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:10,260
delivery and that that we're just going

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,100
to be doing today on Thursday and then

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,660
tomorrow

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,220
there's attract some tracks that are

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,100
just tomorrow there's a meso stream

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,500
works track so anybody who's using

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,820
frameworks hacking on frameworks want to

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,560
build their own frameworks there's a

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,540
bunch of presentations around that and

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,640
then there's a maysa internals track

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,840
which is really some of the nuts and

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,110
bolts of some of the new features that

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,340
are being built in in maysa and some of

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,880
the details about how those are being

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,459
built and how they can be consumed we

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,110
also decided to add some longer sessions

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,459
we've gotten some feedback that in some

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,790
presentations people wanted to get even

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,690
more hands-on and they wanted to

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,100
sometimes even be able to use their

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,560
laptops and play around with things

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,430
directly in the the sessions so I'm

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,840
going to do something new this year

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,209
they're really excited about we call it

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,700
a mesas con University their 90-minute

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,470
tutorials they're interspersed without

00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,510
alt without the presentations today so

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,680
there's three of them

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,780
there's my application is ready for

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,100
production now what's I think you're

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,400
going to go through everything from

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:11,340
using health tracks to doing some some

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,260
scaling to there's a to doing monitoring

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,359
there's a bunch of different things

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,250
you're going to do there at 2:00 p.m.

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,370
there's one all-around security boot

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,200
scrapping secure mesas clusters and then

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,289
at 4:00 p.m. there's one around building

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,000
a stateful DCOs service using the sdk

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:30,169
from from mesa sphere so

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,610
again they're about 90-minute sessions

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,960
they might go a little bit over you

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,460
should bring your laptops they'll be fun

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,720
and it's gonna be a presentation but

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,250
there's also gonna be time for you to

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,270
actually get involved and write some

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,600
code and get some stuff actually

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,250
actually running okay and then the last

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,830
edition was we wanted to put together

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,190
these town halls and the basic idea the

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,229
town halls was just a place you know we

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,540
noticed as big community gatherings that

00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:56,660
these mesas cones we typically didn't

00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,729
have a great place for people to just

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,350
get together and talk about the projects

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,000
always they were going to presentations

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,960
and hearing about what was happening but

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,729
there wasn't as much community

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,990
discussion as we really wanted so we

00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:08,240
decided this year to introduce town

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,960
halls there 7:00 p.m. tonight after the

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,320
booth crawl

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,430
they'll be beer there'll be some snacks

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,320
there's gonna be three of them one on

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,660
Apache maysa itself which is also

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,970
covering some networking and storage one

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,419
around DCOs and run around marathon and

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,520
Chronos and so please come to those

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,260
later and and hang out with peers and

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,740
talk about the technologies and and

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,270
discuss anything and everything so I

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,490
wanted to give a big thanks to the

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,680
speakers we've got a ton of different

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,180
speakers this year we just highlighted

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,289
some of the new speakers we have some

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,639
brand new speakers that have never

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,930
actually spoken to Mesa has come before

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,400
and I thought it'd be fun to highlight

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,080
them there's lots of people that

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,030
continue to get involved in the

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,889
ecosystem that can continue to get get

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,210
involved in the product a bunch of new

00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,450
speakers and I think that's really great

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,070
if I missed anybody I apologize we tried

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,020
to make sure we're just capturing the

00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,150
new ones but really really exciting to

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,410
see that all right now for the last

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,940
couple minutes I'll just give a quick

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,440
overview the state of the project where

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,050
we're at and then we'll kick off with

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,849
the rest of Mesa con we've done a ton of

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,830
releases there's been 12 release systems

00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:11,330
last year's mesas con some of you might

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,930
remember that last year the big

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,599
announcement was our 1.0 release we did

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,510
that and since then we've done a 1.1 at

00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,389
1.2 and 1.3 so three minor releases

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,010
since that's a nine patch releases total

00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,810
so the community's been really busy

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,210
working on those patch releases and

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,400
getting those shipped we've added 13

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,740
committer and pmc members since last

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,830
year in a sauce con it's a really really

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:40,099
huge number across tons of organizations

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,510
from IBM to Apple there's there's been a

00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,070
lot of really great contribution

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:47,270
and we've been excited to add those

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,890
members to the group we when I was

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,120
asking the community when is asking some

00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,980
folks for other things that they're

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,240
proud of seeing this is one of the

00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,650
things they mentioned they're excited

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,170
that we continue to have a growth and

00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:00,200
our active members on slack people that

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:03,080
are that are it joining in the

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,670
conversation and the discussion both

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,350
from a development perspective as well

00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,640
as just a user and operations

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,790
perspective so it's great to see that

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,290
that growing as well so I asked a bunch

00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,270

the new and noteworthy stuff and what

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,800
should I talk about and I got this giant

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,510
list and this isn't even all the things

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,950
that I actually heard and of course I

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,870
don't have time to go through all these

00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,240
things but it's been really impressive

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,280
to see the community really doing a ton

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,690
of work in the last year and I thought

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,280
I'd just highlight a couple of them that

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,720
I think are especially interesting and

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,660
and I wanted to share with everyone

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,190
everyone this morning the first the

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,710
first couple of ones are all around

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,690
containerization so containerization and

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,640
meso has been you know something that

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,170
would really we started a long long time

00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,070
ago when the project project first

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:54,620
started in 2009 we actually used Solaris

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,000
zones and projects to do our

00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,780
containerization and we pretty quickly

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,660
used lxc which transitioned from there

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,550
to using C groups and namespaces we

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,170
eventually added support for docker and

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,370
in the last couple of years what we've

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,620
done is we've taken some of that

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,810
original C groups and namespaces work

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,910
that we did and packaged it up into what

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,740
we call the UCR or the Universal

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,930
container run time we had this

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,980
predicament with the project which is we

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,260
were never going to be able to really

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,730
get rid of all the containerization work

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,010
that we'd done in the past because we

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,750
had really large scale users who wanted

00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,150
to continue to use that can that that

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,710
containerization text that we built and

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,150
so we tried had to figure out what's the

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,970
best thing for them when they wanted to

00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,380
do things like say run docker images so

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,900
the universal container runtime it's

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,620
pretty cool it's the original

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,530
containerization code that was in May

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,650
sews but now you know you can run

00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,600
containers with a docker image with an

00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,340
app see image there's code out there for

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,050
an OC eye image or you can run

00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,280
containers as was before the days of

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,410
docker without an image at all

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,340
whatsoever so this is pretty fun for

00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,080
organization

00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,520
that aren't necessarily moving to

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,460
something like docker but still want to

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,290
get the benefits of containers and

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,120
container orchestration they can

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,130
directly leverage the leverage the the

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,180
the UCR to do that and there's a lot of

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,980
organizations that are doing that

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,570
they're just taking their zip files or

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,400
they're taking their tar balls or taking

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:17,270
other things in there they're launching

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,680
them launching their containers okay you

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,150
know one of the really cool things that

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,890
we were able to do because we have this

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,630
containerization stuff built into

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:28,910
directly to to may sews is stuff around

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:31,490
nested containerization so we actually

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,960
built arbitrary nested containerization

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,350
what's that lets you do it lets you

00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,370
create arbitrary nested containers you

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,460
know an outer container an inner

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,930
container an inner container you know

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,940
you can launch a container that starts

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,130
from a zip file it can actually then

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,780
launch a container which is comes from a

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,460
docker image that might potentially

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,710
launch a container which comes from an

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,930
OC eye image and there's lots of really

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,550
really great applications to this the

00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,890
two big ones that we're excited about

00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,510
are things like Jenkins when you want to

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,920
run Jenkins Jenkins itself might be

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,810
launching containers you want those

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,790
containers to be contained

00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,010
you know if Jenkins happens to die you

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,230
don't want the orphan containers to be

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,090
running around in the in the on your

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,230
machine and the other the other one

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,660
which we're excited about which I hear a

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,980
little bit more about later is for

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:21,170
running kubernetes on top of on top of

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,420
DCOs and meso s-- where again we can do

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,010
that in a way where our top-level

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,720
containers don't actually need to be

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,010
privileged they can just use

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,320
capabilities so it's been really really

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,840
cool to see this this this tech evolved

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,640
in meso s-- as part of that we added

00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,770
support for container attach and

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,930
container exec there's lots of

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,790
interesting stuff there but this is

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,530
really then driving a bunch of work that

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,720
we're excited about which is standalone

00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,450
containers which is just going to be the

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,730
ability to run containers not through

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,590
the typical maysa api is but just any

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,420
standalone containers especially daemons

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,220
which has been a huge request from from

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,080
the community for a long time as to

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,910
better support deem daemons

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,320
so lots lots of great work in

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,320
containerization that's that's really

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,520
building up to a bunch of these features

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,160
the other area that I wanted to touch on

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,200
briefly related to containerization is

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,580
networking and storage

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,570
this is one of the areas where I'm

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,280
really really proud of the Mesa

00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,500
community because they've really taken a

00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,530
leadership effort along with a bunch of

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,060
organizations around this you know the

00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,950
two big focus areas for us have been

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,620
around C&I The Container networking

00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,450
interface and CSI the container storage

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,880
interface and I just wanted to give a

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:33,890
shout out to GU and Jay def for doing a

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,140
great job really helping to drive

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,990
forward the containers to this storage

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,790
interface this is super tough tough work

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,360
in the industry to actually make changes

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,620
like this across vendors and and

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,420
end-users and it's been really really

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,630
impressive and fun to have the project

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,830
to be writing in the the midst of it all

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,240
okay I mean one of the things that I'm

00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,040
especially excited about when it comes

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,560
to the storage work that we're doing is

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,840
we're finally building out support for

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,090
what we've called local and external

00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,190
resource providers these are third-party

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,440
resource providers that can expose new

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,570
kinds of resources can deal with the

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,580
allocation of those resources the quote

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,930
of those resources so forth and so on

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,790
we've talked about this for a long time

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,070
in the project and it's becoming a

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,570
reality system specifically around

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,660
storage so you know what does this

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,820
really mean for you guys it means better

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,960
integration with third-party storage it

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,420
means better integration with

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,580
third-party networking and you'll start

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,640
to see that pretty early on as the work

00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:34,580
around CSI is is really enabling LVM

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,620
local storage as well as a network

00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,940
attached storage and in a much cleaner

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,820
way than we've been able to do it in the

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,020
past okay the last one I really wanted

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,310
to highlight because I think it's it's

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,870
really great to see is all the work

00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,450
we've been doing around multi-tenancy I

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,070
looked last year at the slide the slides

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,750
that I presented and that's when we

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,910
first talked about quota so we just

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,590
introduced quota last year and this year

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,770
we've we've improved that to not only

00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:59,060
have quota but have hierarchical quota

00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,620
hierarchical fair share as well as this

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,240
concept we call hierarchical

00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,890
reservations a really reservation

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,380
refinement so this is really really

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,660
powerful stuff most organizations are

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,240
hierarchical in nature and by adding

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,760
this we've really enabled organizations

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,560
to delegate these things to have

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,710
isolated visibility into these things

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,060
it's all authorized and soon frameworks

00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,410
like marathon and I hope others will

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,850
actually be able to take advantage of

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:27,000
these primitives

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,680
than themselves alright so I kind of

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,510
wanted to end one last slide I hadn't

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,740
really done this in the past but I

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,240
thought it would be fun to just make

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,180
some predictions about perhaps what we'd

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,980
see in 2018 these are a little bit

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,420
random but perhaps they're also my pet

00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,460
peeves I'd love to see this stuff done

00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,010
one is we're really excited to see a

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:47,070
more work around preemption we've we've

00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:50,040
introduced the concept of revocable

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,020
resources in the past into maysa but

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,940
we're not using it as pervasively as we

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,310
really wanted to so I'm excited to see

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,870
in 2018 I think you'll see revocable

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,590
resources being sort of a front and

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:04,170
center feature in maysa I think we'll

00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:10,830
probably see the end of zookeeper which

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:12,180
I think yeah ok there we go yeah there's

00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,340
been a bunch of work around either

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,690
replacing it with something else and I

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,070
think actually in the future what we'll

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,860
see is just nothing you'll just be able

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,450
to launch maysa without any of those

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,530
third-party components and it's just

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,300
gonna be one less component have to

00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,680
manage and I think the last one is

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,990
there's been a lot of talk from a bunch

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,550
of people about extending the agent the

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,110
launching and containerization to not

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,090
just work with images but also work with

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,030
virtual machines so there's a bunch of
