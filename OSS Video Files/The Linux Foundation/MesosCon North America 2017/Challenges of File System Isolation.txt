	Challenges of File System Isolation - Santhosh Kumar Shanmugham, Twitter

Twitter use Apache Aurora on Apache Mesos to provide a scalable cluster that is used by the engineers to run their microservices. The platform has seen dramatic adoption due to the deploy features provided by Aurora, which is appealing to the engineers and the resource isolation features provided by Mesos, which improves the cluster utilization. At Twitter we use isolation of CPU, Memory, Disk and Network bandwidth to provide guaranteed access to resources for application running inside a container. One of the glaring exceptions of the container isolation is the lack of file system isolation. To this end we experimented with enabling Docker containers inside Twitter to provide an isolation layer between the host and the container. In this talk we will share our experiences at an attempt to using Docker at scale and the lessons we have learned along the journey.
