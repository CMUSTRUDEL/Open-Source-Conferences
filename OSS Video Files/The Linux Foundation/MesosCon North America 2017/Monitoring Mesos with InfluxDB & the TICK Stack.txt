Description: 
	Monitoring Mesos with InfluxDB & the TICK Stack - Paul Dix, InfluxData & Tehmasp Chaudhri, Oracle Data Cloud

In this presentation, Paul Dix will introduce the open source TICK stack, a complete solution for monitoring infrastructure, applications, network, and services. Based on InfluxDB, the open source time series database, the other components of the stack provide everything a developer or operator needs to collect, store, monitor, and visualize monitoring and telemetry data from DC/OS and services and applications deployed within it. Paul will go through an end-to-end example showing how to get full visibility in your infrastructure using nothing but open source tools and software.
