Description: 
	State is Hard: An SDK for Building Stateful Applications - Gabriel Hartmann, Mesosphere, Inc.

Apache Mesos and DC/OS are powerful tools to manage, deploy, and maintain services. But, rolling your own stateful application on top of DC/OS requires a deep understanding of Apache Mesos primitives and DC/OS components. Enter the DC/OS SDK.

From a birdâ€™s eye view, most stateful systems look quite similar. Kafka, Cassandra, HDFS, Elastic and the rest of Big Data systems all have their own very specific concerns, but fundamentally they all need to: 

The DC/OS SDK codifies the 95% of code that is shared between most services, standardizing how those services interact with Mesos. 

In this talk, we will present an overview of the interface and briefly demonstrate how to write a service. We'll also present deep dive on the the internal design and implementation of services.
