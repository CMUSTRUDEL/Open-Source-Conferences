Description: 
	API Gateway Pattern & Kong in a Microservices World - Marco Palladino, Mashape

Kong (https://getkong.org/) is the most widely adopted OSS gateway for APIs and 
Microservices. Built on top of Lua and NGINX, Kong can is a high-performance 
gateway that can be elastically deployed behind the firewall to secure, protect 
and extend RESTful APIs and Microservices via Kong Plugins.

In a container world APIs are becoming increasingly more important as a
communication medium - inside and outside the firewall. The more services are 
being created, the harder it gets to efficiently secure, manage and extend them 
in a variety of environments, in singe or multi-DC setups.

API gateways can be used to centralized common functionality in one place, by 
providing a highly performant, extensible and lightweight layer for both 
internal and external services, including serverless functions.
