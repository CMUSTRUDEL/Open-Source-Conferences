Description: 
	Doing “DropBox” the Cloud Native Way - Jorg Schad, Mesosphere

Cloud Native architecture has slowly become the default way to build robust, scalable applications. How would you rebuild a large scale storage service such as Dropbox (please note Dropbox is just an example here and we have no plans of actually competing with Dropbox), using the Cloud Native architecture? In this presentation, Joerg and Nitish will discuss the Cloud Native architecture, its advantages, and then explain how to build a scalable, multi-tenant, Dropbox like cloud storage system using modern, containerized applications like Minio as the unstructured data/blob store, MongoDB for structured data, Redis for key value pairs etc, all orchestrated on DC/OS. The presentation will also include a live demo of the Dropbox equivalent product.
