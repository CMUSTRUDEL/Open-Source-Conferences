Description: 
	OpenWhisk as an Apache Mesos Framework - Tyson Norris & Dragos Dascalita Haut, Adobe Systems, Inc.

OpenWhisk is quickly gaining momentum as a serverless platform, where function developers can deploy their executable code (or even docker containers), without having to manage builds or servers or monitoring or all the things required to host a conventional web application. To date, it has not been possible to leverage the cluster-wide scheduling facilities for running functions via OpenWhisk. We will present a Mesos framework for efficiently leveraging cluster resources for use by OpenWhisk functions, and trace the evolution of this framework from web application, to Mesos framework, and finally to DC/OS package based on dcos-commons.
