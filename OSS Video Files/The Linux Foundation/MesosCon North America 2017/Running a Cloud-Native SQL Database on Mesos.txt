Description: 
	Running a Cloud-Native SQL Database on Mesos - Ben Darnell, Cockroach Labs

Compute management solutions like Mesos have rapidly advanced in recent years, but storage options have been left behind. Conventional SQL databases still require mountains of development and operational overhead to keep them functional as scale and availability requirements grow. What could be possible if a strongly-consistent database built specifically for cloud-native deployments paired with a powerful orchestration system like Mesos? 

This talk will look at how to deploy and manage CockroachDB, a scalable and strongly-consistent database, using sophisticated orchestration tools like Mesos. We will explore the ease with which CockroachDB was configured to run on Mesos using the new DC/OS SDK for stateful services, which saved days of writing code. We will then explore how you can deploy CockroachDB on Mesos to ship scalable, resilient applications on any cloud infrastructure.
