Description: 
	DataStax Enterprise on DC/OS - Yes, It’s Possible; Customer Case Studies - Ravi Yadav, Mesosphere & Kathryn Erickson, DataStax

Migrating a database to a containerized infrastructure brings with it a whole host of challenging new issues. Concerns range from persistence management, availability requirements, and complicated recovery semantics. If you’re considering migrating a database to containers in the future, this talk should enlighten the path.

We will walk you through the current state of the DataStax Enterprise framework. We'll explore the details of the integration between DSE and DC/OS and cover tradeoffs between different deployment options. We’ll tell the real story of the evolution of this framework. In doing so we’ll discuss how our initial design decisions conflicted with customer expectations and how we worked through these and other engineering feats to get to the offering we have today. We'll then tell a few customer deployment stories and conclude with a demo of DSE on DC/OS.
