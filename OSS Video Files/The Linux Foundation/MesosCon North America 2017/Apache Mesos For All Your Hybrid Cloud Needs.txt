	Apache Mesos For All Your Hybrid Cloud Needs - Imran Shaikh, YP

Hybrid cloud is bigger than ever. The demand is skyrocketing especially after the outage of a leading public cloud provider earlier in the year. It served us a reminder that moving to the cloud does not absolve us from the responsibility of business continuity and disaster recovery planning of our apps. Unfortunately, none of the solutions that are out there lets you run a hybrid cloud setup with ease. They are still: first generation, difficult to install, operate or administer. Whatâ€™s needed is an extremely flexible and a highly scalable model to run modern applications across on-premise data centers, private or public clouds. Lots have change with the advent of containers, serverless architectures, message queues, IoT, CI/CD and big data jobs. At YP, we have leveraged Mesos to run all kinds of workload with ease while retaining full flexibility and better business continuity planning.
