	Keynote: Are We There Yet? - Ross Gardler, Executive VP, ASF and Principal Program Manager, Azure Container Service, Microsoft

Orchestration of workloads is a hot topic. Everywhere we look there are opinions. All orchestration options claim to be the best, all options have their limitation. We listen to conference presentations that tell us how Company Foo has had amazing results with solution X and that they would never use solution Y, but the very next session tells us that equally impressive results have been achieved with solution Y and they'd never use X. What are we supposed to choose? Who are we supposed to listen to? In Azure Container Service we've been offering a choice of solutions to our customers for some time. What has this taught us about orchestration technology? What does the future look like? Who is the clear winner? [Spoiler alert: no clear winner but there are clear success stories for each offering.]
