If you are building applications today, you are probably using either cloud or Kubernetes … or both! As a result, we are entering an era that we don’t have to make complex architecture decisions by weighing tradeoffs on scale, uptime, and usability. Patrick McFadin has been building and supporting scale applications for a long time and has seen all the evolution that has brought us to today. Engineer to engineer, Patrick wants to show you his journey into this world and what he’s been doing at DataStax and the Apache Cassandra project to help make it a reality.
