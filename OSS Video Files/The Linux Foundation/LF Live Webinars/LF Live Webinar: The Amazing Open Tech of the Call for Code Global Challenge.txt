	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
so uh i work i worked for ibm

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
and we launched this program together

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,639
with other partners so it's not just an

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,800
ibm

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,799
initiative initiative uh it's in

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,960
partnership with linux foundation

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,320
the united nations human rights office

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,400
and david clarke cause

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,439
he's a fellow that helps rally eminent

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,199
individuals

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,760
uh to raise awareness of important

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,119
issues whether that's global health

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,840
uh disaster response or veterans issues

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,279
so we have a great ecosystem of partners

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,559
in call for code

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,239
and we what we like to consider about

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,079
call for code that sets it apart from

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,239
other tech for good initiatives

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,520
is that there is support for the top

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,320
winning teams

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
to deliver their solutions not only get

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,960
recognized in the competition with the

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
cash prize

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,440
but also to get mentorship so their

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,520
project can develop sustainable open

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,199
source communities that are very vibrant

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,120
that have users and contributors from

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,120
across the world

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
and so now that we've entered our fourth

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,640
year of the global competition

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,559
uh we've got some great technology to

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,119
show you from past winners

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,080
and we also have a whole bunch of other

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,840
call for code

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,840
solutions that are in various states of

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,600
maturity uh either as a

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,880
linux foundation projects with the call

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,640
for code umbrella

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,600
or ones that are just rapidly innovating

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,520
today

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,439
that you can observe and kind of keep

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,799
tabs on for when we invite contributors

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,159
to those projects

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,080
but we do have a bunch of them they

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,040
cover all sorts of technology

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,439
so whether you're interested in

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,240
artificial intelligence internet of

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,040
things

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,880
data science web applications serverless

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
mobile applications

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,159
there's usually a problem area or

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
technology

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,960
that can appeal to just about anybody

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
who's interested in open source

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,520
technology

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,759
so over the years we've had almost half

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,040
a million developers take part either in

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
the multi-month

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,159
single yearly global competition or

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,079
through some of our

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,840
other initiatives together with linux

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,240
foundation and other partners

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,880
to take on specific issues uh things

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,439
that we call

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,960
spot challenges and those are issues

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,320
that arise outside the global

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,800
competition

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,479
so if you are familiar with golfer code

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,239
you may have associated it with certain

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,080
competitions but be aware there's more

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,680
to it than just that

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,800
and we've had participation from around

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,040
the world 179 nations so far

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,879
and um i don't think we expand too too

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,319
much farther than that but

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,920
there are developers that are new to the

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,120
competition have been involved in the

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,400
competition

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,920
and we're really excited to see that

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,959
growing community that international

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,879
community

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,200
which is a really key important thing

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,879
about open source

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,280
now we did launch in 2018 our focus then

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,280
was on preparing responding to and

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,400
recovering from disasters

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,239
uh mainly the natural sort um

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,920
and we have over the years had other

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
themes come through

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,200
so some of the applications are focused

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,160
on those areas other focused on

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,200
different

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,680
challenges but the first year we focused

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,080
on

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,000
natural disasters project owl was the

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,879
team that created an emergency mesh

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,040
network

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,200
something that was cheap and easily

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,120
deployable after disaster

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,720
inspired by what happened in puerto rico

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
after hurricane maria

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,760
where some folks didn't have network

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,640
connectivity restored

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,080
until almost nine months later power

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,879
sometimes that's easier to get

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,400
better and back online easier but

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,000
network communications

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,159
after the fact as well as during the

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,400
emergency are very important to be done

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,599
and to deploy that quickly in a way that

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
um folks can

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,760
have access to that technology very

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
important so project owls technology was

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,720
open sourced

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,080
as the cluster duct protocol i'll talk

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,519
about a little bit more detail

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,720
later uh the following year's winner

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,519
pro mateo they also took on a solution

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,519
for

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,519
mitigating the effects of disasters in

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599
particular looking at wildlands

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,760
firefighters they're battling wildfires

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,439
in spain uh in australia in argentina

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,159
in the united states in the united

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,000
states and elsewhere around the world

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,439
so we've been working with them also to

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,920
bring their technology to the open

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,480
source

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,319
community athletics foundation and our

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,959
third global challenge winner uh they

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,280
won

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,879
uh they were recognized uh late last

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,040
year and we've been working with them to

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,440
take their solution

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,959
to the open source community as well so

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,959
their solution

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,800
was in response to the call for code

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
global challenge prompt around climate

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,280
change

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
so we in the first couple of years we

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,040
looked at the symptom of disasters

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,120
and in the last couple of years

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,199
including this year we focused more on

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,440
climate change and the issues driving

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,080
disasters

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,600
last year was a very unique year we had

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,880
the pandemic so we launched an

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,040
additional track

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,080
for the social and business aspects of

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,600
the pandemic

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,520
how can you create technology for

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
emergency communications

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,720
for community cooperation remote

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,600
education

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,680
social distancing so another project

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,000
that was was a great piece of innovation

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,039
built on open source technology

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,440
including cloud foundry uh react native

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,919
for

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,039
um uh targeting android as well as

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,039
iphone devices

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,479
uh was an application that's um still in

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,680
development and test

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,759
but it's out there if you've heard of it

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,199
it's available as a web application for

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,160
anybody to use today

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,600
and that's that's called safe queue uh

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,479
also very important

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,280
starting last year around this time

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,639
there was a

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,199
large um emphasis around how do we

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,400
handle

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,000
the impacts of racial injustice is there

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
a way that technology can make a

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,440
difference

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,560
can be used in such a way to drive more

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,720
equality

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
so another program is call for code for

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,000
racial justice

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
and within that program we have seven

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,960
open source projects

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,960
uh where folks can learn about a

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,840
particular issue under one of three sub

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,680
themes

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
and look at ways that they can get

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,120
involved in those communities as users

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,280
of the technology

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,280
or to contribute to them as well

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,479
now i mentioned earlier that what sets

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,919
call for code apart is this idea that

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,960
it's not just about

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,039
putting a project prompt out there or

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,880
inspiring people to go use technology to

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,960
go win a competition

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,560
with call for code there is the global

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
challenge prize money which i'll talk

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,840
into

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
a little bit more detail later there is

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,160
that

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,840
mentorship and best practices provided

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,560
by the linux foundation

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,080
ibm assigns an ibm service core

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,240
volunteers from the company

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,840
across the world who are experts in

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,160
hardware software

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,199
branding marketing logo design user

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,600
experience

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,400
all those sorts of things come together

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,360
to support

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,199
the top projects and uh eventually what

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,479
they do is graduate out into some sort

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,240
of sustainability

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,319
why is it either as a startup that's

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,240
built a business around technology

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,080
or if it's an ngo a non-government

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,919
organization a non-profit

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,479
that is creating something core to their

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,160
mission or maybe it even becomes part of

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,479
an enterprise

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,840
company's product line but is based on

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,400
open source

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,199
so the call for code competition is

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,759
really about

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,039
the idea creation uh we also have a

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,479
deployment framework and this is where

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,360
the linux foundation is incredibly

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,919
important

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,280
is it helps us develop an ecosystem of

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,240
partners who can help improve the

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,880
technology provide

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,919
feedback provide expertise and we take

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,919
it from

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,960
being raw innovation at the competition

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,280
period

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,039
we work it through improving

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,720
non-functional functional requirements

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,199
making it easier to use

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,560
considering different use cases and we

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,479
test it out in the field

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,599
in in covid we actually did go to puerto

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,599
rico with project owl

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,919
um or uh testing for mateo with

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,680
firefighters

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,840
or uh working with farmers in the case

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,440
of agri-lee so that's very important

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,280
that these projects

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,560
are not only inspired to build amazing

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
innovation but

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,440
before they're opened up to larger

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,240
contributions from the open source

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,360
community

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,319
that we validate the core functionality

00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,919
of the project

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,360
so that when we invite folks through

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,840
linux foundation model

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,120
to take part there's really clear ways

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,240
to get involved

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,720
and to deploy it on your own where you

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,560
might

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,720
want to have it take on a challenge in

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,479
your own area

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,120
and finally implementation so we have a

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,599
lot of great teams out there that

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,240
can give you kind of feedback on their

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,879
experience

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,560
as well as help you use that technology

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,680
and mentor you in turn to create your

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,680
amazing innovation

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
on top of those open source projects

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,440
so i mentioned call for code ibm's the

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,599
founding

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,959
partner so we provide the technology uh

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,360
the united nations and other

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,120
un organizations help us formulate the

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
prompts tie them back to sustainable

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,320
devils

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,320
um but really uh the important part of

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,600
linux involvement here is

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,760
if you go to linuxfoundation.org

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
look up the projects you'll see that we

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,000
have an umbrella

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,000
it's called call for code with linux

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,160
foundation easy enough

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,120
and you can see the current list of 12

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,959
projects

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
that are neutrally hosted right now

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,480
linux foundation

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,240
and by going to that page you can dive

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,120
into either the generic call for code

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,959
slack

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,720
which has channels for each of the the

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,160
teams the the the supporting

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,200
organizations behind these open source

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,399
projects

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
and you can drive into the github

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,480
organization as well so some of them

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,080
are hosted under a call for code

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,040
i'm sorry github.ibm.com call dash

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,000
for dash code others have expanded out

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,279
to include

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,920
more repos they're in different

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,120
organizations but if you go here

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,640
this is where you can learn about the

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,760
ones that are official projects ready

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,600
for contributors

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,279
as well as ones that are working through

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,360
that maturity

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,360
incubating funnel right now

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,399
there is also a parallel organization

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
for the call for code for racial justice

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,560
projects

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
it has it's a whole set of other related

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,839
repositories

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,000
including links back to the cncf's

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,160
inclusive naming initiative

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,440
so you can learn about the technology

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,160
there we do

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,040
also as ibm provide on our developer

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,279
website

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,040
a way to understand these projects a

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,480
little more depth we've got videos we've

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,800
got interviews

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,320
we've got other documentation where you

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,680
can learn about the story of how these

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,360
projects were created

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,279
and you can dive in and contribute to

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,680
them in

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,279
in github as well and there are links in

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,720
in all of these repos

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,000
to uh slack and also so you can see some

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,079
of the licensing details

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,959
the linux foundation focus is on apache

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,560
too so most of these are apache2 license

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,079
except for maybe they they build upon

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,200
additional data sets things like that

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,200
that are differently licensed

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,959
and whatever you don't find in in github

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,079
we normally have something on ibm

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,640
developer

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,200
that addresses one of three types of

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,480
users of that open source technology

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,959
if you just want to learn about the

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,320
technology understand the issue

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,800
and potentially just consume it in your

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,880
own

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,399
text such as understanding how a mesh

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,040
network works that you want to put one

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,279
together

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,120
you want to hold the skills and iot to

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,040
to go do that yourself

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,800
we've got materials for that on ibm

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,320
developer

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,279
you can learn about the specific

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,200
projects and how you might get involved

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,959
uh what what they're trying to solve

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,279
what they're not trying to solve

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,120
and hands-on with the technology and

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,880
finally uh they all have contribution

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,640
guidelines that adhere to the best

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,240
practices from the linux foundation so

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,240
they include a code of conduct

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,240
uh they include some details on how we

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,040
handle pull requests how to respond to

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
issues

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,200
and who the technical steering committee

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,920
members are behind each of the projects

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
so the decision makers who will guide

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,760
them through the projects

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,279
and contact to learn more about the pro

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,240
and potentially earn your way into

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,440
committer ship

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,440
in each of the projects

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,160
so now that you understand um the the

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
general structure of a call for code is

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,560
in some of the ways that we handle the

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,440
innovation let me dive into a few of

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,360
our specific examples of technology has

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,800
been generated by the competition

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,600
as well as things that have evolved

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,240
since so to do that let me start with

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,000
the first year's global challenge winner

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,360
uh it was a team that submitted for the

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
challenge which is focused on natural

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
disasters

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,600
how do you prepare for respond to and

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
recover from them

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,959
and what project owl did was they built

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,240
a

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,320
way to deploy really cheap iot devices

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,800
quickly cheaply throughout an area

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,800
that's dealing with the natural disaster

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,079
something that can not replace

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,079
infrastructure

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,519
or not the commercial projects that were

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,000
out there beforehand

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,120
but things that provide a niche where

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,240
they can comp

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,160
and provide a quick solution so

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,120
this is not a major infrastructure for

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,360
the internet you're not going to run

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,200
broadband over their mesh network

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
it's not something that would take weeks

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,839
to deploy

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,240
such as a satellite or weather balloon

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,040
sort of solution and what they created

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,519
was a

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,880
set of assembling mesh nodes that use

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,040
long range radio

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,160
to connect with themselves assign their

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,240
own roles

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,680
in a mesh network and was to be

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,600
connected with

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,560
solar and um um

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,160
sorry solar and other activity so that

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,320
in case there is no infrastructure they

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,959
can still operate as their own

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,680
uh basic network and what really sets

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,600
this apart

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,240
too in the context that they developed

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,760
it is it provides engineers

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,399
that they can access that's from a

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,800
mobile device without having to download

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,240
a specific app essentially what they've

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,079
done that's really innovative

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,279
is they take advantage of the built-in

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,120
captive portal

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,720
that is in mobile devices that thing

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,440
that prompts you to join

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,480
um that works at a hotel or or at a

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,079
coffee shop

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,920
things like that and they use that they

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,839
provide their interface through that

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,839
um so it's providing a password and

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,240
details to join a network

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,440
you're actually on that to send

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,560
information over it

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,639
in a unique way so they've uh they

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,720
call for code they open source their

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,519
core mesh network technology

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
as the cluster duct protocol and as a

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,880
startup they

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,560
continue to build software as a service

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,760
around the dashboard for understanding

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
the messages that are coming through the

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,480
system

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
as well as how folks can best respond to

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,440
that as a commander

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,360
in a disaster uh they've got some really

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,720
great documentation put together now

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,079
that they've built out their community

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,320
from the innovation

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,440
through to different ways to deploy

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
different types of networks in different

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,839
situations

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
so you can learn a lot about what their

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,760
naming

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,680
is for the ducks that form different

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,120
roles in the mesh network you can learn

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
how to run it on different types of

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,839
hardware

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,040
beyond just the esp32 boards that they

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,399
started with

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,839
and in fact they've got some great

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,279
stories too around some of the testing

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,800
they've done

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,120
long-range radio has a certain

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,639
terrestrial distance it's affected by

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,560
things that radio is concrete and

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,320
humidity and altitude and

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,560
topography but they've done some really

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,160
interesting stuff in terms of

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,199
merging this with satellite solutions by

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,760
launching some weather balloons to do

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,199
laura over really long distances up at

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,839
certain levels of the atmosphere so

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,279
really a vibrant community a great set

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,040
of folks to get involved with

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,120
and people are using this technology in

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,880
lots of different ways um

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,480
the students from california polytechnic

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,040
institute are using it for

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
uh that that upper atmosphere testing uh

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,160
you've got folks that are using it to

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,839
manage their vineyards in california

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,360
and you've got folks obviously testing

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,240
it and having ownership of the

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,079
technology

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,639
in puerto rico itself where it was

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,440
originally developed

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,839
and um setting them on this this journey

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,839
is

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,199
that as a top call for code global

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,720
challenge winner

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,639
we connected them with public and

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,160
private partners in puerto rico

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,920
we based ourselves at one of the great

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,639
innovation iot labs there called

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,880
engine 4 and had them test their

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,959
technology in various conditions

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,560
that represented the hardest hit areas

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,639
by hurricane maria

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,680
so testing on very humid um beach

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,240
conditions

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,959
dense concrete built up areas around san

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,880
juan

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,560
as well as in mountainous regions in the

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,160
middle of the island in konoreal where

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,680
there's lots of valleys and they had the

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,240
hardest challenges with network

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,440
connectivity restoration and other areas

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,839
around the island

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,320
and so this testing process

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,600
folks that we assembled to help them

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,639
they continued

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,680
to test their technology and

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,519
test it in various locations as well as

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
provide a way for stakeholders on the

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,320
island to have an ownership stake in

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,560
that tech

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,240
to learn the skills to maintain or

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,399
recreate these notes

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,920
and it's really a great story about this

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,079
is there are students involved

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,959
that are learning tech skills iot skills

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,360
open source

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,320
um technology web application dashboard

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,120
technology

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,680
uh and also having ownership and a stake

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,759
in

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,680
this potentially life-saving technology

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,560
so there's about 30 nodes on the island

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,199
today

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,320
all continuing to emit back data

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,639
solar-powered

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,920
connected satellites some of them a way

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,880
to

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,839
test out the technology for future

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,839
incidents

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,520
uh let's see and so if we look back at

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,760
the

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,520
uh the 2020 year review uh there's been

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,640
some great innovation this year as well

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,760
in the call for code

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,439
community around um project owl but uh

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,039
really it's it's about understanding

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,720
um from that announcement from their

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,319
open source project last year

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,160
to where they've grown what they've done

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,520
to refactor the technology with the help

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,320
of the unit with the open source

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,440
community

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,520
including making their network more

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,559
reliable making it

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,559
more full as well as improving

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,000
and uh making more efficient their their

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,280
message format that they're sending

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,360
along the network

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,120
so uh really uh they're they're really

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,320
looking for additional developers to

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,400
take it forward

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,520
you can learn about it at

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,840
cluster.protocol.org also

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,280
linked from the linux foundation page

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,240
and take a look at some of the open

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,080
issues

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,679
take a look at that documentation and

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,919
dive right into that community

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,679
i know one of the um the really big

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,840
things that they're looking to

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,280
improve is how you can independently

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
test this without necessarily having

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,480
access to hardware

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,559
so for those interested in simulating

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,280
mqtt messages

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,720
building dockerized solutions

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,200
containerized solutions those are

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,280
definitely

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,600
things that you could contribute to

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,600
today

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,440
okay so let's look at the 2019 winner

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,520
this was a team of developers from spain

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
a team of five folks that's the limit of

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,559
people that can be on a team and call

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,520
for capone and working with the global

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,720
challenge

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,760
it included a phd engineer she was

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,720
accompanied by a

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,520
data scientist a full stack an iot

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,039
developer

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,600
as well as a nurse and a firefighter

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,679
within their team called pro mateo so it

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,120
showed that the open source community

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,640
really benefits from the collaboration

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,080
of people with all sorts of skills and

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,919
experiences

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,679
and that will help them be successful by

00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,799
identifying who the end user of their

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,240
innovation was

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,039
and being able to tell that story of why

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,679
this

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,039
technology was was important uh why it

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,600
hit a real need

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,720
and how can be adopted particularly

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,360
within that fire department in spain

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,799
so their solution is based on kubernetes

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
and it is something that we're open

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,520
sourcing

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,600
um very soon as a differently named

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,919
project from mateo will be the startup

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,440
all was but the project will be mutually

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,640
owned under a different

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,520
name and what they created was also iot

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,039
related

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,600
and what what it did was when wildfires

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,039
uh firefighters go out into the field um

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,000
and normally they do much of their work

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,240
actually during prescribed

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,360
burns controlled burns that are planned

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,120
in advance

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,480
and so what they do is they select a

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,320
piece of um

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,760
land in the catalonia region of spain in

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,000
this particular case

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,919
they determine uh which 12 firefighters

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,480
are going to go out there

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,679
across the borders um ensure that it's

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,120
only contained with

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,360
area they set fire with benzene

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,640
gasoline canisters and they they control

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,960
burns in the way it goes

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,720
but during this non-emergency situation

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,240
they're spending a lot of time exposed

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,159
to chemicals

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,400
carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,400
acryline the benzene from the fuel

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,679
formaldehyde all sorts of other things

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
that are burning uh

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,799
vegetation and they normally track

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,919
before during and after on paper how is

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,760
somebody feeling

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,039
um are they having headaches are they

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,480
having shorts of breath

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,280
and it's always been a paper-based

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,880
system what this solution did was

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,360
create an innovative prototype that the

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,280
firefighter wears includes sensors

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,720
and could emit data in real time to

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,720
someone in the field

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,320
in the tent uh to see the state of

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,679
everybody's exposure that they may not

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,280
even know themselves how they're you

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,440
know really immediately affecting but

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,880
affected by that chemical and what we've

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,720
done with the open source community is

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,799
take it from there

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,799
and with the team that was assembled

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,000
around the world to help them

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,320
hardware experts data scientists folks

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,080
that understand

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,679
watson health for example folks that

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,520
understand long-term averages of

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,960
exposure to chemicals

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,039
as well as folks that helped create a

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
brand new user interface for the device

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,120
other folks that helped go from the

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,960
prototype board down to the soldered

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:18,480
board which sets some on that

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,240
to the new pcb to fabricate board

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,320
uh and so we had a team for of ibm's

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,400
from around the world argentina

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,360
united arab emirates uh the united

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,559
states

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,880
um and spain themselves uh take part in

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,360
this

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,240
this initiative to bring the project to

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,200
where it is

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,760
in its current state so uh there's the

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,039
device

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,080
uh it now is offline first um it caches

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,320
information

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,400
as well as captures averages over time

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,720
which are just as important as the

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,559
real-time exposure of the firefighter

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,039
and earlier here they were able to take

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,760
the latest version of their device

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,600
and put it into a more self-enclosed

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,360
unit when it doesn't expose battery or

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,559
wires as in the first prototype that won

00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,760
the competition

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,919
uh they've deployed everything to

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,520
kubernetes uh everything is deployed and

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,840
auto deployed from github

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,039
and the documentation is being approved

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,039
in general um

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,159
uh made made more welcoming to the open

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,640
source community

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,280
um and samsung was a partner in this

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,520
they were

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,400
they lent some uh watches and ruggedized

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,159
devices

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,520
to help drive two-way communication back

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,559
to the firefighters rather than collect

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,400
the information

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,080
so really great ecosystem building

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,360
around this project

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,200
and um we're really looking for

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,679
contributors in the coming

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,720
months to help drive it forward in terms

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,760
of improving

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,600
um the hardware adding more sensors

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,200
um doing mobile development watch

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,480
development um

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,360
samsung based on java or kotlin uh web

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,360
application

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,960
plus plus i'm sorry watch based on c

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,679
plus plus or just web apps

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,960
um and data science jupiter notebooks

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,960
things like that

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,320
so uh really uh looking for community to

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,960
grow around this project

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,600
and bring it from where it is as that

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,080
robust

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,240
solution to somewhere where it can make

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,679
a greater difference not only in spain

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,679
but elsewhere around the world

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,799
so let's look at our final one and as i

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,760
mentioned these projects come in they're

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,919
still pretty

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,840
um rough around the edges and it's

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,200
usually limited to the team that created

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,799
the technology right

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,280
some of them may not be as familiar with

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,640
open source but they're really good in

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,400
you know consuming open source

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,480
technology writing code

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,840
building apps or they have some great

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
experience on the ground with the

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,960
problem domain

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,240
and what we try to do is bring them from

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,320
that raw state

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,679
through the incubation so that they can

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,039
test the technology and it can be

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,400
expanded around the world that's that's

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,640
kind of the repeating pattern

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,400
we have with all of our projects so

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,000
aggregately uh what they created for the

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
kafka challenge which was focused on

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,679
climate change last year

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,520
was an application that is able to

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,000
combine a whole bunch of data

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,760
public data from nasa as well as some of

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,600
the weather company apis around

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,120
short-term forecasting

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,840
digest that down into a way for

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,960
a small holder farmer based in mongolia

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,960
brazil or india

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,480
which is where the team is from they all

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
met at pace university in new york

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,240
though

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,320
um how a farmer can make use of this

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,640
massive amount of data

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,360
that is brought together and run through

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,760
a set of

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,559
data science algorithms written in r to

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,640
give them

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,600
immediately actionable knowledge to

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,679
start each day

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,720
about what they should plant when they

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,640
should plant it

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,640
and what sort of considerations are out

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,000
there in terms of precipitation or

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,559
temperature

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,520
so a really amazing way to use modern

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,000
technology

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,080
behind the scenes and to bring that into

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,640
a really crisp user interface

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,520
for the ubiquitous android devices that

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,559
are available

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,240
throughout emerging nations uh

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,360
they fortunately were also one of those

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,279
teams that had a local

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,919
audience to test their application with

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,279
them and uh they provided uh that

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,320
immediate feedback during the

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,240
competition

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,080
they tested with some smart the farmers

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,880
in mongolia to start

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,360
and we continued to work with them using

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,279
um

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,200
after the competition we what we do with

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,520
each team is understand their needs

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,600
based on a design thinking approach

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,919
so understanding their end users in more

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,120
detail empathizing with

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,840
what a small farmer has access to uh

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,320
what the information they need and then

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,799
working back to develop a solution

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,440
that can improve the outcomes for that

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,480
farmer

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,400
in an iterative way so that

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,400
through the agrili team startup their

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
own company uh they can build a business

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,400
model they can expand around the world

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,159
and the open source community can still

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,520
benefit from this core innovation

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,919
taking it in different directions

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,880
contributing it maybe using it in other

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,480
parts of the world where the aggro

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,679
hourly team is not focused right now

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,760
so stick out uh stick uh stay on the um

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,720
look out for uh news from this project

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,000
but uh really

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,760
really great innovation there and you

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,480
can follow their story through a bunch

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
of um

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,600
videos and updates we've had over the

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,679
years including at our recent

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,080
think conference which targets ibm

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,919
developers

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,720
now those were the top global challenge

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,120
winners but we do as i mentioned

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,400
have a set of a bunch of other open

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,600
source projects

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,760
uh that are in various states of

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,720
maturity that we uh we invite you to

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,600
look at

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,320
at a glance here um there is uh

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,400
projectile

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,000
is the cluster of protocol one we'll

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,559
have the one for promiteo under their

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,840
new name

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,760
soon and i'll mention open ew

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,679
isaac simo and liquid prep in the

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,279
following slides here but

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,480
you can also learn about these and the

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,360
call for code for racial justice

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,240
projects

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,039
through uh this the linux foundation

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,200
website

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,039
or through the github organization

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,679
directly

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,880
so uh we do have a really amazing new

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,480
project in there

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,159
in the call for code ecosystem it didn't

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,840
come as a global challenge winner but it

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,159
was amazing technology

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,799
that was being deployed in mexico and

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,440
chile by a startup called griot

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,520
and so griot did was they analyzed how

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,080
you can provide earthquake early warning

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,400
to communities that aren't uh in the

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,640
global north they're very rich folks

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,080
that can afford billion dollar national

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,159
earthquake early warning systems like

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,559
japan parts of the us

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,760
mexico and what they did was they

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,120
created a way

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,120
to um to democratize early warning

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,480
technology by creating low cost sensors

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,080
with high quality

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,760
components that can gather information

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,799
like an accelerometer in your phone

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,240
xyz data on a regular basis that can be

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,039
admitted to the cloud

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,120
and once a consensus algorithm is run

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,279
between these iot devices

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,559
uh the cloud can determine yes it's not

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,559
a false positive

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,159
uh might not a certain number of devices

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,039
confirm that there is a potential

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,200
earthquake

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,360
send the alerts so they've done some

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,760
great testing on the technology

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,480
it favors it favorably compares to some

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,279
of those national networks in mexico

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,480
but it's now open source as the open ew

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,640
project

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,159
so the community can get involved in

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,200
understanding how the hardware pieces

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,880
come together

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
as well as contributing to those

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,200
detection algorithms from the cloud

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,720
and also build applications that can

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,720
consume that data

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,559
and create new alerts in different ways

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,360
or integrate them into existing mobile

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,360
applications

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,679
so there's uh the there's a initiative

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,320
underway right now

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,200
um in puerto rico uh working with 90 of

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,799
these sensors

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,480
there was an announcement just yesterday

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,200
president clinton of the clinton global

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,279
initiative

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,320
uh talked a bit about this initiative

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,080
underway with

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,399
scientific research institutions in

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,960
puerto rico griot the startup

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,960
and the linux open source project that

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,600
powers it all behind the scenes

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,559
so uh look out for those announcements

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,840
and um

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,679
there's there's been a great community

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,200
around this project already

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,120
um within the technical steering

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,640
committee itself uh we've got

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,520
a set of independent developers we've

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,520
got seismologists ibm is there facebook

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,279
is one of the tse members

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,840
and uh it's a growing community of folks

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,399
who are improving the technology

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,679
helping develop the citizen scientists

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,520
networks behind this

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,440
as well as some of the um the national

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,880
networks that might want to take part in

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,679
this in an academic sense

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,520
or to set one up as an option for their

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,440
own earthquake early warning

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:22,399
system within their particular location

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,279
if you go to openedw.com that'll give

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,720
you

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,559
great details on the project how you can

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,240
join the slack community there

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,919
and of course on github you can take a

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,440
look at the code right now

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,120
and learn more about the censored

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,600
versions being deployed in puerto rico

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,600
as we speak

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,159
uh i'll take a look at two other

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,039
projects another one that

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,960
is in a similar domain as aggregately so

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,360
whereas aggregately focused on

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,559
getting information to farmers driving

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,039
things from the cloud

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,399
being software based liquid prep is one

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,120
that's with the linux foundation right

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,720
now

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,880
it emerged from an internal call for

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,200
code competition for ibmers

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,200
and this one has been tested uh it was

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
the 2019 internal winner

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,559
um and this one's been tested in the

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,000
field in india

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,559
as well as through some partners in

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
canada and they have an open source

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,520
community that includes the central new

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,120
mexico community college

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,200
that has developed additional types of

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,320
sensors that can be used

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,559
to inform us a farmer uh what their

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,360
current soil conditions are

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,399
what the upcoming weather uh um uh

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,600
portends

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,600
and how whether they should water today

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,120
how much they should water today based

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,320
on bringing all this information

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,720
together

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,159
um see there's uh lots of great testing

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,919
going on right now

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,679
lots of organizations involved and

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,240
always looking for for new partners to

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,720
help

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,640
improve this technology around the world

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,360
with different institutions

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,520
so this one is already a call for code

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,360
project linux foundation

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,600
and you can take a look at that tech

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,600
today

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,080
and finally here's a new project it

00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,120
comes from an organization called build

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,519
change

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,440
uh it's called isaac simo intelligent

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,640
supervision assistant for construction

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,159
and its spanish uh translation uh this

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,440
is one that actually

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,600
came in as a finalist in one of the

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,519
global competitions uh but they had such

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,440
promising technology that we continue to

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,840
want to support what they did

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,200
in the context of that challenge and

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,039
bring it into linux foundation as

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,080
something more generic as an open source

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,679
project so it is built on an earlier

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,360
project that was

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,760
created in the context of the earthquake

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,600
in nepal in 2015.

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,760
build change is a non-profit

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,039
organization that sends out experts in

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,960
emerging nations

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,240
um to assess building quality that may

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,799
not be up to curtin

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,799
certain standards um and to ensure that

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,600
after an actual disaster

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,519
it's still safe to live in and if not

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,240
what the homeowner could do to improve

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,640
it

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,519
so the initial solution behind isaac

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,159
semo

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,519
was a way to train a model on building

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,279
types in nepal

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,720
to understand based on the window

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,240
placement the door placement other

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,480
construction elements

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,880
and their current level of damage

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,480
whether they were safe to go back into

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,799
whether they were definitely not safe to

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,279
go back into and should be destroyed

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,880
or whether they should get some

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,519
remediation in terms of

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,559
retrofitting them with uh with steel

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,679
pillars or

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,399
additional concrete elements so based on

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,080
that

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,840
application that provided homeowners

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,399
with their own power to to get those

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,600
rough assessments up front the build

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,080
change team

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,200
has been working on a solution that is

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,760
dedicated more

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,039
instead of at larger buildings facades

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,600
looking at the construction elements

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,480
within

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,960
so the quality of the rebar the quality

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,360
of how

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,799
a building a brick wall has been created

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,159
in terms of the stacking of the bricks

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,039
and the mortar thickness

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,919
um and other things so really an an

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,440
amazing

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,360
data science challenge and also a

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,799
another way to use android devices that

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,039
folks have um

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,240
ubiquitous devices around the world and

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,640
so

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,320
what build change is now trying to do is

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,120
based on the context of nepal and

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,000
colombia

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,720
where they operate is create a generic

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,039
framework

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,080
for folks around the world to use this

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,039
technology as

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,799
a way to train and deploy their own

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,640
models for building quality

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,240
so in the united states we have certain

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,120
types of building conditions and

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,640
standards

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,039
uh in europe they're different in africa

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,399
and so by creating a framework where

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,080
anybody can train and

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,760
upload their models the build change

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,960
team can also validate the quality of

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,679
those models

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,559
and certify them as it were these things

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,519
can be created

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,240
as a ecosystem of trained models and

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,799
also

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,519
um folks can create their own version of

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,679
the android

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,919
application uh and deploy something for

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,159
their local uh environment

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,840
so uh keep on the lookout for this one

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,480
uh this is an amazing project we've been

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,360
working with

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,960
um with build change team for about 18

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,440
months to to bring this to the state

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,440
that it's in

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,600
so with that i hope um you're inspired

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,240
about the great technology that's there

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,480
already

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,639
but as i mentioned we are starting our

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,040
fourth year of the global competition

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,240
uh which again is going to be focused on

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,240
climate change

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,919
and if you're you're really inspired by

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,440
the solutions that have been created

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,520
i think this is a great way to learn

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,200
about those contribute to them

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,639
meet those teams in the open source

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,800
community that we have

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,399
through call for code and also build

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,839
your own skills so if you want to learn

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,040
about data science if you want to learn

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,639
about visual recognition

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,720
training machine learning models

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,119
learning about iot mesh networks

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,760
learning about sensors and data science

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,240
of

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,839
calculating averages over time there's a

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,200
lot of great tech out there

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,520
already that you can learn from and

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,720
we also want folks to take part in this

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,040
year's competition

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,079
build their own amazing stuff leveraging

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,679
potentially some of that linux

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,599
foundation technology that's there

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,359
or using additional projects like

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,159
kubernetes that are also hosted at the

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,119
lf

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,079
uh or um other technologies dedicated to

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,599
agricultural

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,520
situations for example as with the

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,119
agstack foundation which was just

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,320
announced earlier this month

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,880
so meeting the ecosystem learning the

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,839
tech

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,160
and getting involved so the theme this

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,839
year

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,560
again is climate change as it was last

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:19,839
year we have a specific focus

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,800
on the um three sub themes within

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,440
climate change

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,040
so you can build an application um for

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,280
climate change generically

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,160
or you can look at the starter kits for

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,280
three themes

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,040
that we um validated with folks at the

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,680
united nations and public and private

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,280
partners

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,040
in a design thinking workshop we did

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,720
ourselves around understanding a

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,800
potential technology

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,560
solution to clean water and sanitation

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,160
which is grounded in sustainable

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,920
development goal number two

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,079
around zero hunger which is in

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,760
sustainable development goal number six

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,359
or responsible production and green

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,640
consumption uh

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,320
sdg number 12. so uh what we try to do

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,920
through call for code is bring experts

00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,960
together so you can understand these

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,359
important issues

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,599
how they measure success in terms of

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,520
what needs to be achieved by 2030

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,200
as well as have a look at a potential

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,640
use case and solution

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,119
on how to use ibm and open source

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,640
technology to create the seed of your

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,480
submission for the competition

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,760
which you want to support as a

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,599
sustainable open source

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,119
project at the linux foundation if

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,800
you've won the competition

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,400
so i take a look at that we've got a lot

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,359
of training there's some on-demand

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,680
materials

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,640
around the competition uh things like

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,040
that

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,720
i see we do have a question about the um

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,880
the golf code application and deadline

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,320
i'll get to that in a second

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,560
but it is a multi-month global

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,320
competition and you have plenty of

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,960
resources you've got folks

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,079
that you can that you can leverage for

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,480
help in the competition

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,359
so four steps to get involved we have a

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,119
community

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:51,119
um in the ibm developer website

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,280
uh this will get you access to free

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,119
technology to build your solution

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,200
we've got lots of tutorials on the ibm

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,880
cloud which in turn is built on

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,440
a lot of linux foundation open source

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,119
technology which includes the cncf

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,960
projects and other projects from apache

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,000
and eclipse foundations as well but a

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,320
lot of great open source

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,920
there that you can consume as a service

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,920
you'll have access to 200

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,200
in credits uh with the new account for

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,160
six months

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,440
and um we've got access to um those

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,720
starter kits as i mentioned they're in

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,800
the call for code github

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,880
organization as well there's videos

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,880
there's architecture diagrams

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,920
there's lots of tutorials to get a feel

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,119
for

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,680
how you would build a solution in slack

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,440
you can find

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,119
team members you can reach out to

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,599
mentors like myself who can help you

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,960
understand open source technology and

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,119
and point you at the right experts who

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,160
might be able to guide your solution

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,599
and um the competition is open until

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,359
july 31st

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,200
so you have just under not just over two

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,440
months to build your solution

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,640
um and continue from here and um even

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,680
though we launched the competition in

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,079
march we opened

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,440
uh for participation teams like agri

00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,760
last year uh they waited at the end of

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,359
the

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,040
school the school year at pace

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,720
university which about this time

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,400
to start working on the solution so if

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,920
you haven't gotten started plenty of

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,280
time to do that

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,480
um so july 31st is the deadline

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,720
um there is a um

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,400
a project sample github repository that

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,480
you can find

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,560
that has a sample of the deliverable we

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,440
expect it's a well-documented readme

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,400
file

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,359
it's a crisp description of the problem

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,520
you're solving

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,000
includes a three-minute video and any

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,480
sort of working code you have today

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,720
that the judges can use to assess

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,280
whether the solution does what it says

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,960
and also a roadmap so as i mentioned

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,480
when call for code solutions come in

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,400
folks have only had a few months to work

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,000
on the projects we know they're

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,079
maybe not um production grade yet but

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,119
with a road map we can tell how mature

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,280
the project is

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,480
and what your grand plans are for it

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,240
going forward

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,320
uh maybe assuming you do have funding

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,880
maybe you do have contributions from

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,440
ibm experts to help you bring it forward

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,400
um so july 31st is when things are due

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,320
um but call for code is a year-round

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,240
initiative we do have a lot of ways to

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,880
get involved even beyond the competition

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,000
period

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,720
and of course in the open source

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,720
communities so please do um get involved

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,920
so with that uh let me see if there are

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,480
any other open

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,800
questions in the chat i see that we had

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,240
some answered ones

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,960
let's see okay

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,040
let me see a general chat um but if you

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,320
do have any questions please drop them

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,240
into um either the q a area or in the

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,839
chat in general

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,839
and i will get to those

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,160
we do often have we we do have a

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,480
frequently asked questions

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,520
um uh page so if you go to call for

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,839
code.org

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,599
which the website for the global

00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:59,760
competition that describes the official

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,160
rules describes the

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,400
judging criteria it has a list of judges

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,480
who are both technical and non-technical

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,000
um from organizations like we've got jim

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,200
zemlin from the linux foundation who

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,920
judges

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,480
we've got um president bill clinton

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,839
who's

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,000
involved in picking the top five

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:18,800
finalists from the semifinalists

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,079
we have technologists experts all over

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,760
the world you can you can see those

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,800
folks we have lined up for this year

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,760
on call4code.org you can also find the

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,880
faq

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,720
so it talks to what your ip is it's all

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,000
yours but the submission itself has to

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,560
be apache 2 license

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,160
so the judges can evaluate it and we do

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,119
want these to live on as open source

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,760
project

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,680
um you can learn about the team member

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,560
sizes so maximum of five

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,720
minimum of one you can compete alone uh

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,040
there's links to the starter kits

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,720
uh there's links to other potential

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,560
opportunities for you as a university

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,839
student to take part we have additional

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,079
prizes there

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,520
your university may already be involved

00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,240
so they have many acts have access to

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,079
additional

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,760
specific resources and you can also

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,000
keep keep in touch with the news and the

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,079
additional um things

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,440
okay i see we have a question in how

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,800
many hours per week

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,839
on average are required uh to work on

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,680
these projects

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,119
does it depend on the project perhaps

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,319
that's a great question

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,520
so the competition itself spans from we

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,240
launched on world water day

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,200
march 22nd this year it goes until july

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,000
31st

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,000
um of this year so that's a great window

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,319
to work on your application

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,079
and there's really no right answer as to

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,839
how much time you should spend on it

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,839
um the judging criteria one of them is

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,280
completeness transferability

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,160
but since that's balanced with

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,400
innovation usability

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,359
and uh in efficiency in what problem

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,920
you're solving

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,720
um some of it the time you spend can be

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,200
just

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,400
you're in the flow your your zone you're

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,359
doing things the last week of the

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,359
competition

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,200
you're creating amazing stuff that's

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,040
powerful there are other folks that like

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,680
to pace themselves more

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,720
deliver on two-week sprints from start

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,000
to end

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,440
um so i think on average

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,440
it can go anywhere from you know a

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,160
couple hours a week to maybe

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,960
working 40 hours a week one particular

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,359
week

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,920
and so uh it depends on the team how

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,440
your team works together the time zones

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,880
and there's really no official

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,240
level of completeness it needs you're

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,960
competing with folks from around the

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,079
world so

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,440
the more complete the better um but uh

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,119
the most important thing to leave time

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,200
for is preparing your

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,160
your kind of pitch at the end and we do

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,240
a webinar on

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,599
submission best practices but since

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,119
you're going to be

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,040
sharing your idea with technical and

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,599
non-technical judges you want to make

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,880
sure

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,040
in your submission you've got a

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,520
well-documented github repo

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,200
uh you've got a crisp three-minute video

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,200
that talks to

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,319
what you're trying to solve showing how

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,240
you're solving it

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,480
and where you want to go with it and

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,560
also leaving any additional deeper

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,160
videos or documentation in that repo for

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,079
the judges to find

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,800
um there's a there's a set of four tips

00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,839
i have so if you go to call for code.org

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,720
submit um that shows you a video with my

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,560
four tips

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,760
it shows you the submission form of

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,000
what's required

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,800
um so that you can get ahead of that um

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
folks can

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,319
you know your video quality can vary can

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,000
be super professional can be

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,440
just something you throw together on

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,319
zoom that you record yourself

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,280
talking on um but make sure you take a

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,560
look at some of the projects that have

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,160
been out there before

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,000
learn from those look at the project

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,119
sample um which is linked from that

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,560
submit page

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:39,040
and and build your solution okay

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,480
another question comes from bj chaudhary

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,520
is there any computer

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,599
language barrier um great question

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,839
you can use anything you want to build

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,599
an application for this competition

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,920
as ibm is the sponsor and founding

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,560
partner we ask that you use

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,440
one ibm cloud product or service so you

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,359
might use

00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,880
a web application runtime you might use

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,640
a serverless function you might use the

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,359
weather company apis

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,119
you might um use a blockchain platform

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,280
kubernetes code engine

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,920
anything there but you can bring in

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,720
stuff data software sets from elsewhere

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,720
open source projects so if you for

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,400
example want to embed a google maps api

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,560
something like that you can do that if

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,359
you want to pull in data from elsewhere

00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,880
if you want to

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,280
build your solution completely for

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,640
example on a local react environment on

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,040
your computer

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,920
uh just when it's ready for submission

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,520
deploy that

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,920
the ibm cloud maybe just as a web

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,079
application even if it's a static web

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,040
so that's really the only limitation and

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,119
keep in mind

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,800
that the end goal is sustainable open

00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,160
source projects so if you're building on

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,240
something that's

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,520
a really obscure language you may not

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,359
have a great audience of people to

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,240
contribute to it down the road

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,160
um and so keep that in mind or if it's a

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,520
limited access platform

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,760
we have seen some great mainframe

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,800
solutions but um not everybody has

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,560
access to a mainframe

00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,839
so think about how you're going to

00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,520
deploy your solution

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,960
if it were to be carrying on as an open

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,960
source project at the linux foundation

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,440
okay another question from ori cougar

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,040
gruber how can i attend the competition

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,400
as an observer

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,400
it would be helpful to see the

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,319
candidates in their projects

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,040
i work with over a thousand students 40

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,520
faculty as a chief

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,160
uh technician at cuny city university of

00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,520
new york great

00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,960
great to see you we've been involved

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,599
with the borough of manhattan community

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,520
college

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,520
um and actually we've had um one of the

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,960
professors from ccny

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,880
um take part as a judge in the

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,000
competition in the past

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,800
so we definitely have ways for um

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,079
as a observer to take part in the

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,960
community you can still register for the

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,000
competition join

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,280
slack introduce yourself uh we may be

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,319
interested to talk to you about being a

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,640
judge later

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,240
or we may invite you on to a webinar uh

00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,680
maybe talk about some of the key climate

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,359
change issues out there

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,520
and of course we'd love for you to share

00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,359
the message uh to students

00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,800
um so maybe you run a hackathon

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,800
specifically that targets

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,160
um your agricultural college within your

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,920
university system

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,000
things like that so yeah we definitely

00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,240
do welcome non-technical folks

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,599
as i mentioned even within the teams uh

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,520
they are helpful to create

00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,880
solutions that are well balanced and

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,839
take on a real problem

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,880
uh the one limitation we do have is um

00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,119
for prizes we can't

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,560
give them to government owned entities

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,800
so faculties

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,000
of state universities unfortunately

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,160
wouldn't be eligible as a

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,359
part of a team but they can mentor their

00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,880
students who are

00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,480
not official employees of that

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,319
university to take part

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,760
so i look at the participation agreement

00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,160
carefully if you have any questions

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,160
around that

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,400
great okay i don't see any other

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,000
questions coming in

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,079
and i know we're just about ready to

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,640
wrap up anyway so let me leave you with

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,520
some

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,839
closing um just some comments uh really

00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,839
to

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,440
to learn about call for code um check

00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,440
out ibm.com

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,560
call for code uh that's where you hear

00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,119
about this year's competition

00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,839
join slack get the invite there accept

00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,079
the

00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,280
code of conduct just like the lf has and

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,560
then if you're interested in taking a

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,119
look at the projects

00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,800
go to linuxfoundation.org if you look

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,720
through projects look for call for code

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,160
you'll see the 12 we have there as well

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,760
as links back to github

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,119
so i'm really looking forward to

00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,839
contributions that you may have this

00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,599
community

00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,440
uh feedback you may have to make the

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,359
existing apps better but also

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,119
things you might create that become the

00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,720
next big great links foundation

00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,800
innovation

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,040
so with that let me um i guess wrap it

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,880
up or hand it over to the host

00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,040
and um thank you so much

00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,200
to daniel for his time today and thank

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,000
you to all the participants who joined

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,920
us

00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
as a reminder this recording will be on

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,960
the linux foundation youtube page later

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,280
today

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:49,119
we hope you join us for future webinars

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,119
