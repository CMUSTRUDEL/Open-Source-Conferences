the way i look at it is uh because we

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,680
have unique challenges

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,920
in uh for a financial institution uh

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,440
being that we are monitored by

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,639
regulatory agencies

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,440
um we think that we've established a

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,440
fairly good

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
pattern and learned a fair bit through

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,080
our technology journey and we're hoping

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,600
that

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,279
what we've learned will be helpful to

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
you um

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,760
if you roll back a few years and my

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,279
colleague darian will go into

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,079
more detail on this but a few years ago

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,719
we began to understand that in order to

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,920
remain

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,760
competitive in order to progress

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,360
as a company we really needed to

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,320
dedicate ourselves to being a

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,680
technology company and this involved um

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
some changes

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,920
in various parts of the organization

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,800
from the technology we used

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,480
to how we use the technology itself to

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,079
how we organize ourselves

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,960
as creators and users of this technology

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,239
if you look at how we approach things

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,199
like open source

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,280
like public cloud like agile and devops

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,520
methodologies and principles

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,400
all of this was adopted at a broad scale

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,840
over the past few years and we learned a

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
great deal in this process

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
we learned what is possible we learned

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,040
about how to overcome some of the

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,920
challenges we came across

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,360
due to the aforementioned unique

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,840
challenges that we face

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,640
and we've we've come to the position

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,640
that um

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,680
this has been a great growth experience

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,520
as we go through this

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,560
uh cycle of modernization and how we um

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,680
have simultaneously delivered

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,960
great things while establishing these

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
core principles and putting them in

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,880
place

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,960
so that we have now a

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,320
culture of collaboration and a culture

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,479
of ownership

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,479
and we've nurtured that for our

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,560
engineering team so that they can

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,840
be innovative uh but at the same and

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,079
sustain that innovation

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,280
more importantly um but also so that

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,600
they can um

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,600
while while building things they can

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,680
maintain them over time

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,800
and be able to manage the risks

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,440
associated with

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,319
some of these technologies uh being a

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,640
financial institution we we look at

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,480
risk plays a very role a heavy role in

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,840
the decisions we make so we look through

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,080
all these stuff through a risk

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,160
management lens so

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
in every decision that we make we're

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,760
balancing

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,440
the progress that we'll make versus the

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,519
the risk that we have to manage and in

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,760
each case we determined that

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,519
going forward with these plans made

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,720
sense from a risk management standpoint

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,319
because

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,080
in putting them forward we're actually

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,280
helping to manage risk

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,519
whereas you know in some cases maybe

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,959
in another situation someone may make

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,640
the determination that

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,879
going forward with these technologies

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,280
could introduce new risks but

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,160
while we take into account we balance

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280
that with the

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,720
overall risk that we incur and how do we

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,360
establish the guard rails and the

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,680
process so that we can properly govern

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,280
all these new initiatives over time if

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,400
you look at the the slide here we've

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,959
laid out sort of

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,720
some of the core um principles that

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,360
we've established in this technology

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,239
journey

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,959
from modernizing our standards to

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,280
embracing an open source first mentality

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,280
to really going all in and embracing

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,400
cloud-native technologies

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,080
to rolling out agile development

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,959
methodologies

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,400
across the majority of engineering teams

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,959
i would say

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,040
really doubling down on the continuous

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,920
integration continuous delivery story

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,200
um which we can use to standardize the

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,480
technologies that are developed and how

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,879
they're developed and how they're rolled

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,200
out

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,560
and then really focusing on you know how

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,599
this affects

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,599
human beings how does our technology

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,640
affect the customers both internally at

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,519
capital one and

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,879
externally and then finally we have to

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,280
get it ready for

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,480
uh an artificial intelligence world and

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,959
making sure that we've

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,560
have ways to embed the machine learning

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,319
technologies that

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,480
we're all using to compete and then

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,480
finally balancing that against the

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,480
cyber risk so speaking of risk

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,519
management i wanted to walk through

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,000
take a step back and and look at risk

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,519
management

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,120
from a couple of different angles

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,720
because when it comes to

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,239
embracing open source technologies and

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
open source methodologies

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,440
there are some things to uh to take into

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,800
account

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,919
uh so i have here on the screen a um

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,120
a study from gartner all about software

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,759
composition analysis

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,720
and scanning and the role of scanning

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,759
but more than that

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,240
and this is something i like to talk

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,840
about a lot is viewing

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,520
the software supply chain in its

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
totality and how it

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,199
um how the provenance of the the source

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,479
code we use

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,120
uh affects how we govern its usage

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,759
inside you know uh capital one but also

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,600
governs

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,479
how we um how we think about pushing

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,160
our contributions back out upstream into

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,840
these open source communities which i'll

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,919
touch on that in a bit more detail later

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,840
but but first and foremost

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,400
how do we look at the totality of the

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,160
software ecosystem that we depend on

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,759
and how do we you know mitigate the

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,680
risks uh by

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,440
hardening that supply chain and making

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
sure that it's reliable

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
and that we can depend on it to sustain

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
our innovation going forward

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,479
um this is this plays a very large role

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,320
in how we

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,320
manage risk for our technology robots

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,759
along those same lines forester also

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,520
came out with a report

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,039
focusing on cloud container adoption in

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,080
the enterprise but

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,320
you could really look at the

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,280
the takeaways from this report and apply

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,600
it to

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,479
frankly any new technology that's being

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
adopted

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,960
on a massive scale across the industry

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,960
in this case cloud computing i'm sorry

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,720
container adoption but it could apply to

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,199
uh to anything really

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,720
but the the finding here is that

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,160
compliance is the number one concern

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,759
among senior tech leaders using

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,240
container management platforms

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,600
you could insert a lot of different

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
technologies in that place maybe

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
kubernetes well container management or

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,759
some other

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,560
technology platform but the key here is

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
when managing risk it's all about how do

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,360
we

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,440
adopt the technologies that are going to

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,400
sustain our productivity

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,560
while making sure that we comply with

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,680
the various regulatory bodies that

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,600
monitor us um and also making sure that

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,120
you know we manage the the licensing the

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,199
open source licensing in a

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,800
uh in a way that makes sense for our

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,319
developers and users

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,759
and how do we make sure that you know

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,560
the guard rails that we've established

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,440
can be

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,280
uh monitored without getting in the way

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,039
of our developers how do we

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,039
create a system that allows our

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,520
developers to do their jobs

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:51,599
without us interfering

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,960
and further to that point if you look at

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,720
the real impact

00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,319
of say open source of devops and agile

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,039
and cloud first principles you can see a

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,680
very real

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,120
impact across the enterprise this is a

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,560
2019 survey from the

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,520
linux foundation the the wonderful host

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
of today's

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,000
session but in this in the survey that

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,199
was released in september

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,599
of 2019 you can see that

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,720
the organizations that adopt open source

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,199
methodologies and

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
an open source approach they're the ones

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,199
that deploy the most often

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,479
they're the ones that you know use the

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,160
most open source code

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,960
there is a tangible relationship there

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,599
that i think

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,319
speaks to the flexibility that's allowed

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:45,039
by

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:47,039
mass adoption of open source software

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,360
and then we come to you know i spoke a

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,599
couple minutes ago about how we

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,960
view software usage and governance

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,160
through a

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,520
risk management lens and to help us

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,560
with that view i often like to refer to

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,360
the supply chain funnel which helps us

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,680
ascertain where a particular product is

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,280
in its development life cycle

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:15,440
but it also when looking at this funnel

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,840
it also implies an ease with which

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,879
it can be bi-directional so that no

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,440
matter where you are

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,160
in the funnel you're always taking in

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,039
feedback

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,440
and contributing back to the source of

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,800
the the software that you use

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,639
when you when you look at the supply

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,680
chain funnel think of most of the

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,000
upstream

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,719
open source technologies that we that we

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,279
use

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
in in building our software uh think of

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,719
those in the top layer

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,320
those are the the core development

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,360
libraries the core platforms that we

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
develop on

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
uh think of all the the javascript

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,480
node.js pieces that you know

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,800
most enterprises use on a daily basis

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
um all of that is consists of

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,200
essentially raw parts

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,320
and as we move down the funnel these raw

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,959
parts coalesce

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
until at the very end we have a released

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,240
product

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,839
and by looking at it at the at the

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,120
software development process

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,640
through this diagram we're able to

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,519
first of all make sure that we've got

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,959
the processes in place by which we can

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,279
sustain the development of these

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,080
upstream communities but also see

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,519
how it links to our overall product

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,920
development so that

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,200
we're linking our open source usage and

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,080
methodologies

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,760
directly to the value chain so that

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,360
there's a clear link we can demonstrate

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,600
a clear link between

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,240
our adoption of open source uh and the

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,320
increase of value of what we deliver

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,920
um one thing i really like to point out

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
every time i talk about the supply chain

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,600
funnel is that

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,600
this mid tier it has interesting

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,080
properties in its own right

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,080
because this is the stage where the raw

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
parts that you initially bring in

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,320
you know they first start to coalesce

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,959
around a relatively mature platform

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
not a polished product per se but a

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,480
relatively stable and mature

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
platform that attracts developers this

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,680
is where you

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,200
build out your developer ecosystems as

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,320
well as maybe get your

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,839
first early adopters uh and i i love

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,800
that the unique properties of this layer

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,120
and i can

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,959
i can talk uh separately just about that

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
middle layer uh if anybody wants to hear

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,240
me

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,480
in another session but but overall you

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,640
know

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,560
capital one just like a lot of different

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,200
larger enterprises

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,800
perhaps 80 to 90 percent of the software

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,079
that we develop

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,279
comes from open source sources and so

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,160
by looking at it in this way it helps us

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,600
to

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,399
understand the prominence of the

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,200
software we use so that we make sure to

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,680
think about the sustainable development

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
of

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,040
each parts of this funnel making sure

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,279
that the top tier

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,040
the top of the funnel is sustainable is

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,760
every bit as important as making sure

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,839
that the

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,440
the bottom tier the release product is

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,839
also sustainably developed

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,839
so this is um this is key to our

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
thinking

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,320
so as part of um undertaking this

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,560
journey of modernization

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,240
of our technology both and and

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,959
modernization technology takes the form

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,680
of both

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,120
the technology platforms that we use as

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,839
well as the way we put together

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,200
technology

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,360
and the way we put together

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,279
organizations to to ensure this culture

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,839
of collaboration

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,399
the open source program office was

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,680
started

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,240
some five years ago to help ensure

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,920
that that we have the processes and

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,200
people in place to to make sure that

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,480
we're doing the right thing

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,160
and so this comprises five different

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,959
um channels or uh or columns

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,800
so beginning with usage how we use the

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,240
software we take in

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,160
and going back to the supply chain

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
funnel would be like uh

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,920
the pieces of software that that fill

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,320
out that top layer

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,760
how do we bring that in how do we ingest

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,880
it and push it into

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,200
our development

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,160
processes how do we make sure that we're

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,440
using the best

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,560
versions how do we make sure that

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,160
we've identified and remediated you know

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
significant vulnerabilities

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
how do we make sure that the license

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,320
management is um according to you know

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,720
is

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,399
in compliance um all these things we we

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,839
look at when we're

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,480
bringing in new software for our

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,399
developers and the second piece of that

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,839
is the contribution and this is where i

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
talk about this is where i

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,240
um in the previous diagram i alluded to

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,880
the bi-directional nature of the

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,320
of the funnel and in this case it's we

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,079
help to mitigate risk

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,079
by making sure that the contribution

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,000
process is streamlined

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,839
such that developers can take the

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,560
changes they make

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,240
and push them back upstream because we

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,839
don't want to be maintaining technical

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,760
debt over time

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,200
and this having a streamlined

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,760
contribution process

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,959
helps us to to manage our technical debt

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,040
more sustainably

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,360
so it doesn't uh increase dramatically

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,920
over time we can kind of keep it at

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
a base level and then finally

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,360
sponsorship

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,480
sponsorship is a word we use to describe

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,360
when we release

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,440
open source software projects how do we

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,760
launch open source communities

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,200
again this is key because for the

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,680
software we develop

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,639
and when you think about it from a uh

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,839
a technical debt perspective and how you

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,920
manage that

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,120
and when you think about it from a um

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,760
making sure that

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,639
the software is robust and delivers

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,920
according to

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,959
you know what we'd like the visibility

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,800
that it attains by being available in

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,240
open source communities

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,920
is is highly valuable because now

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,880
we have many third parties who will

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,639
determine

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,079
you know how well it works and if it

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,199
doesn't work as well for them they will

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,440
they will let us know

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,959
and we can build that into the process

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,560
and make sure that not only are we

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,800
managing risk from a technical debt

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,160
standpoint but we're managing risk

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,560
from a robustness of software standpoint

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
and the the last two things uh this

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,720
fourth piece

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,399
inner source this is all about the

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,880
culture of collaboration and ownership

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,279
that

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,120
we've worked so hard to build here how

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,199
do we make sure that

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,959
our developers are coalescing around

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,760
those middle tiers in the supply chain

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,199
funnel

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,120
how do we make sure that the platforms

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,480
we built are becoming

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,880
viable standards that support

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,480
the initiatives of developers and users

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,560
at capital one

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,320
and then the fifth one is this goes back

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,880
to the sustainability

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,320
of the communities that we depend on how

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,199
do we make sure

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,160
that um the software we depends on will

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
continue to be

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,440
reliable over time and and can sustain

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,040
our innovation

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,720
internally and so this is where we

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,560
invest in

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,399
communities and foundations like the

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,760
linux foundation like the continuous

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,519
delivery foundation

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,480
like finos the cncf the apache software

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,440
foundation

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,920
it's all about making sure that we can

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,320
continue this symbiotic relationship

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,639
and rely on uh on these core pieces over

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,639
time

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,399
all right and now i'm going to turn over

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,680
to my colleague darian

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,720
darien take it away thanks john mark

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,959
as as john mark mentioned earlier uh

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,040
there's a there's a whole area you know

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,079
there's multiple spaces that we had to

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,680
go through

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,800
and and changes to our culture to enable

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,560
not just you know leveraging open source

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,199
but but modernizing our whole

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,480
technology mindset and so i'm going to

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,880
take you a little bit through

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,759
the history of that how we got to where

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,279
we are

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,800
some of the pitfalls that we accounted

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,800
for some of the things that we learned

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,600
along the way

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,600
and if you take go back to where the

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,320
beginning where we decided

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,880
we we need to be a tech company we need

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,519
to be

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,399
we need to play in this space because uh

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,160
that is what

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,839
is being you know that's where all the

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,399
competitive uh

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,240
realities are right for us to really

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,279
survive and lead

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,800
uh in the financial space we recognized

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,959
we had to change the way that we did

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,839
business and it had to start at the base

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,360
here

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,040
and a lot of that came from our

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,519
acquisition of ing direct

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,120
that sort of kicked off the hey look you

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,800
know technology first

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,839
seems to make a real sense there

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,959
so as john mark said going in all in on

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,959
agile was was

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,639
one of the the first pieces there uh and

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,079
building all the way through getting

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,199
open source saying

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,279
that we're going to start dabbling in

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,000
the cloud you know going through

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,120
containers

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,720
committing to the cloud you know

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,480
building a container platform for the

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,240
enterprise you know that's led us to

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,560
where we are today which is

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,000
100 in the public cloud we have shut

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,199
down our data centers

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,880
uh we have no more legacy uh legal

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,639
legacy system operations or anything

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,279
like that

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,720
and to understand the scope of that we

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,520
have a technology organization that's

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,959
about 10 000 strong

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,240
and having that change from waterfall to

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,120
agile

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,919
educating that that large group of of

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,120
engineers and folks

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,319
comes at a cost it is hard to do and

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,760
those journeys

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,079
are are the ones that are going to be

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,480
the most challenging for organizations

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,360
open source actually makes some of that

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,240
easier

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,960
because there's so much available out

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,240
there

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,120
that we can leverage and bring to the to

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,000
the table

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,799
to enable our technologies to really

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,080
help us do our business

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,080
uh next slide please

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,160
so as we started dabbling in the cloud

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,160
you know we have to recognize we're a

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,200
highly regulated company

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,960
right we are a financial company people

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,320
people trust us with their their

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,760
financial health

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,400
with their money and we are 100

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,880
committed to ensuring that that we do

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,360
the

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
the right thing for them and and keeping

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,440
that trust

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,160
we also had to make sure that we enabled

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,880
the the engineers working in the cloud

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,400
to understand the cloud to how do they

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,480
start operating the cloud

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,480
in an effective way so that they could

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,160
get the job done

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,559
while making sure that we were we were

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,200
compliant making sure that we were safe

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,960
in doing those things you know some of

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,080
the things we had to do is stand up

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,520
uh we built a very comprehensive tech

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,640
college to to help educate we have

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,440
very large numbers i think you know if

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,559
this is

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,679
we're pretty close to the the uh

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,520
the having the highest percentage of aws

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,039
certified associates

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,760
next to amazon itself uh because we

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,840
believe in

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,679
that education piece and making sure

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,000
that the organization

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,799
has the knowledge necessary to do these

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,679
things

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,320
but we didn't get there overnight right

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,039
having this

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,840
this constant education and constant

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,880
learning

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,120
it was absolutely necessary and

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,320
when we started moving into the cloud

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
obviously we can't just do everything

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,440
all at once

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,200
it's a let's let's take some of these

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,600
easier pieces some of the leaves of the

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,200
of the tree there things that were less

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,799
dependent upon other pieces

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,039
that we could move over and do a lift

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,000
and shift to start out with

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,000
next slide please

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,480
so some of the

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,880
the mentality that we clearly had to

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,400
adopt pretty early was

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,559
has to be automated we have to have

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,760
devops we have to enable these teams to

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,520
operate on their own

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,880
so we've had this you build it you own

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,520
it mentality

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,000
but along with that of course comes some

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,640
of its

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,480
own issues of duplicating problems

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,360
duplicating solutions

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,880
we've got 8 500 engineers you know over

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,159
a thousand teams

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,760
invariably team over here doesn't know

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,600
what team over there is doing and they

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,559
need to solve the same thing

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
open source was 100 leveraged in almost

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,919
all of these

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,880
but sometimes even leveraging those open

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,320
source pieces

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,159
you can put them together in different

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,640
ways that duplicate

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,039
a solution but in different ways so

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,799
there's a lot of um

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,320
undifferentiated heavy lifting that

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,400
occurs

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,280
when we want to try and minimize that as

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,280
much as possible

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:38,640
so next slide please

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,039
part of the pieces that enabled us to

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,159
start being a little bit less

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,120
duplicative in

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,559
our efforts were some of these pieces of

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,360
software that we recognized we had to

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,640
have

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,120
one was hijia which gave us the ability

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,600
to

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,039
view that devops pipeline that ci cd

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,600
pipeline

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,159
very well from from you know start to

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,280
finish

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,320
and understand where everyone was and

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,600
in 2015 uh we were able to make that

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,360
open source

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,840
and immediately started getting great

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,799
contributions from a huge part of the

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,760
the community out there uh as it stands

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,520
right now walmart

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,960
i believe has you know over five

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,840
thousand active

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,000
uh hygiena users and they use it widely

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,400
in their organization

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,240
cloud custodian cloud custodian is a is

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,200
a automated governance and security and

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,039
appliance

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,200
uh as well as some cost optimizations

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,159
cloud environments and we've had great

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,760
engagement across the industry amazon

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,159
microsoft

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,919
and we've recently donated it to the

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,120
cncf

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,360
and this is 100 behind our

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,559
our mission that john mark you know

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,200
leads here

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,559
we need to give back we want to to

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
generate

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,679
great software and we want those

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,320
contributions back

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,960
from the community because we know that

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,799
there's

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,960
brilliant people out there that have

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,200
great perspective that we can also learn

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,200
from

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,240
next slide please

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,760
so as we're going through this journey

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,600
here towards you know

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,960
more recently let's say within the past

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,120
couple years

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,799
as we moved most of our workloads into

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,919
the cloud

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,720
using more fundamental uh

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,240
portions of it we realized hey there's a

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,080
lot of opportunity here maybe to

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,600
consolidate workloads

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,200
to get a little bit more smaller

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,600
bite-sized pieces

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,120
and so we recognized we really had to

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,880
have a container platform for the

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,559
enterprise that met our needs

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,120
from a security standpoint from a

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:43,200
regulation standpoint

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,320
and we've been we've been building that

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,240
for us forrester recently you know found

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,880
86 percent of technology leaders plan to

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,000
use containers for more applications

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,080
that is clear clearly aligns with us we

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,440
recognize that it is it is the path

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,360
forward for us

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,080
um we based ours on kubernetes and

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,080
because we are again a regulated entity

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,400
we have a lot of unique needs and

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,760
challenges that we have to solve for

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,280
some of those pieces some of those

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,000
fundamental pieces of our container

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,039
platform

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,840
we have open sourced crit is one of them

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,120
e2d is another those are available on

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,640
our open source repos

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,200
on github right now and as we look

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,440
forward

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
as we move forward and build up more i'm

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,400
sure more pieces of that will

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,840
will come out because we want to

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,799
leverage the investment that the

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,640
community can provide

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,520
next slide so

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,400
you know in closing there's so much

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,760
opportunity

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,559
with open source software for an

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,200
enterprise even a highly regulated one

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,679
uh

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,360
we from our own experience our journey

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,080
of moving into the cloud and becoming

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,159
this tech

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,760
first company uh could not have been

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,320
made possible without

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,320
open source

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,559
yeah that's a that's a very good point

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,799
uh

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,240
it's it's interesting to look back over

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,679
the history and

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,840
and see how much of the current

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,600
state of technology as we know today how

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,919
much that would not be possible

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,200
if not for the initial development of

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,400
open source platforms

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,880
that's been crucial as well as the

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,080
the the cloud platforms i've developed

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,760
concurrently

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,679
um the other thing i want to point out

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,320
is that when we talk about

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,159
risk mitigating risk and risk management

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,320
and the software supply chain

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:39,520
um it's crucial it's a vital important

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,679
of vital importance that you learn how

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,760
to build the relationships with your

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,039
risk partners and it is something i i

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,039
like to emphasize

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,520
a lot which is you know there's a

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,440
tendency among developers to

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,440
uh to i guess misunderstand the intent

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,320
of the auditors and the the risk

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,360
managers and

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,039
those folks and i and and legal staff

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,000
and i just want to um mention that

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,640
those are vital partnerships that should

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,720
be built

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,640
in order to if you want to build and

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,919
sustain and make this manageable over

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,080
time

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,440
it's it's crucial to to bring those

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,120
people along

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,720
and make sure that they are your core

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,679
partners when you move forward with any

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,000
of this stuff

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,600
um that's one of the that's one of the

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,480
takeaways i've had from uh

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,400
working with uh in capital one as well

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,799
as a variety of other companies

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,159
they can help you unlock so much as you

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,360
move forward and

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,360
we couldn't do what we do without their

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,039
support and input and helping to move

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,559
this forward so when you look at things

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,200
through a risk management lens

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,799
um you know run that by your risk

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,840
partners and and make sure that you've

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,200
established

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
done the work to establish those

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,840
relationships

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,559
that's a great point uh and i think

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,279
um that's the the end of our core

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,000
content

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,120
uh i think uh right now we can open it

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,559
up to questions

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,600
i think there are some yes i i

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,080
i will uh i've got questions yeah i'll

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,200
be the

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,679
presenter of questions cool so first one

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,799
for you

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,640
john mark is uh how has capital one

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,440
tackled legal and governance concerns

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,840
around open source contributions

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,799
excellent question um the first part of

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,480
that is

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,840
i'll answer that with by taking on the

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,159
the first the first

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,000
unspoken part which was there was a long

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,720
process to make sure that we were

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
governing open source usage first uh

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,240
first and foremost

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,919
um we had to make sure we had the

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,320
processes and the infrastructure in

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,559
place to support what we wanted to do

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,320
with open source from a usage standpoint

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,400
when it came to contributing

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,080
uh you know one of the things that

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,679
attracted me to capital one

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,440
was you know i've been in open source

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,360
communities for many years

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,799
and i saw that uh you know it takes some

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,919
work to get large enterprises to

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,240
to be engaged and to be contributing to

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,919
um

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,159
communities and that's what attracted me

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,360
to california to to

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:12,640
help uh streamline that process

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,080
um and one of the things that you know i

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,120
found out is that

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,559
uh there's is

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,640
speaking of the the unique challenges

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,360
that we face in regular industry

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,080
we it was basically a question of how do

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,480
we

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,159
frame the issue if you frame the issue

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,840
as yeah we want to

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,919
stick some things open source it's

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,000
because it's fun to do

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,360
it really has to be about what value

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,799
does it deliver

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,600
and once you frame it as hey there we

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,399
need to balance

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,440
risks by making sure that we're we're

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,200
managing our risk

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:50,880
of uh technical debt management we're

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:54,080
managing our risks of um you know

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,120
not being visible externally um

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,520
these are all the things that we have to

00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,080
balance when we're conceiving of our

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,960
contribution processes so we made some

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,080
initial

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,120
headway on this a few years ago and then

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,640
over time

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,039
we've been able to refine that and

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,679
streamline the process and in fact

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,120
we're in the process right now of

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,600
further streamlining it

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,360
uh and making it more accessible and

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,399
easy to use for our developers as part

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,760
of our ongoing

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,480
you know building of the culture of

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,240
collaboration that's great

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,760
uh just as a reminder to anyone

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,440
listening if you do have a question

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,399
please just click the little qa button

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,360
you can you can put it right in there

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,679
the next one i'm going to take uh what

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,679
makes a container platform compliant

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,919
what regulations does capital one care

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,880
about

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,200
uh so that's a a very good question and

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,919
i

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,960
i think you know when it comes to your

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,399
companies

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,240
it's going to be a variable

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,159
from a capital one perspective the

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,480
things we care about are

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,960
do we have some sort of chain of custody

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,960
of those containers can we guarantee

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,279
what is being deployed into production

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,159
is exactly what was you know committed

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,760
in code

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,360
so we have that that um that that uh

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,200
viability and the ability to verify

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,679
what that actually is are the things

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,440
running in the container platform all

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,840
from the appropriate place

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,799
have they all been vetted appropriately

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,320
do they have

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,159
you know the appropriate permission

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,120
lockdowns do we have them tagged

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,279
appropriately

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,039
so that the right teams get called when

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,799
those containers are not running

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,159
running well the the composition of the

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,159
containers themselves

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,080
are they as minimal as possible do we

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,399
have as little vectors of attack

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,679
as possible in there are they patched

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,480
are they rehydrated

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,080
how long are they keep are they running

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,520
do we want a container that sits there

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,880
and runs for 60 days

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,480
and and never never dies probably not

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,919
we'd rather probably have something that

00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,080
runs for maybe a maximum of 24 hours

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,039
right and leverage the capabilities of

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,600
containers

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,799
to automatically spin up and spin down

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,200
and balance across

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,080
live containers so that even if someone

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,240
were to

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,919
compromise a given container they would

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,320
only have a short period of time to do

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,559
any work inside of that container

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,159
so so a lot of those things that we

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,919
think about

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,000
they're not necessarily baked into any

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,000
platform right there's no one tool out

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,320
there that does all of this for you

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,840
a lot of it is open source software that

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,240
we've we've had to leverage

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,679
and software that we've built to help us

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,600
achieve these pieces

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,720
so that the developers don't have to

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,399
think about these things

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,159
right they just know they they deploy a

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,000
container and it's going to be compliant

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,399
by using this base container

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,360
and they use you know these these tools

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,880
inside of production

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,279
will automatically handle some things

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,279
for them

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,880
next question for you john mark is

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,159
how do you harden the open source supply

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,760
chain is this

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,760
sdlc simplification

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,679
how do you harden the open source supply

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,559
chain how do you how do you simplify

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,559
sdlc

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,320
all right yeah you know but maybe i'll

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,440
take a pass on that one but um

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,080
but hardening the open source supply

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,519
chain i can address that uh

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,360
the open source you harden the open

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,240
source supply chain by being involved

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,120
and being present

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,080
um and this comes back to you know how

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,279
we view uh

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,799
risk um i've seen so many companies

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:27,039
uh that view risk from the standpoint of

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,000
we're gonna take an open source code and

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,679
we're going to

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,120
scan it for vulnerabilities and then

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,320
we're gonna remediate that with those

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,760
and we're going to use our software and

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,399
we're done

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,760
um that doesn't harden the supply chain

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,799
that is basically

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,440
uh foregoing uh the supply chain

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,640
maintenance

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,519
to somebody else whereas if you are

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,120
involved

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,640
in the supply chain process and

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,799
developing it um

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,679
you're going to ensure that it's more

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,159
robust

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,760
more sustainable over time um and by

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,279
being present and involved

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,679
uh you're helping the communities on

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,880
which you depend uh be more reliable and

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,200
sustainable over time

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,720
i feel that this yields the best results

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,200
um over time

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,159
because what better way to manage

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,559
vulnerabilities

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,080
and protect cyber security than to

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,080
prevent vulnerabilities from ever

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,559
appearing in the first place

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,840
this is this is uh uh you know

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,519
especially why

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,919
contributing and being present in these

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,360
communities is so important

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:29,279
yeah that makes a lot of sense

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:32,159
uh okay next question i'm going to

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,440
um i'm going to answer this first one

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,159
and it's it's going to be a quickie and

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,279
then i'll just

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,720
answer a follow-up to the containers um

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,880
so the first question is how long does

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,000
it take for a company to become 100

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,039
in the cloud well i can share with you

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,159
my experience with capital one i joined

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,320
uh almost four years ago to the day

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,200
uh and when i joined we were about eight

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,559
percent

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,679
of our workloads in the cloud

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,720
and we were 100 in the cloud earlier

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,600
this year

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,360
so for us it was a three and a half ish

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,760
year journey

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,919
that i think is going to be very

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,080
dependent upon

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,679
your individual organization the

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,080
commitment you have to that

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,840
the buy-in from the very top because

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,360
it's not an easy process

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,519
it is extremely complex to do and

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,200
there's only really one other major

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,120
company that we're aware of that's done

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,440
it and that that was netflix

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,720
so um there's probably others out there

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,799
but nothing

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,960
probably anywhere close to our size in

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,679
revenue or anything like that

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,399
yeah um does that drive with you john

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,679
mark

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:46,000
oh yeah yeah absolutely and then the

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,760
uh the other piece is uh let's see

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,679
oh okay the question has changed a

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,640
little bit so do you still use you build

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,440
it you own it

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,159
the answer is yes and we've just shifted

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,880
that a little bit

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,519
right so now the platform itself has

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,159
responsibilities for certain things

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,600
but as a developer as a development team

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,640
you're still responsible for the

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,880
construction

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,879
uh of your you know container or your

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,359
your lambda or whatever it is

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,159
as well as being responsible for

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,760
operating it

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,200
and making sure that the metrics are set

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,000
up correctly the scaling is set up

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,560
correctly

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,760
the on-call rotation is all there so

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,159
yeah it's it's core our teams

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,839
uh embrace that uh it's it's a it's a

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,839
core part of who we are

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,159
absolutely all right question for you

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,399
john mark what is your strategy for

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,760
joining or contributing to open source

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,480
foundations

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,119
that is a terrific question because it

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,720
changes

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,599
over time and it really depends on

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,359
linking the software used to the value

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,280
that's delivered

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,599
taking a look at what software do you

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,320
depend on what communities do you depend

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,720
on

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,560
how is it used internally and then we

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,960
use that to determine

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,839
you know which which foundations does it

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,320
make the most sense to support

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:07,200
financially a lot of this comes down to

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,240
which foundations which communities are

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,200
our

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,119
developers already involved in so we

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,200
take input from a variety of sources

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,880
from our developers but ultimately it

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,119
comes down to

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,400
how do we again view through reviewing

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,880
the risk management lens

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,680
how do we ensure that we are best able

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,000
to

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,599
sustain our innovation internally and

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,760
using that to determine

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,960
and basically ranking which foundations

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,560
are the most important to us and which

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,640
ones do we participate in

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,000
so that's uh that's definitely the

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,480
approach we take but it again

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,520
it shifts technology changes over time

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,440
new foundations

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:46,240
pop up over time um you know we have

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,400
several different teams that uh will

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,960
will take on new technologies uh that we

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
have to

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,720
be kept up to date with so it's it's uh

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,680
it it it evolves um but we're always

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,320
looking to see

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,160
you know where should we be um putting

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,800
placing our bets

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,960
yeah i i can only imagine and i'm

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,160
nowhere near as plugged in as you are

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,880
to the whole ecosystem i mean there are

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,320
probably what

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,000
dozens of different foundations out

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,320
there that you have to keep a pulse

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,839
on yeah you can't throw a rock without

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,200
hitting three different foundations

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,040
so it's yes it's uh

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,640
there are a number of there are there's

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,640
no shortage of communities to

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,560
invest your time and money and that's

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,800
why you have to be uh

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,240
that's why you have to link it back to

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,400
the value that you deliver

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,839
and make sure that you know it makes

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,240
sense when you're

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,920
putting your resources into uh various

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,800
communities and foundations

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,680
ultimately you know you're you're you're

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,240
going to need

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,960
to to be able to to back up your claim

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,880
that um

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,480
investing in these is important and what

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,520
better way to do that than to show

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,440
you know the usage patterns internally

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,280
and and what you know which ones are the

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,480
most important to you

00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,320
yeah all right next question i i think

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,760
this is one that maybe we can both

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,760
tag team on um

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,800
understanding that company-specific

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,599
software creation will not be open

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,440
sourced

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,040
and that technology-based capabilities

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,880
can be open sourced

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,400
where does capital one draw the line on

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,200
open sourcing

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,320
when it is industry-specific i.e

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,560
regulation-based

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,720
capabilities that's

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,640
that's an interesting question you know

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,280
it's i would say it's early days yet

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,560
but um i would say if there uh there

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,640
could be an opportunity

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,000
to partner up speaking of our open

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,040
source foundations

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,320
um we are involved in the phenos

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,880
foundation which is comprised mostly of

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,760
financial institutions and i know that's

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,560
certainly an area

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,359
that they care about and i look forward

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,640
to

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,400
continuing that conversation i think

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,000
it's going to be more important every

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,440
time

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,640
i that yeah that jives with me and and

00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,960
you know i think maybe a little bit more

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,640
when i think about it you know we we

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,200
open source cloud custodian right and

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,400
that is

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,000
the way we ensure compliance and yet

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,480
we're not necessarily giving away the

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,839
secret sauce as to what those policies

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,960
specifically are

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,680
on how we we we secure things

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,400
mostly because our environment is going

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,560
to be different

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,520
than all of yours out there right we we

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,240
have

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,839
you know hundreds of different aws

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,400
accounts and and gcp

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,440
and azure and things like that and how

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,160
we've structured them

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,440
has evolved over time and it may not be

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,839
the same as yours so

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,280
those policies may not be appropriate

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,240
for your environment

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,599
and i would i would think that you know

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,640
we never want to give away the secret

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,680
sauce which is

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,720
our our secret sauce is banking right

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,400
it's financial uh so those pieces of

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,119
software we will probably never open

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,040
source

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,160
but the all the things around it on how

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,440
we operate

00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,240
um there's probably a quite a bit more

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,200
that is available than than we have yet

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,320
to open source

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,560
thank you for bringing that back to

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,079
cloudcastor because yes

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,160
the core technology pieces the core

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,240
platforms we feel that they're uh

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,280
general enough and we feel that we face

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,440
the same problems

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,720
as several other enterprises that those

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,599
are the ones that are um

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,320
most viable uh and and to um darien's

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,359
point

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,160
you know chances are the um the specific

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,720
policies that

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,760
the content that we use on top of these

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,800
platforms is

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,000
frankly not um useful to the vast

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,079
majority of people but the

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,359
the core platforms and getting those in

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,320
a place where they are

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,440
more robust and and ready um to serve uh

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,359
general purposes

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,599
you know that's that's where uh it makes

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,640
sense to invest most of our time

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,920
yeah that makes sense um i've got one

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,560
more for you john market and i think

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,320
we're going to wrap

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,400
what is the biggest challenge as capital

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,760
one sees it around enterprise developers

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,760
contributing to open source communities

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,760
the biggest challenge um

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,160
that's uh that that that question could

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,000
be um addressed over

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,200
uh days weeks months um

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,920
you know it's sorry but no it's it's

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,760
it's a

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,520
i mean that's that that's that's part of

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,960
the i mean that's a that's an evolving

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,359
answer too um just because uh this most

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,160
significant challenges change over time

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:26,400
um you know initially maybe if you

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,000
scroll back a few years ago

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,839
uh the biggest challenge was making sure

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,240
that you know we had

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,400
that we knew uh who was contributing

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,240
what and that we could um

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,520
and that we could manage that a little

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,119
better um

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,720
and that was really that was really down

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,720
to you know how to

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,400
how do engineers know the best way to

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,920
contribute software

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,000
at this point i would say that the the

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,319
biggest challenge is

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,480
how how do we facilitate the

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,960
relationships between our developers

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,000
and the upstream communities to which

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,640
they contribute

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,440
so that we can pave the way for more

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,520
streamlined processes

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,359
every community has its own standard for

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,960
contribution

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,880
and engineers have to spend a lot of

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,440
time coming up to speed and what each of

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,000
those are

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,760
and so i feel that part of our job as an

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
open source program office

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,839
is to help them you know learn those

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,319
skills and learn how to

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,119
pivot between communities as needed

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,720
that's probably

00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,640
the biggest challenge it's really not

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,680
technical in nature it's really um

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,680
community based i i i would

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,359
100 agree with you and and i was

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,480
thinking in my head

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,960
you know when it comes down to it

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,480
fundamentally from my experience and

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,880
seeing my teams it's

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,000
it's time right it's it's what time do

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,920
they have

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,440
right where they can contribute and they

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,839
can they can take the time

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,960
to go through and and and engage with

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,280
those communities

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,560
you know do the prs making sure that you

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,440
know the code we

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,119
we you know commit is go through the

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,680
appropriate process make sure we're not

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,599
you know

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,119
exfoliating any data and all this type

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,599
of stuff and yeah

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,359
the fact of the matter is you don't need

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,839
a majority of your engineers

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,800
contributing upstream to communities all

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,480
the time

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,640
to make it sustainable you really only

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,839
need uh some

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:17,200
group uh core group that that does

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:19,680
that does this on a regular basis um

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,280
frankly and to your point it all comes

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,800
down to time and time management making

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,680
sure that people are focusing where they

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,200
need to be

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,359
uh and that's probably the biggest

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,160
challenge just making sure that

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,880
you've got a clear you know uh guideline

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,640
for

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,240
for who's contributing and when uh and

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,040
how so yeah

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,040
i think that's great

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:44,480
cool all right

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,560
all right well thank you so much darian

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,160
and john mark we really appreciate

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,440
today's presentation

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,560
and your thoroughness with the questions

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,640
um i'd like to wrap us up and just thank

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,119
everybody for joining us and

00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,760
have a wonderful rest of your day

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,240
awesome

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,240
thanks everyone thank you it's fun
