Description: 
	Sponsored by IBM

Continually renewing technology skills are critical to developers, and to their ever more digital and competitive businesses. In fact, a majority of developers consider skills and knowledge related to underlying Open Source cloud technologies to be more beneficial to their careers, than skills related to any specific cloud. This is one of many research findings revealed in a Fall 2020 collaboration with Oâ€™Reilly Media, where over 3500 professional developers and managers responded.

thanks christina and welcome everyone

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,359
thanks for joining in

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,720
um so i've titled uh my talk today a

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,679
little bit differently than what it was

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,080
on the uh

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,120
on the site when i did the abstract you

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,000
know after a while we

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
we uh we got around to thinking the the

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,480
response to the report seems to be very

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,000
much so that it's the skills aspect

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,160
and having having that being good for

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,119
your career and something that

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,680
that hiring managers are looking for um

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,000
and so

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,599
i decided to tweak the the title a

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,040
little bit so i've called it building

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,600
open source skills is good for your

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,079
career

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,840
and this is the way if you're a fan of

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,840
the mandalorian you'll understand that

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,239
there we go so again i'm chris harris

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,120
i'm an ibm fellow

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,200
and cto for open technology um basically

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,079
i have overall responsibility for all of

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,079
the

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,600
open source and open standards work that

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,800
we do at ibm

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,280
um and uh i i have a team

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,719
that's you know very much engaged in

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,520
open source and

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,040
uh i myself am and frequently engaged in

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,240
this project or that um

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,799
most recently i was uh deeply involved

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,360
in

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,640
creating the probably the hyperledger

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,280
organization

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,000
and uh served as a maintainer board

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,040
member

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,560
chair of tsc and so forth and uh and

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,799
this past year

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,600
worked very closely with uh some

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,799
colleagues at

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,920
microsoft and github and google

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,799
um and uh we created the open

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,000
source security foundation open ssf and

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,040
so that's where i've been

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,560
spending most of my time lately um

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,520
and so without further ado why is this

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,560
not working

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,479
um so so let's start with you know uh

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
somebody that i worked with way back in

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,159
the day when i worked at

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,360
sun microsystems i worked with this guy

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,399
here bill joy

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,439
um you may know him uh he's

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,560
uh sort of the inventor of bsd

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,960
and um he had a saying

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,960
that no matter who you are most of the

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,319
smartest people work for somebody else

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,160
we call this joy's law and what he's

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,120
really trying to say here is that

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,280
um you know even you know a company the

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,280
size of a google or an amazon or

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
microsoft or an ibm

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,800
doesn't have all the smart people there

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,000
are more smart people that work for the

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,319
other companies than

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
work for your own and so when you think

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,920
about how this

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
impacts innovation it really means that

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,920
if you're

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,680
if your competitors are collaborating

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,480
together out in the open

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,920
uh then you're at a distinct

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,879
disadvantage if you're not

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,040
playing in that same party and then eric

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,560
raymond back in 1997 had a very

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,720
prescient

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,879
uh quote from from his paper the

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,720
cathedral on the bazaar

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,800
perhaps in the end the open source

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,239
cultural triumph simply because the

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,879
close source world cannot

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,560
win an evolutionary arms race with open

00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,920
source communities that can put orders

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,400
of magnitude more skilled

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,440
time into a problem and this is

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,239
essentially

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,400
this is this is the the reason i think

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,599
in in many regards as to why

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,000
open source is succeeding um and and

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,319
is really starting into to sort of eat

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,480
away at the proprietary software

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,080
um era so why do

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,760
you know why do people choose open

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,040
source well you know there's perception

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,400
that there's a

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,400
better there's more of a speed of

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
innovation going on in the various open

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
source communities

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,560
um again when you're collaborating with

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,640
even your fiercest competitors

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,920
in building something like the container

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,959
orchestration service and

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,879
in kubernetes um you're going to be

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,720
innovating much more quickly than if

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,879
any one of those companies were to try

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,000
to do it all on their own

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,480
um there's a potential cost savings for

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,720
development so if you're incorporating

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,560
open source into the applications or

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,640
solutions that you're building

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
you're not having to spend time

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,120
developing that component that you

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,879
incorporate that is based on open source

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,159
um you're you're getting that from the

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,599
community um

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,519
and if you're doing it right then you're

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,519
also helping to contribute back

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,599
uh either development documentation bug

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,040
fixes and testing and so forth

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,280
um you know so you know

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,959
you know uh i think you know from my

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,359
perspective i always think about this in

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,759
the in

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,199
in the in the in the sense that um you

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,040
know if it's already been invented i'm

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,080
not really interested in doing it again

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,680
right

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,520
i'm i'm more interested in solving

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,680
problems that haven't been solved

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,120
um and then enterprise companies that

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,880
look for interoperability and

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,759
essentially you can look at open source

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,120
as sort of the next

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,880
wave of how we do sort of

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
open standards right when you think

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,880
about the whole purpose of developing

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,479
open standards is to deliver

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,880
interoperability

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,080
um and freedom from vendor lock-in right

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,880
so you know back in the day i work with

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,000
microsoft on developing some of the xml

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,400
web services

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,320
standards and the whole point there was

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,880
to drive interoperability between the

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,479
ibm world and the microsoft worlds

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,320
and our customers were really you know

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,479
100 behind that

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,919
um but now we're seeing you know

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,960
everything's moving to the cloud

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,479
and and yet there is no you know

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,720
there's much more of a sense that people

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,400
are selecting multiple different clouds

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,080
for their deployments

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,960
and so as a result you're looking for

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,479
interoperability and portability between

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,479
uh different cloud platforms

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,720
[Music]

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,479
so what are the benefits to developers

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,199
well and this is again this is taken

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,039
from some

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,560
some charts that i've presented in the

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,160
past

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
but basically open source gives you

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,840
improved skills um it gives you support

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,800
and you can sort of increase your your

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,919
technical eminence in those communities

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,520
through participation in in open source

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,520
so again it's an accelerant innovation

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,800
you're not having to reinvent the wheel

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,360
so to speak

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,639
um it gives you access to experienced

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
technologists so

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,600
you know one of the things that's really

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
great about open source is that you can

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
be rubbing elbows and working side by

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,919
side

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,919
and getting you know constructive

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,840
feedback in code reviews

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,919
from some of the most experienced

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,840
technologists on the planet

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,280
um and they don't have to be working for

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
the same company as you you could be

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,720
working for some

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,400
small startup and yet rubbing elbows and

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,319
getting advice and

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,759
and coaching and mentoring and and

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,080
critical reviews

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,039
from somebody who's working uh has been

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,479
working at a company like a google or

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,479
or a microsoft or an ibm

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,319
and and we're finding that again open

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,840
source communities are starting to

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
become these sort of interactive hubs

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,039
for developers it's where they can sort

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,759
of get together

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,560
and show off their skills their their

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,759
subject

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,199
matter knowledge and so forth um uh

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,280
whether it's in these various

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,199
conferences that are held as a result

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,639
of you know organizing around these

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,240
communities

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,560
or whether it's just in the community

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,240
development process itself

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,160
it helps you build that technical

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,080
eminence

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,560
amongst your peers and this is important

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,240
to you know your future

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,560
job prospects why does open source

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,639
matter at ibm well

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
you know from our perspective again it's

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,840
improved products and offerings it's

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,240
improved performance

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,360
of our ability to deliver capability

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,440
quickly

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
um and it's and it's a source for

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,120
skilled uh resources

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,120
from skilled developers and and

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
advocates and so forth

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,880
um you know again being able to deliver

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,000
trusted scalable secure services is

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,160
really important

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,160
and again if you start as a founder with

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,639
a foundation of open source such as we

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,680
have with kubernetes for instance in our

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,960
openshift offerings in our ibm cloud

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,160
um it gives us a head start and then we

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,479
can focus on

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,560
not reinventing the same set of wheels

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,639
that does container orchestration

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,919
but focusing on the user experience for

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,599
instance and making that a little bit

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,440
simpler for people

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,720
um it gives us the ability to deliver

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,919
innovative and highly scalable

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,000
performant technologies

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,479
again we talked about kube um but it's

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,120
the same thing for

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,199
ai and machine learning capabilities

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,599
many of those that are incorporated into

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,400
for instance ibm's cloud pack for data

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,400
are based on open source technologies um

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,039
or are just the open source technologies

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,919
themselves in many cases

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,560
and again it helps our developers

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,599
maintain

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,599
and and sort of grow in their skill set

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,440
by con you know contributing out into

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,760
these open source communities so

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,120
so we see this as a unique opportunity

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,560
for ibm

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
so this was you know it's like i said

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,000
this i've been saying this now for

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
i can't remember how long but you know

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,120
for quite some time when i talk to

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,800
clients and when i talk to

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,560
at conferences and so forth um but

00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,560
last year um i think you know probably

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,800
in the early fall time period

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,320
um i came across a piece of click bait

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,240
that was basically saying

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
oh my god you know if you're a developer

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,000
you need to know these 10 apis

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
and it was amazon this amazon that

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,880
amazon the other thing

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,360
and i was really annoyed at that because

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,360
as a developer that's not the thing

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
that's necessarily from my perspective

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,240
that's not necessarily the thing that i

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
need to know

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,920
if i'm going to get a job because not

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
everybody uses amazon i guess it's a

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,320
very popular cloud platform

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,000
but not everybody uses amazon and

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,120
certainly not everybody uses amazon

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,120
exclusively

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,399
and so what's really motivating

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,760
developers i thought

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
was no i think it's really the

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,000
underlying open source

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
that fuels a lot of these cloud

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,839
platforms

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,240
that really matters and not necessarily

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,160
the

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,800
vendor-specific apis that adorn them and

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,600
so

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,760
i got together with some colleagues in

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,480
ibm's market development insights

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,160
and um you know we pitched the idea we

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,399
should do a study to find out

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,399
exactly what is it that's motivating

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,519
developers right do developers really

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,959
think that they should know a

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,560
proprietary

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,640
api over the underlying open source apis

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,160
um what's important from their

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
perspective of you know from a career

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,320
building perspective

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,600
um what motivates hiring managers into

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,640
hiring somebody is it

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,519
their knowledge of the underlying uh

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,040
proprietary apis or is it the knowledge

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,000
of the underlying open source that's

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,360
really important

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,320
to um to hiring managers and so we um

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,120
we worked with o'reilly to develop um a

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,720
survey

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,880
that went out and we we talked to um

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,279
it's uh three 3441

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,800
um respondents there was actually a few

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,480
more than that

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,160
but not all of the responses were

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,320
complete so we only took all of the

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,720
complete ones but

00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,560
basically just over 3 400 respondents

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,079
sort of a variety that i'll show you in

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,079
a second you know sort of the

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,320
the mix of of who who we were talking to

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,519
um and uh you know we asked them a

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,839
series of questions

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,240
relating to the the topic i just i just

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,680
approached um what do we find

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
so the majority think that knowledge of

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,160
and or contribute contributions

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,600
to open source um are much more

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,680
important to their careers

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
than um and their professional

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,519
opportunities then

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,440
are you know focusing exclusively on

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,959
proprietary apis

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
so that's that's sort of the most

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,720
important thing i think that

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,720
you know we learned from from this study

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,399
um you know obviously i think there's a

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,000
lot of the

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,079
the the same things that we just talked

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
about you know people are looking to

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,360
open source software because it gives

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,600
you certain guarantees

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,040
uh or certain mitigations against uh

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,040
vendor lock-in

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,160
um there's lower cost involved because

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,560
you can actually

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,440
download your the software for free

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,160
again it doesn't

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,600
it's free as in as in as in beer there's

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,040
obviously some support costs and so

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,000
forth associated with

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,959
operational costs um but it's also the

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,480
ability to sort of

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,160
build on and leverage the ideas and

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,959
innovation from a large community

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,279
right um and so that's really i think

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,000
the

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,399
the attractiveness of of you know why

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,200
why developers feel that it's important

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,120
um two-thirds of the developers

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,800
considered the skills related to the

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,839
underlying open source as being more

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,839
important

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,120
than the proprietary platforms

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,760
themselves

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,440
um and so linux and kubernetes are much

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,079
more beneficial

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,959
than the proprietary apis that the cloud

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,720
providers

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,480
offer and then you know in terms of

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,160
which of the technologies from an open

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,320
source perspective are

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,560
most significant most important to

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,240
developers and to the hiring managers

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,839
in terms of experience looking you know

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,279
looking for experience in their in

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,480
in their potential hirings linux

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,680
itself was number one containers

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,200
obviously came in close second databases

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,519
were perceived as more important and

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,360
then

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,639
it sort of trickled down to you know

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,040
various other specific

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,839
technologies um but you know again when

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,600
we think about

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,440
you know developing from a cloud native

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,760
perspective and from a

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,959
data an ai machine learning perspective

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,440
you know these are the things that

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,320
really

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,880
are the underlying powerhouses for for

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,480
that

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,720
that type of development um

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,560
and and basically about 50 of the

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,079
developers consider that their knowledge

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,720
and their experience with these

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,959
technologies had resulted in higher pay

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,320
um and so that's that's really sort of

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,959
the the gist of it

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,720
you know as i mentioned um we wanted to

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,839
understand the value of open source to

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,600
developers

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,680
um when we when we went out there so

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,639
that was the primary motivation behind

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,760
the study

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,279
um i mentioned we have a total of 3 41

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,880
participants

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,560
in the study itself um about 50

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,160
identified themselves as software

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,480
engineers or architects

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,000
um and you know devops and so forth and

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,160
then you know the others were hiring

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,120
managers and so forth we have a breadth

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,279
of coverage from large enterprises from

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,040
mid-market companies and smaller

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,120
isvs um and and smaller companies

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,320
um and again the responses were pretty

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,320
much consistent across

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,800
all the different um uh dimensions here

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,639
i i will they'll highlight a couple of

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,480
important distinctions

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,839
in terms of the responses when you sort

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,320
of drill down into the

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,160
to the details of the study itself where

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,600
we find that some hiring managers are

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,600
actually more bullish

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,040
on open source than the developers

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,480
themselves so again

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,440
it's a it's a strong signal for

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,040
um you know where things are are heading

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,160
um so again you know we talked about

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,480
this you know what

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,079
what are the benefits of of open source

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,399
over proprietary software and

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,680
and this is pretty stark you know the

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,079
the

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,199
differentiation here you know minimizing

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:06,000
vendor lock and you know basically 85

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,800
um of the the respondents felt that it

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,800
was

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,800
um uh either

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,199
losing uh oh here we go somewhat

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,000
so you know whether it's strongly

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,800
associated uh or somewhat associated

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,279
um versus disassociated so you know

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,279
again

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,480
you know these are that that's a

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,680
significant

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,079
uh data point there and then you know

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
people

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,959
basically felt that well obviously if

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
you're dealing with vendor-specific

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,680
stuff

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
you're not necessarily minimizing your

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,440
vendor lock-in

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,639
um there's a lower cost perception i

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,160
think again

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,000
this is one of those this is one of

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,240
those areas where you know obviously

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
it's it's open source it's free you can

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,639
download it doesn't cost you a nickel

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,160
um and you can just deploy it in your

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,160
enterprise but then there's always the

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,279
day two operational aspects of things

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,360
how are you going to patch it how are

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,320
you going to support it going forward

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,920
um that's that doesn't come for free um

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,839
so there is a certain support cost

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,160
associated with it but certainly

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,959
i think many still perceive that even

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,279
adding in

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,079
the sort of the the day to operational

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,480
support

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,600
and uh and and support and development

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,560
uh cases

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,959
that um uh it's still lower cost than

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,519
than

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,120
than proprietary software offerings um

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,360
again there's another catch of that i

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
think increasingly people do

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,440
sort of hit that threshold where they

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,279
realize what they really want is they

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,199
want the open source for the benefits

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,560
the other benefits that we see here

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,720
um but they're they're looking for

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,920
somebody to help them with the support

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,120
um and services of the uh the technology

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,959
itself

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,279
um 76 think it makes me

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,399
feel like i'm part of a community and i

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,160
think that's

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,759
even if you're just a user of the

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,600
software and not contributing back

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,199
and participating actively out in the

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,920
open source community

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,759
um it there's a certain affiliation with

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,279
that broader community if you're if

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,800
you're in the user community and

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,839
sometimes you end up going

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,839
to well maybe not now with the covid

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,439
but you know in the past you know people

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,799
would show up at conferences that aren't

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,000
necessarily contributing in the

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,360
community but they're using the

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,839
technology and they

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,360
they want to learn more they want to rub

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,919
elbows with the people that are building

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,160
it

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,839
um so there is a strong sense of

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,280
community associated with open source

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,480
there isn't really with

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,919
proprietary software um it provides

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,000
incentive to innovate and again you know

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,919
this is one of those things that i think

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,679
you know people underestimate is that

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,760
you know because open source you know it

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,760
gives you the ability to fork it you can

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,360
you can you can actually take something

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
and then you can build a derivative of

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,520
that

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,520
you can build on the shoulders of giants

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,960
as i say um

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,640
and come up with something new and

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,520
important and and improved in

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,000
some in some way it makes my job more

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,280
meaningful

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,640
so 66 almost two-thirds say uh that it

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,200
it makes them uh feel more meaningful

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,160
in in terms of their job um prevent

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,720
silos again a slightly lesser percentage

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,360
um thinks that it prevents silos again

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,760
the the

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,480
the proprietary software in the red

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,440
there

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,679
um is still trickling down in the single

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,600
digits

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,960
um more support available this is again

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,400
this is the point that i was making

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,919
above

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,720
in that you know again um there is

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,559
there's an increasing awareness of the

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,720
fact that you can actually get

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,720
fairly decent support from the community

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,880
whether it's the documentation

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,400
whether it's uh you know seeking you

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,400
know filing an issue and getting a

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,200
response and getting a bug fixed and so

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,240
forth

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,799
um many of the uh more vibrant

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,120
and diverse and and uh sort of popular

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,320
communities are very effective

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,480
at delivering essential support

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,320
um you know not necessarily the same

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,160
that you would expect from a vendor

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,200
um and certainly the vendor software

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,320
about 35 percent there think that it's

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,200
more strongly associated with you know

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,880
with vendor-specific technologies but

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,080
again increasingly i think people are

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
looking to

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,520
um uh vendors providing support for the

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,480
open source right in the red hat sort of

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,000
model of

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,240
providing a subscription to an

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,360
underlying software package

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,840
um more reliable more error you know

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,240
less error prone and so forth i think

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,919
again increasingly people are looking at

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,960
open source as providing that you know

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,320
with the

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,480
um you know the old saying um of

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,360
many eyes makes all bugs shallow it's

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,360
not

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,440
totally true it's you know there are

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,760
always bugs in software

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,600
it's the nature of the game um but

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,360
increasingly you know especially as

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,120
communities focus on things like

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,039
improving security and

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,160
improving their their testing and so

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,559
forth um

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,240
you know generally um people are finding

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,679
that open source tends to be

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,360
much more reliable robust than

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,960
even their proprietary offerings and

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,559
then easier to use and i think again

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,600
this this comes from the perspective

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,720
that

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,799
because you can engage with the

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,400
community it's easier to get feedback

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,960
into the development cycle

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
and so ease of use comes out uh

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,120
oftentimes

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,240
in in dealing with that

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,240
okay um other key requirements

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,159
technology flexibility

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,360
right um and again this is where you

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,960
know you think about from an open source

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,679
perspective you actually have access to

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,320
the software

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,880
you know and so you can maybe configure

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,520
it

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,760
to suit your specific needs uh you can

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,840
augment it you can build on top of it

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,679
right so it's much more flexible than

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,480
proprietary software that you don't have

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,799
the software

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,480
you know you don't have the code for um

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,159
and your you've got to sort of

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,000
adapt to whatever apis they give you um

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,760
developer satisfaction again most

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,360
developers prefer to work with

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,320
open source than with proprietary

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,000
software again speed of development the

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,720
quality of the code we talked about that

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,200
security

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,760
is another important thing um although

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,760
again it's not something that's perfect

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,960
um you know but it is something that

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,400
increasingly

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,000
more and more people are starting to

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,120
think very long and hard about securing

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,760
the open source supply chains if you

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,000
will

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,880
especially in light of things like the

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,080
several winds

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,240
incident functionality

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,600
again people think that you know from a

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,360
perspective of

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,760
providing the functionality that they

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,280
need they get better response from open

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,440
source software

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,960
um better performance and stability from

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,039
open source and

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,880
then again we have the support which

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,799
works in the other direction

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,640
um you know when you buy something from

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,640
a vendor you know they're signing up to

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,880
give you full-blown support

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,159
and services around that capability that

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,960
technology

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,720
um and so they're on the hook uh but i

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,360
think that trend is moving in the right

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,000
direction

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,120
where more and more you know people are

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,880
looking for support

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,320
for the open source and not for

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,320
proprietary um

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,559
derivative of that um

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,799
open source skills are more beneficial

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,880
to people's careers than skills related

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,600
specific cloud platforms

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,919
this was again this is the the the sort

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,440
of

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,120
the crux of what it was that i was

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,240
hoping to hear

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,679
um and and it and it sort of paid out

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,360
you know in spades here um 65

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,440
think that open source is much more

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,600
beneficial to their careers

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,799
than dealing and acquiring skills

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,720
related to specific

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:33,120
platforms um which was 35

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,400
um and so this again this makes me feel

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,120
good

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,840
because uh i get to say i told you so

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,400
right

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,159
um but it's uh it's actually it's

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,760
interesting from the perspective that if

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,520
you're a developer

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,440
and you you have to sort of make some

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,960
choices in your life about you know so

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,039
what am i going to pursue

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,559
what skills am i going to acquire to

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,039
make my

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,880
job prospects better and so forth um

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,039
this gives you a pretty clear picture of

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,960
where you should be focusing

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,720
um again two-thirds of developers would

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,120
prefer to work with an open source-based

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,679
cloud

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,280
platform um you know so so that's

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,039
that's significant right that's

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,240
significant um

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,240
you know you might get better

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,640
performance out of somebody's

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,240
you know platform uh that's you know

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,720
based on closed source

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,400
but the reality of it is actually that

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,679
increasingly more and more of the cloud

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,600
platforms that are available

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,520
are based on the underlying open source

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,799
of something like kubernetes certainly

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,080
most of them are delivering linux

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,559
based uh operating system

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,320
um having experience with open source

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,200
provides greater long-term value for my

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,840
career

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,240
again you know i have to move something

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,679
here

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,440
by 70

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,919
you know 67 uh think that it's important

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,919
for

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:58,720
uh long-term career prospects um

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,039
69 this is this is an interesting one

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,559
because again this is something that

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,559
i've certainly believed for quite some

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,559
time and it's really great to see the

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,080
feedback coming from developers and from

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,480
hiring managers

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,440
um that actually contributions to open

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,799
source

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,200
resulted in better professional

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,120
opportunities and i think that this is

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,960
this is another important trend because

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,600
we're seeing more recently

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,120
that it's not just the vendors that are

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,279
contributing into these open source

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,559
communities it's actually the users

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,480
that are bringing some of the best

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,080
feedback um

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,679
and you know whether they're working for

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,760
a large

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,200
financial institution or whether they're

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,360
working in healthcare

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,360
or supply chain what have you

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,600
they're starting to become more and more

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,279
engaged directly in the upstream open

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,240
source projects that they're basing

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,200
their

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,200
their solutions on

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,559
contributions open source provide more

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,440
visibility and speaking opportunities in

00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,640
my area of expertise again 67

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,039
this is important um using open source

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,279
helps

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,480
attracts talent now again this is

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,080
something that i think

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,760
you know i i've certainly believed for

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,840
some time um

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:15,200
you know and i'm not a hiring manager

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,520
um and but i do know uh very many of

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,159
them

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,600
and i do know that many of them do look

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,400
when when they're looking to hire

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,720
somebody

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,400
they check to see are you involved in an

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
open source community you know what's

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,240
your commit

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,840
history look like um you know and and

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,520
they may even ask around

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,760
um in those communities you know what do

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,600
you think about so-and-so

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,720
so it is uh increasingly important um

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,919
and and this is actually one of those

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,880
one of those points that i think um

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,919
actually turns out that um the hiring

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,000
managers actually

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,480
felt uh more strongly about this

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
than the developers themselves so again

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,679
it's another

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,520
sort of data point that you know i think

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,400
is important to take away from this

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,039
is that hiring managers are they're on

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,799
board

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,960
and so as developers you need to think

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,240
about so what are the hiring managers

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,000
interested in so there's some really

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,120
interesting data points in this report

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,799
about that um

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,960
so contributions to open source and

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,480
press potential employers

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,279
and often result in better job

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,960
opportunities again 65

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,799
you know very uh very important there

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,400
what else we have using open source

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,159
increases respect and credibility with

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,080
my peers yes

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,840
um open source experience and skills are

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,720
usually an important factor to determine

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,640
who to hire

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,960
and again this is another one of those

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,039
data points that you know

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,799
hiring managers felt more strongly by

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,600
about five percent

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,320
um generally across the board than the

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,120
developers

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,000
themselves um again another another

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,080
interesting

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,400
sort of uh point here um

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,080
so again you know just sort of repeating

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,640
this and this this breaks it down then

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,480
into so what technologies are

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,720
people you know our developers you know

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,240
focused on from a career perspective

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,799
so linux you know 80 right um

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,240
and you know again 68 felt that it's

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,440
really really important to

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,159
have proficient proficiency and and be a

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,080
subject matter

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,159
expert around linux um and then 57

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,720
felt that it helped them get higher pay

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,080
by becoming an expert in linux

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,080
uh databases came in at number two um it

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,080
was 70

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:37,279
um containers close behind the 68

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,039
um and again you know this is a newer

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,960
set of technologies and so we're still

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,600
growing our proficiency

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,399
and set of subject matter experts around

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,720
this

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,000
but again very similar levels of you

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,880
know yeah this has definitely

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,440
helped me uh and get higher pay and so

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,640
forth

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,080
container orchestration around

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,720
kubernetes here um again 52

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,520
um again slightly newer um but again

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,320
it's becoming

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,720
more and more important and then ai came

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,000
in

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,960
uh in fifth place here um technologies

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,760
like istio

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,080
and k native and so forth were um you

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,159
know

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,760
lesser to lesser degree again they're

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,840
much newer

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:21,440
not quite as well known um generally

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,840
and but still

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,760
you know when i look back in the report

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,679
and dig into the details

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,840
um you know the these levels here

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,000
down to kubernetes are still greater

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,880
than the developers responded yeah

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,679
i need to know you know aws or i need to

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,960
know azure

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,880
and so forth um which were less than 50

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,240
percent

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,880
um 87 percent of hiring managers

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,399
consider

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,320
applicants knowledge of open source in

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:53,039
their hiring decisions

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,080
that's amazing when you think about it

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,320
um

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,320
and then you know the the 2020 open

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,200
source jobs report um

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,279
actually had sort of very similar data

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,120
in it that reinforced saying that

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,640
um 93 of hiring managers

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,399
said that they're finding it difficult

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,159
to find the talent with the open source

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:16,080
skills that they're looking for

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,320
which is up five percent from 2018

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,440
um and that hiring managers report that

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,399
knowledge of open source

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,159
is the most significant impact with 70

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,760
more likely to hire a pro with open

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,960
source skills

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,240
up from 66 in 2018. so again this is

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,240
this is clearly sort of uh you know

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,799
reinforcing and ratifying the same

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,679
findings

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,240
there we go okay um and again hiring

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,600
managers considering oss important from

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,840
in in terms of hiring decisions um again

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,279
um sort of the same sort of set of

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,080
numbers but again

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,240
in both cases you know whether it's

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,159
attracting talent or whether it's

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,360
you know the skills that they're looking

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,480
for when they're hiring

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,919
um hiring managers by about five percent

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,640
in both cases

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,320
uh felt more strongly than the

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,559
developers themselves

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,559
so developers take note

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
um what it so what's open source good at

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,360
or excelling at

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,600
um again 88 felt that it um

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,039
was leveraging ideas and innovation from

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,399
a larger community so

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,720
again you know it sort of reinforces

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,520
that notion that open source is the fuel

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,039
for

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,760
much of the innovation that goes on

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,440
these days minimizing vendor lock-in we

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,440
talked about that

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,960
enabling choice of deployment platforms

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,279
again as i mentioned

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,720
um and it's actually also reinforced in

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,600
another report that just came out

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,200
yesterday and i

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,520
didn't have time to put the link in and

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,559
so forth but um

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,960
the red hat enterprise open source

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,600
study their third year in a row now came

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,799
out and it's basically reinforcing

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,640
that about two-thirds of respondents are

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,519
saying that they're using multiple

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,279
clouds

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,880
so being able to sort of have the

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,880
ability to do either

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,559
portability or certainly portability of

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,399
skills across a number of different

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,919
cloud platforms

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,679
is critically important to many

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,919
enterprises

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,039
it's compatible with my enterprise it

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,440
environment

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,200
um again what we're finding is and this

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,880
and this is another one of those areas

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,240
where the hiring managers actually felt

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,360
more strongly

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,080
um you know when when we looked at

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,720
in the report you know who's using open

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,279
source in your enterprise hiring manager

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,720
actually

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,720
had a stronger um opinion about

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,200
how much they were using it um and it

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,440
was you know significantly more

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,399
than the the general population of the

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,399
study

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:50,480
um and so it's important to their

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,799
to their hiring decisions because that's

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,799
basically what's in their enterprise

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,080
shortening time to value against 72

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,159
percent and then

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,519
uh time to problem resolution and the

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,679
support thing

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,559
it's something that's being worked um

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,240
and again i think

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,840
increasingly you're finding that some

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,720
vendors are providing

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,960
support um or subscription support for

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,880
open source itself without sort of any

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:19,039
kind of proprietary wrapper

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,880
um so um you know sort of coming to a

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,919
conclusion here so enterprise

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,279
uh you know i should say technology

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,039
consumers

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,640
do more than just consume open source

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,120
if they're going to be effective

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,760
participants in this in this community

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,440
ibm's got a long and i think very

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,000
positive history

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,600
in open source i like to say that we've

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,720
been doing open source since before it

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,080
was cool

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,000
um if you're if you're as old as me

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,279
you know i can say that but basically we

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,559
were doing open source

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:55,440
even before red hat came into existence

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,200
we had ibm engineers and research and in

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
um in some of the systems divisions that

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,960
were working on

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,080
linux um in the very very early days of

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,440
linux we were

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,320
working uh on developing the apache http

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,799
server

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,080
you know back in the day as well and and

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,159
we helped to found

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,240
the apache software foundation the linux

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,919
foundation the eclipse foundation

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,880
um you know and then you sort of fast

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:22,000
forward openstack so i was there with

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,480
you know the att's and and um

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,039
intel's and others that you know sort of

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,559
went all

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:31,279
in on openstack um you know um

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,240
uh what was it now it's about eight nine

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,360
years ago

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,519
it seems like yesterday um uh

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,080
creating the openstack foundation i

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,799
worked with the pivotal folk to help to

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,120
stand up the cloud foundry foundation

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,760
um you know we were involved in creating

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,120
the cloud native computing foundation

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,399
i helped to set up hyperledger um

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,600
you know openjs foundation graphql

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,919
nigeria you know

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,399
various of these communities ibm has

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,919
been a significant contributor to and in

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,880
many cases we actually

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,080
contributed significant amounts of both

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,560
resource as well as

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,879
uh intellectual property to get these uh

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,480
organizations up off the ground

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,560
pardon me so you know it's it's really

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,560
important to sort of complete that

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,879
virtuous cycle

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,720
of contribution and not just consumption

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,560
and in fact one of the points in the

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,280
report actually does highlight the fact

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,480
that

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,119
um that it's important that you're

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,079
seen as contributing to open source as a

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,440
vendor

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,000
um because it it's the the sense there

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,679
is that

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,119
if you're delivering capability based on

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,720
that open source it's much better if

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,520
you're actually contributing

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,359
and so our our our strategy this is our

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,760
strategy in a nutshell is that we have

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,839
this

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,159
hybrid cloud platform of red hat open

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,200
shift and enterprise linux

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,280
as a foundation for a number of

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,879
uh capabilities that we deliver through

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,200
the ibm cloud packs

00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:02,640
various other sas software offerings

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,119
on the ibm cloud and or on the

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,880
in in software delivery and you know

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,760
with services built on top of all of

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,320
that

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,359
um that it's it's all really when you

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,359
when you sort of

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,000
drill down into the heart of all of this

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,160
it's really all about open source

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,839
um and and that's accelerating even

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,040
further which makes me

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,800
very happy um

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,400
and again we feel that this actually

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,320
creates a better value for

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,240
for clients right when it's open you

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,000
know um it

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,680
you're harnessing the innovation in the

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,640
open source communities

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,440
um and we we differentiate on top of

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,520
that but again

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,960
the underlying apis or something like

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,440
openshift

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,000
are kubernetes and you can use the raw

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,280
kubernetes

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,960
apis right out of the box um so

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,880
you know again this is you know sort of

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,000
fulfilling

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,440
uh the the dream that i had when we went

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,720
to to market

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,520
um you know that sort of reinforces my

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,640
sense of where the world was uh makes me

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,400
me feel good

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,960
and hopefully it makes you feel good and

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,880
and uh and hopefully it makes you think

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,000
about you know the value of open source

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,440
to your own careers

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,880
and to your own teams as you're thinking

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,960
about hiring

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,880
um so you know reiterating what do we

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,400
learn again majority think that

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,119
knowledge of and contributions open

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,200
source

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,720
give you much better long-term job

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,320
prospects

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,920
and professional opportunities to grow

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,359
within your companies

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,040
um uh it benefits um

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,839
the the benefits i should say of open

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,640
source you know i think

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,079
are well you know reinforced with the

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,599
findings in the study

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,440
two-thirds of developers think that

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,200
skills related underlying open source is

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,560
much more important than the

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,920
um proprietary counterparts containers

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,320
databases

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,520
and ai are perceived as the most

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,880
important technologies

00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:00,240
to know and then

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,520
again about 50 50 just over 50 percent

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,359
thought that knowledge of these

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,480
technologies has resulted in higher pay

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,000
and so with that i think i'll turn to

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,440
questions

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,640
i think we have about 10 minutes left

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,119
great yeah we have uh one here it says i

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,839
noticed that the skills of open source

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,000
and around

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,320
open source tools are more and more

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,760
needed in telecommunications

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,440
what do you think about building

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,680
competencies around

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,240
open telecommunication architects like

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,240
openram

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,960
um i think that again whatever you know

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,880
whatever domain it is

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,680
i think that the open um uh

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,000
sort of side of that if if you will um

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,560
is

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,359
probably the one where if i were you

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,800
know beginning

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,760
my career that's where i would focus um

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,520
i think you know again the the the

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,640
choice of you know which

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,480
industry um you know which which uh

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,240
vertical you want to focus in is

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,560
probably yours but

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,440
um yeah i mean i think i think

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,839
definitely

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,800
um focusing in on communities that are

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,680
focused on

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,359
delivering open source um uh

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,960
capabilities to a given

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,599
uh technology domain are are going to be

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,280
more successful than focusing on

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,240
proprietary solutions

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,839
and you know again you're seeing again

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,359
in many cases

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,960
you're seeing in the telecommunications

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,720
industry for instance you're seeing the

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,480
att's in the horizon and so forth

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,640
they're engaged in these open source

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,440
communities um around networking and so

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,920
forth so

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,920
absolutely

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,839
okay great um this next one is a little

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,160
bit long so bear with me

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:49,920
um it says since 2018

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,640
at least five multi-billion dollar

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,680
companies redis labs cockroach labs

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,280
confluent publicly traded mongodb and

00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,200
recently elastic

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,200
have changed their software licenses to

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,000
block amazon from reselling their

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,280
software

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,880
to aws's massive customer base

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,119
representing a combined market

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,720
capitalization of about 42 billion

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,880
dollars

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,000
with the inclusion of elastic these

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,320
companies appear to be

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,040
driving momentum in favor of business

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,839
models

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,000
built around more restrictive licensing

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,839
and sending a signal to emerging open

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,920
source startups seeking to compete with

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,160
amazon's cloud division

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,119
do you see a battle over open source

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,359
business models

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,680
and movement towards more restrictive

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:37,040
licensing

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,880
so you know this is one of those this is

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,320
a really good question

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,000
and it's very topical um

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,760
i think you know many would say that

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,880
open source isn't a business model

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,800
and i think that's correct um but what

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,520
is a business model is what do you do

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,960
with

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,119
um the software and delivering a service

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,119
um you know whether it's a sas offering

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,800
or delivering a software offering

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,960
and this you know the services and

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,520
support around it

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,200
are real that's where the real value is

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,319
not so much the code

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,160
and again the value of open source is in

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,760
the community

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,599
um that builds up around it um

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,520
you know i i'm not going to you know

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:23,119
pick on any particular

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,240
vendors um in in this particular case

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,359
but i will just say

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,359
that um

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,800
there there are some who are

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,800
takers if you will you know some who are

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,160
basically just exploiting the fact that

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,359
here's this free thing and i'm just

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,000
going to go use it

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:47,680
and contribute very little in the way of

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:52,079
the virtuous cycle of contribution back

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:55,520
and i think that's sad it's a reality um

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,599
but again um it's it's it's not

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,400
something to be solved necessarily by

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,599
changing

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,920
um one's license um to make it

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,440
essentially not open source

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,720
[Music]

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,800
because then you're essentially cutting

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,599
off the uh the contributions and so

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,200
forth

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,640
because developers are looking for the

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,359
ability to contribute back

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,480
the ability to know that uh they're

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,160
contributing to something that they

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,960
could use that they could fork that they

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,400
could

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,720
um uh you know they can do so without

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,920
you know sort of following a foul of the

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,720
license

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,599
um and so you know i'll just say again

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,079
you know and i

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,680
highlighted the fact that ibm has been i

00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,440
think a very good partner from an open

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,800
source perspective because we have been

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,560
contributing back

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,160
uh for so long and certainly you know

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,920
from a red hat perspective

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,240
that's their that is their business

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,800
model you know everything that red hat

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,079
does

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,119
is based on upstream software upstream

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,480
open source software um and yet they're

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,960
doing pretty well

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,880
from a business perspective now are they

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,280
exclusively the developers

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,880
for something you know no they they try

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,520
to build communities that's the whole

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,560
point

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,560
is building a diverse community um and

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,200
and making it so that you know becoming

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,280
part of that community is an important

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,640
uh is is important to its exploitation

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,839
um and so yeah it's it's sad when we see

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,000
you know those examples that you gave um

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,200
uh and uh i don't i don't like it any

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,079
more than any of them

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,440
do right but the reality of it is i

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,079
don't think it's the license that

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,200
matters

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,599
i think again it's the community um

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,240
and you know anytime you try and retain

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,920
control

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,920
that's when you tend to lose it

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,280
okay great we have about five minutes

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,880
left but we have a whole bunch of

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,000
questions here to get through so i will

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,760
try to get through

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,760
them all david says apologies if i miss

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,480
something but how many companies

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,960
extend software asset management and

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,520
license management to oss

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,520
if they don't does this cause problems

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,359
and how many companies are confident

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,440
about what oss they have

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,480
where it is and what depends on it like

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,599
oss config

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,560
management this is a really really good

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,720
point i didn't

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,240
i didn't bring it up it's not really a

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,760
focus of the study but

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,960
you know establishing a practice within

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,640
your organization

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,119
for effectively managing monitoring

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,839
and providing sort of policy-based

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,319
governance around the open source

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,760
that you both consume as well as

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,480
contribute to

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,800
i think is fundamentally important and

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,200
it's one of the things that i talk to

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,800
with clients about all the time right

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,920
they they're asking

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,599
how does ibm deal with open source

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,200
um and you know some of them are coming

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,960
at it from you know sort of

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,480
the license aspect of things right how

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,760
do we not run a foul of

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,000
you know doing the wrong thing from a

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,440
licensing perspective but it's also

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,200
i think fundamentally important to

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,960
understand so what technology

00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,400
what open source technology have you

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,720
consumed in

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,480
developing your application your

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,079
solutioning you know in your in your

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,920
data center and so forth

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,359
um so that you can understand so that

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,400
when there is a vulnerability that's

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,720
reported

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,760
how can i get it patched and should i be

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,319
you know establishing

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,560
sort of a practice for ensuring that you

00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,280
know if there's a

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,720
you know a zero day uh vulnerability

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,680
published you know that i'm

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,960
acting quickly to remediate that in my

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,480
in my enterprise

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,640
by having a clear understanding about

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,319
where is something being used

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,000
and so there are there are vendors out

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,160
there that provide tooling

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
um that allows you to sort of um you

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,480
know scan the software

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,200
build up a database of use and so forth

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,839
um

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,839
within your within your enterprise um

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,520
and i would highly encourage

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,880
you know every company to sort of

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,560
establish a

00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,040
what we call an open source program

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,760
office that essentially manages

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,480
um you know developing the policy and

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,160
and

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,720
and enforcing the policy to a certain

00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,440
extent um you know without it becoming

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,480
onerous

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,560
you know without it becoming an

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,560
impediment to getting anything done

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,920
um but having a clear appreciation for

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,040
what you have in your enterprise

00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,040
is very important

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,800
okay great and this is a more um sort of

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,839
general question

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,560
um how do we start contributing to open

00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,160
source as a person early in their career

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,680
how do we find the right projects to

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,520
start contributing to

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,000
should we look for an easy project to

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,240
start with or do we select a project

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,400
learn its design and source code and

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,800
then start contributing

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,960
now this is a great question and um

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,800
you know my answer to this would be pick

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,920
something that interests you

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,760
oftentimes the best

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,480
uh if you will um the the the interest

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
comes from

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,440
you know it's something that you're

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,000
using right there there's a saying you

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,800
know you're

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,680
you're scratching an itch right um and

00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,440
and that's where

00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:02,640
a lot of innovation comes from um and so

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,680
if you're using some technology or some

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,760
tool

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,440
um and you like that tool but you think

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,119
it could be a little bit better

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,760
right that might be a good place to

00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,720
start um you don't have to start with

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,839
you know necessarily writing code um

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,040
there are ways to

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,800
engage in communities that are not

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,440
always code-based so if you're a little

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,920
bit

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,480
sort of trepidatious and and you you

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,440
know you're

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,040
you're afraid of um uh you know that

00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,480
that you know somebody will laugh at

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,960
your code they won't trust me

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,720
um uh there are jerks out there

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,160
obviously but you know for the most part

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,280
people are very respectful in these

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,079
communities

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,599
um but you can start with you know maybe

00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,240
helping out from a documentation

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,319
perspective

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,400
again if you're a user then maybe you

00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,520
know better than others about how it

00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,560
should be used and how you should

00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,839
document it or

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,520
maybe you understand where the

00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:54,720
documentation is lacking and you can

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,560
help fill in some of the blanks there

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,800
another place that you can help out is

00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,119
just in triaging things right

00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,119
um you know going through an issues list

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,560
and making sure that the issue is both

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,079
well described but also

00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,200
provides with an ability to test

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:14,160
that the defect is in fact um uh

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,319
found um and so you can just help by

00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,640
triaging and saying yes this is

00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,880
um you know fully documented it provides

00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,280
the the testing necessary to sort of

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,240
prove

00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,359
that the defect is there um and you

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,960
don't have to fix it

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,040
but you can help by doing that bit of

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,160
triage and it helps the maintainers of

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,200
the community

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,559
um to be more efficient in responding to

00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,680
issues and so forth

00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:41,119
um so um you know again

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,480
there's uh there's no right or wrong

00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,119
answer here right it

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,559
you know there are some communities that

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,680
are so large it can be a little bit

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,599
overwhelming

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,119
uh then there are some that are so small

00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,000
that they can be you know kind of

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,480
crickets

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,839
if you will uh and not necessarily very

00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,680
responsive either

00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,359
you know finding you know the sort of

00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,359
doing the goldilocks thing of finding

00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,880
the one that's sort of just right

00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,480
again a lot of that is really going to

00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,520
be based on your own personal

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,800
preferences

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,160
the things that interest you and things

00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,400
maybe that you're using

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,040
are maybe where you know is the best

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,040
place to start

00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:24,800
great next question we have is from

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,160
jay he asks in your personal vision do

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,559
you think we'll move to a more

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,680
transparent open source like world in

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,839
the tech space

00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,079
if so why and what will that world look

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,800
like

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,319
you know uh so this is this is a great

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,839
question

00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,599
and you know it's it's actually

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,599
something that i'm you know uh

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,280
i'm passionate about and i'm working on

00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,200
you know within ibm

00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,200
uh ibm's been involved in open source

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,000
like i said since before it was cool

00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,079
uh you know back in the early 1990s and

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,920
um

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,319
and obviously we think that it's so cool

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,079
now that we spent 34 billion dollars on

00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,040
a company

00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:05,040
red hat um and uh that that's based

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,280
exclusively on open source

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,720
um i have a saying you know open source

00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,280
all the things

00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,800
um and you know some people laugh at me

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,319
sometimes you know because i think i'm

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,520
just kidding i'm not

00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:20,720
um i again i i tend to think

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,880
that um you know the value of something

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,000
isn't in the software itself it's not in

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,079
the code

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,480
it's in the support and services you're

00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,720
able to build around it and the

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,000
the things that you can do with it that

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,119
are much more valuable

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,400
than the software itself um and

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:42,319
and you know being able to sort of

00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,960
have you know and i'll take as an

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,280
example

00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,920
you know sort of kubernetes as an

00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,440
example there are like 4 000 people a

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,200
year that contribute to

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,440
kubernetes or some of the sort of

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,920
adjacent projects

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,000
that's insane there is no company on the

00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,200
planet that has 4 000 engineers working

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,440
on something um

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,040
and so there's innovation coming from

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,440
all walks of life

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,599
uh you know from every you know just

00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,200
about everywhere on the planet

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,920
um all bringing their you know either

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,960
their their experience in using it uh

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,630
and trying to help

00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,119
improve it uh over time um

00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:23,440
[Music]

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,880
and and so they're able to do things

00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,079
that i don't think even

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:32,079
google could have imagined um

00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,680
doing on their own and

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,079
i think more and more people are

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,119
starting to sort of get it that that's

00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:42,640
actually where we're going to innovate

00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,119
and so yeah i i tend to think that

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,760
um you know generally the trend is to

00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,359
more and more

00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,440
open source and less and less closed

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,359
source and that even

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,040
the proprietary offerings are starting

00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:56,880
to become a little bit

00:50:53,040 --> 00:51:00,160
less proprietary you know the

00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,680
secret sauce sprinkled in and and more

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,440
let's just deliver the open source

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,599
effectively and and

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,839
consistently and provide the best

00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,839
support and services we can for it

00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,160
okay great next question without open

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,480
source technologies like openstack

00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,240
kubernetes docker and ansible

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,680
properly integrated to make fog

00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,760
commuting possible

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,599
was this possible using proprietary

00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,079
software how do you see the future of

00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,440
fog

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:37,839
and cloud working together

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,839
so um

00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,319
so again i think when i think about

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,400
something like this it's really

00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,079
it's sort of the same message as the

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,040
hybrid cloud

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,319
message that you know ibm and red hat

00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,440
have been

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:56,400
uh harping on um

00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,040
there's there's no one cloud there is

00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,599
cloud

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,440
right which is really this fog of

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,200
different cloud providers

00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:08,720
and on-premises um

00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:11,839
deployments and ideally you shouldn't be

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,359
worrying necessarily about where it is

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,599
but we can integrate these things

00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:17,280
together i think that without open

00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,400
source we couldn't be

00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,280
pulling this off

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,839
again you know when i think back in my

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,240
career

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:28,240
to the early 2000s when we're doing web

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:32,000
services with microsoft

00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,480
um it would take us you know about a

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,160
year and a half to deliver a standard to

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,280
you know a specification that we could

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,319
both ratify

00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,920
not just ibm and and microsoft but you

00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,319
know the community generally

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,200
would ratify and agree on and then took

00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:50,079
another

00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:53,280
you know nine to 18 months to deliver

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,000
um uh capability based on that open

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,200
standard

00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,400
right um and so

00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,079
innovation was slowed um

00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,520
and what happened was the rest of the

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,200
world just sort of said well we can't

00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,359
wait for this we're moving on right and

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,680
they went down a different path

00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,839
um that was based on a lot of open

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,119
source capabilities and rest and so

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,079
forth

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,520
um and and so at the end of the day you

00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,040
know you have to look at that and say

00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,760
okay so

00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,200
did what microsoft and ibm do and and

00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,440
you know not just us but you know the

00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,079
other vendors out there at the time

00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,880
um did what was their mistake well their

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,400
mistake was

00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,599
being slow and and not sort of seeing

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,480
the fact that you know

00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,720
opening things up has actually enabled

00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,520
much more rapid innovation

00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,920
um and makes it easier to do those types

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,000
of integrations

00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,000
so you know again i i definitely think

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,400
that um

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,400
increasingly we're starting to see just

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,680
about every dimension of technology

00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:59,280
is being sort of uh uh

00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,280
is consumed by open source

00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,160
all right we have about four minutes

00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,000
left

00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,160
um so we could probably have time for

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,920
maybe two more questions

00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,920
i'm going to take this last one that i

00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,800
see about ibm professors to be

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,079
open source why haven't we opened up

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,680
risk and power

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:21,440
offerings um we actually did

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,359
open power is a thing it's been a thing

00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,640
for a while um

00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:29,920
and uh and so yeah the the power

00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,400
uh hardware and the power apis and so

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,520
forth

00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,720
are all open source um and we've been

00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,599
contributing to it and

00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,000
and it's being uh it's it's actually

00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,359
it's

00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,440
quite popular um and certainly in china

00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,640
it's popular we have google and various

00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,359
other vendors

00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,200
um participating and contributing to the

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:52,240
development of open power

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,799
um and so yeah we have now again

00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,760
um i keep working to try and open up

00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:58,079
more and more and more

00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,960
and i you know we're seeing that happen

00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,720
uh if you take a look out on the ibm

00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,119
organization on github i think we are

00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,319
approaching 2000

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,799
repositories under there um uh two years

00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,760
ago

00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,720
it was less than a thousand uh it was

00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,920
more like you know

00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:19,200
a hundred and four years ago it was

00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,079
it was crickets so you know increasingly

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,200
more and more

00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:25,200
capabilities that ibm once held as

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,720
proprietary are going out as open source

00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,880
and increasingly

00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,640
even the things that are fundamental to

00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,599
our future success things like quantum

00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,520
computing

00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,280
we've open source we open source the

00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,760
test kit

00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,520
sdk for the quantum computer and we've

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,119
also open sourced the

00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:46,640
the assembly language specification

00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:48,240
cosm and and there is probably going to

00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:51,200
be more um

00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,880
but it's not just that it's you know ai

00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,040
and machine learning models around

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:59,359
fairness and um and robustness

00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,839
um uh have been open sourced and

00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,839
contributed into the linux foundation so

00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:05,280
there's an awful lot that we open source

00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,559
now is everything open source

00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,960
no um but again increasingly more and

00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,920
more

00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,440
is and the pressure from the most senior

00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,400
management you know again if anybody

00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,000
gets open source

00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,640
it's arvind krishna who basically was

00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,559
the uh

00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,640
you know the powerhouse behind the the

00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:25,440
red hat acquisition and so

00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,240
um you know i think uh at the end at the

00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,319
end of the day

00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,839
you know we become more open with each

00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,839
passing day

00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,680
all right and time for maybe one more

00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,839
question

00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,760
i'm not going to comment on rumors

00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,839
they're threatened by it for enterprise

00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,760
i don't i don't see open source as

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:59,839
necessarily threatening enterprises

00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,839
unless they don't jump on the bandwagon

00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,480
i don't see it as a threat necessarily

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:10,480
okay great

00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,160
do you see any other here that you might

00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,640
be able to answer and are just last

00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,640
moments

00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,319
um

00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,880
can i comment on the alignment between

00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,799
the ibm and red hat open source offices

00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,640
we have a good relationship we don't you

00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:30,480
know um

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,680
you know ibm and red hat have this sort

00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,359
of

00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,359
wall between them we're trying to sort

00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,000
of remain somewhat independent of one

00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,960
another

00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,160
for a variety of business reasons uh but

00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,079
we do have

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,000
a very solid relationship with red hat

00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,400
in our upstream communities

00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,359
where we both participate and we do

00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,319
coordinate on

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:51,359
uh some things like uh you know who

00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,559
who's going to

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,400
you know take the lead in organization x

00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,079
increasingly many of the open source

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:02,319
foundations we participate in

00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:04,799
together um are uh you know putting in

00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:07,040
bylaws that say that only one of an

00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,040
affiliated set of companies can

00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,559
be represented on a board so obviously

00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,000
we have to do some coordination around

00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,640
something like that

00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,040
um but for the most part um you know

00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,559
again

00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:21,760
the we we try to uh

00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,240
uh you know remain engaged to you know

00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,160
to do

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,359
you know various alignment type things

00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,079
but we aren't

00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:28,799
like you know handing glove kind of you

00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,920
know

00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:37,839
marching to a single drummer um we each

00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:37,839
are going our uh on our own paths

00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:45,599
great thank you so much all right

00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,880
well it was my pleasure i hope everybody

00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,079
got something out of this

00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,040
and again feel free to hit me up on

00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,000

linkedin although i'm more responsive to

00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,119
twitter than i am on linkedin

00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,760

as a reminder this recording will be on

00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,760
the linux foundation youtube page later

00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,359
today

00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:21,119
