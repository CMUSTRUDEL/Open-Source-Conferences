uh thanks so much uh jenny if you can

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,680
move forward to the next screen uh

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,120
because i want to put this survey we're

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,840
talking about um a report and at first

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,599
before

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,400
we do that i like to put it in a larger

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,119
context uh the title of this whole

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,480
uh webinar today is actually amusingly

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,720
uh provocative

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
because we can also ask the question why

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,920
don't developers just always write

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,000
proprietary software that secure

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,439
and it's clear from the endless

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
vulnerability reports

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,040
endless updates that proprietary

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,120
developers haven't solved

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,800
the problem of how to develop perfectly

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,760
secure software either

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,320
um that said it's true that open source

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,200
software has some potential advantages

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,960
in developing uh secure software uh in

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,160
particular open source software can be

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,640
peer reviewed by many

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,840
mass peer review and that gives it a

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,320
potential advantage

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,120
and there is there are there is open

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,719
source software that's very secure but

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,800
unfortunately this potential is not

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,320
always realized and some has been saying

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,479
for a very long time that while

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,560
open source has potential security

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,920
advantages that doesn't automatically

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,479
make it

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,240
more secure or perfectly secure or

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,680
anything like that

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,960
and in that context back in 2014

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,040
the hartley vulnerability in openssl

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,320
i think suddenly raised this issue for a

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,320
lot of other people that

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,360
who finally started paying attention to

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600
wait a minute

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
we're using this all over the place some

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,079
of it's quite secure

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,320
some it's not what do we do about that

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,400
um and this really brought attention

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,119
need for increased security

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,560
in open source software um at that time

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,759
it led to the foundation of something

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
called the core infrastructure

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,240
initiative the cii

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,680
uh whose task was to fund and improve

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
critical elements of open source

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,399
software

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
including openssl it established

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,799
something called the cii best back

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,799
uh best practices badging program uh

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,680
which we may talk about later

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,119
uh two project censuses trying to figure

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,799
out well what are the most important

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,399
open source projects

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,119
and what we're gonna be talking about

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,599
today is the 2020 foss contributor

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,920
survey

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,920
next

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,680
thank you more recently

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,520
uh this has also led to the this issue

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
has led to the foundation of something

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,440
called the open source security

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,920
foundation the open ssf

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,480
uh that was uh formally established

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,360
announced

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,519
on august three so that's quite recent

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,800
and this is a consolidation of many

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,440
different organizations

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,200
many different uh folks working together

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
to improve the security of open source

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
software

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,280
and so it brings in the core

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,959
infrastructure initiative the open

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,319
source security coalition

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
the joint open source software

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,000
initiative um

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,160
a couple of the members are listed there

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,640
this including github and google

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,720
and ibm and microsoft and red hat in

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,280
fact that's just a partial list

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,840
um this if you go to the open ssf

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,159
website you'll see a much longer list

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,040
lots of organizations are now involved

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,239
so hopefully that cont that gives you a

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,920
little bit of context

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,159
and now within that i'd like to

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,480
introduce frank uh frank nagle

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,680
who will be talking about the results

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,799
from the report that we're

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,799
uh discussing today frank great

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
thanks so much david so uh thanks again

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,920
thanks for providing us some context

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,560
here and as david mentioned this

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,400
this uh contributor survey that we ran

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,959
over the summer of 2020

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,159
uh was aimed at better understanding uh

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,640
the human side

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,239
of um open source and open source

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,519
security in particular

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,000
um jenny you can go to the next slide so

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,560
in particular um we wanted to understand

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,720
uh

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
a lot of things but one the main purpose

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,560
was to better understand

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,480
how why developers aren't writing uh

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
secure open source software from the get

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,519
go

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,640
uh and so we looked in particular at

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,760
three

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,640
areas so uh go ahead jenny the first is

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,879
motivations

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,879
uh the second is time allocation and the

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,920
third is incentives and so we felt that

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,480
these three

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,040
um together gave us a pretty good

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
picture

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,519
of what drives uh contributors to

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
contribute to open source

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,880
um but also why they may spend their

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
time on some

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,520
areas like new features or things like

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,440
that as opposed to other areas like

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
uh secure you know securing

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,120
vulnerabilities or even secure coding

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,320
practices from the beginning

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,560
um so when we um conducted the survey um

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,000
we'll we'll highlight some of the um the

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,560
results here today

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,600
um in particular focused on these three

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,520
areas but

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,120
if you look at the report itself you'll

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,000
see in the appendix

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
we asked a lot of uh detailed questions

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
that we

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,560
kind of couldn't highlight everything

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,560
here today um so do take a look at the

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,479
report and you'll see more in detail

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,520
uh next slide so in particular what we

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
looked at

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,840
to answer those questions was thinking

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,479
about um the demographics

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,360
of uh the contributors themselves uh

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,280
then also

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,039
you know their current activities in

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,120
free and open source software and

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,039
and how what projects they work on how

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,199
what they do and things like that

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,320
uh we also wanted to better understand

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,120
the role of

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,240
employers and companies in uh the open

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
source ecosystem

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,560
and so we asked questions about um their

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,440
employers and their

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
stances towards open source software uh

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,000
and then

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,680
we asked uh specifically about

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
motivations and why people

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,039
get involved in open source and why they

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,280
spend their time uh

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,880
doing what they do and then lastly we

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,199
asked about time allocation

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,320
uh to better understand how people think

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
about um

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,919
their uh the way that they spend their

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,080
time in open source

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,960
and so um there's the highlights in the

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,440
report but

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,320
um just to give everyone here a couple

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,080
of numbers

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,319
um we we sent uh this direct emails

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,880
inviting people to fill out the survey

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,280
to the um the contributors to the top

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,560
200 projects that we identified in our

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,240
our prior work

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,319
uh that we released a report back in

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,960
february so that was kind of a targeted

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,440
approach

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,639
but then we also had an open survey link

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,240
that anyone could

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,240
uh could fill out any open source

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,000
contributor and we tried to publicize

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,240
that as widely as possible through

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,319
various linux channels as weather as

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,759
well as other um you know general meet

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,800
tech media channels

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,840
uh and so that led us to end up with uh

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,360
just under 1200 responses um

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,120
that where people uh filled out at least

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,720
um some of them the demographic

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,400
information and at least some of the

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,479
other information we decided that since

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,880
the survey was fairly comprehensive

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,720
uh we didn't want to force everyone to

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,280
answer every single question

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,120
and so about half of those 1200 people

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,639
answered every single question

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,479
um but the full 1200 led to uh usable

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,240
insights and so you may see the the

00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,840
number of respondents kind of change

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,639
from question to question as we go

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,639
through this

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,720
uh and that's the reason why and what

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
was also nice uh about the way the

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,639
survey was structured

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,919
was that we uh asked people uh about

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,919
their specific and

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,919
their involvement in specific projects

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,000
so we asked people to identify

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,280
uh the five projects open source

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,599
projects that they most

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,840
um frequently contribute to in in any

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,720
way whether it be code commits or or

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,599
documentation or anything else um and so

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,240
that led to us

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,120
you know from these 1200 um survey

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,440
respondents

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,280
we had uh over 2 200 individual projects

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,039
identified by these respondents so

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,240
obviously some were working on the same

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,880
projects but

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759
more than 2 200 projects uh are

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,319
represented

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,440
in the the answers to these um to the to

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,080
the survey so

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,919
um obviously it's it's not you know a

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,680
completely representative survey

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,440
um but we do think we have some pretty

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,720
wide coverage here which is which is

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,199
good for our ability to

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
kind of generalize the results uh next

00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,840
slide

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,280
so uh before we dive in i just want to

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,319
cover a few definitions because we'll

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
use some of these

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,240
as we kind of slice and dice the results

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,039
of the report

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
first of all we asked people their level

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,120
of involvement

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,840
um to uh uh in a given open source

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
project

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,280
uh and we gave them essentially these

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,199
four choices so i'll let you

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,319
read that yourself um but the the four

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,400
choices were in

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
in order of kind of highest involvement

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,800
to lowest involvement

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,320
uh maintainers core participants

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,719
occasional participants

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,159
and then one-time participants and so

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,240
for each project that

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,599
um the respondents identified that they

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,839
worked on uh

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,080
they were contributed to we asked them

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,480
to also identify which level

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,399
of involvement they had for that project

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,640
uh and i will point out too that

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,480
uh most of the time we'll look at

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,160
results at the person level so at the

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,440
contributor level uh

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,040
and from there um uh obviously if

00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
somebody contributes to multiple

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,600
projects

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,440
it could be a maintainer for one project

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,080
and a one-time participant for another

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,839
project

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,519
if we're looking at people at kind of

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
the person level

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,680
will um default to the highest level of

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
involvement that they have on any

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,560
project so

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,320
um so for example if you know somebody's

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,680
a maintainer on one project and one time

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,519
participant in another

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,320
for most of the results that you'll see

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,760
they'll show up as a maintainer uh next

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,760
slide

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,360
and then the the last few definitions um

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,080
that we wanted to to highlight before we

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,920
dive in

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,440
um are the difference between paid and

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,920
unpaid contributor

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,360
so again multiple people contribute to

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,839
more than one project

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,160
and in many cases they're paid for their

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,959
contributions to one project or maybe

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,720
two projects

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,000
but they also work on other projects

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,640
that they're not paid for

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,320
so if you're paid for any work on on

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,959
open source on any of the projects you

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,519
work on

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,040
we consider you a paid contributor and

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
if you're paid for none of the the

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,160
projects that you work on

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
uh then we consider you an unpaid

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,200
contributor

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,880
um so with that let's let's dive

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,959
straight into the demographics right

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,880
um and so again i mentioned we had uh

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,079
1200 responses total

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,640
um but uh for the um

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,079
uh people that answered precisely what

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
projects and what levels they were

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,959
involved in

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,079
uh was a bit less and so for this we

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,720
we've broken out

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,279
um the demographics based on uh the

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,160
level of participation but also age

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,600
and uh gender um so gender obviously is

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,440
probably the first thing that pops off

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,480
the page here 93

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,720
of uh these respondents were were male

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
um i believe the full sample it was

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,800
about 91

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,880
that was male so this subset is slightly

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,720
higher um there's there's plenty of

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,160
studies out there that have looked into

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,519
uh gender involvement in uh open source

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,279
um certainly ours is is uh consistent

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,800
fairly consistent with other studies

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,040
that that they have shown

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,480
um and so obviously our our results are

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,880
heavily male skewed

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,000
um but that is uh for better or worse is

00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,600
is representative

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,519
of uh open source contribute

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
contributors and we've talked about

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,000
um actually some future research and

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,800
future work um digging deeper into why

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
that is and

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,240
better understanding how that can become

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,120
more representative

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,000
of all software developers in general

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,480
and so you can see

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,079
here again maintainers are are

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
overweighted and that's partially

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,560
because

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,160
if you're a maintainer on any project

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,600
you show up as a maintainer

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,880
um uh in this in this slide um and so

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
obviously there's you know there are

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,399
some younger folks uh there may be folks

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,720
contributing to open source under the

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,240
age of 18 but for uh legal reasons for

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,399
the survey we had to

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,519
uh only allow people that were over the

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,600
age of 18.

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,279
um we also have people on the high end

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,839
uh um obviously fewer

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,800
um well into their 60s and 70s working

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,360
on open source but

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,480
again you know it's clear from um from

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,399
the results that the

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,920
at least the core of the respondents to

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,120
the survey um

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,600
were uh uh were more between the ages of

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,240
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,279
and say 55 and so we do have a good

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
distribution

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,760
um of folks that are our maintainers but

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,680
also people that are core

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,120
occasional and one-time developers as

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,519
well um and

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,240
uh yeah so that's that uh genuine next

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,920
slide great

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,920
um so yeah so the other main demographic

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,040
that we considered uh was of course

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,959
location um you'll see that uh a little

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,839
over a quarter of the respondents are

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,680
in the u.s um next would be germany with

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
12 percent france was seven percent in

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,399
the uk with five percent and then

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,519
a very long tale of um uh of other

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,720
countries as well

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,560
um so you know clearly um this is uh uh

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,880
a bit you know the the results will be a

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,519
bit more representative of the us and

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,680
and

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,560
western europe um but we do have you

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,680
know some uh

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,120
good insights into folks uh as well

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,440
from from other countries and other

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,040
geographies which is helpful

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,399
uh great so um the one thing you know i

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,000
meant i kind of teased this a little bit

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,519
already but we uh wanted to in

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,079
particular think about um

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,760
the the role of of money in open source

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,360
and how that relates to security and

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,160
sustainability of open source in the

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,839
long term

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,160
uh and what we found is that over half

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,279
of participants uh or sorry half of

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,680
respondents um

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,000
reported receiving payment for at least

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,000
um one project that they work on

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,560
either from directly from their employer

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,160
the their employ direct employer was

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,120
about 49 of respondents um or a third

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,880
party which was

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,639
uh about two to three percent of

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,079
respondents said that they received

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,519
payment from a third party for their

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,240
involvement in open source and of course

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,000
the other

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,279
uh 49-ish percent um did not receive any

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,560
sort of compensation

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,519
for a variety of reasons and so when we

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,839
think about um

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,720
this you know payment over uh the

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,760
countries

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,760
um go ahead uh to the next slide um

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,959
we we can see a little bit of a

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,760
difference in kind of the

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,079
the breakdown of of who's getting paid

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,079
uh

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,000
by country and so obviously you know

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,760
towards the end here there's a smaller

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,519
number of people and so it may not be

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,760
completely representative

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,600
but in the us for example of the people

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,760
that said they live in the us

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,199
and uh reported whether or not they were

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,199
paid for open source

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,120
about 64 percent of people said that

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,720
they were paid for at least some of

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,360
their work on open source

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,880
um germany pretty close to that uh uh

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,279
france a little bit lower but again

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
we're

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,320
kind of getting lower in the number of

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,480
responses here so

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,560
less easy to kind of generalize from

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,120
that um but we you know generally here

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,320
see

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,959
somewhere between 40 to 70 percent

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,040
of uh respondents from a given country

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,760
um being reporting that they're uh

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,320
being paid although less so in india and

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,839
china

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,360
uh but again those numbers start to get

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,720
a bit smaller and harder to

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,040
interpret um and so the other thing that

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,279
we've

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,199
uh asked about so this is this is the go

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,920
ahead um this is the one slide

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,199
that um where we looked at the project

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,760
level so as i said

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,360
um before we we you know lump people we

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,199
call people a maintainer if they're a

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,959
maintainer on any project

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
but here we wanted to break down and

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,040
think about um

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,000
her project are you what is the level of

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
your involvement

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,360
and are you paid or not for that

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,040
particular project

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,720
and so clearly you know when we look at

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,560
this um there is

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,199
you know this this kind of um clear uh

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,600
trends that the more involved you get uh

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,399
in

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
a given project the more likely uh you

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,839
are to be getting paid

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
for your work on that project whereas if

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,920
you're just a one-time

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,399
contributor down at the uh at the end um

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,560
you

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,160
you know that's it's kind of 50 50. uh

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,839
and so when we think about you know the

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,639
people and the projects that they're

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,800
working on

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,920
um obviously we have some of the higher

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,320
level uh

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,519
contributors um in this survey which i

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,199
think gives us a lot

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,560
more detailed information because one of

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,079
the things that we're um

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,160
in particular kind of thinking about is

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,839
how to get these folks that are the core

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,560
or maintainers of projects

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,199
um to really encourage all of their uh

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,839
team

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,839
uh to get more security conscious

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,320
and so um when we think about um you

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,800
know again thinking about kind of money

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,759
and the way that it is involved in the

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,360
whole system

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,440
we asked about people's employment

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,800
status and as mentioned we ran this

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,839
survey over the summer

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,839
um so in the midst but not the height of

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,480
of the covet 19 pandemic

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,399
um but the bulk of uh respondents said

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,600
that they were employed full time

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,120
uh and so a overwhelming majority are

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,360
employed full time

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,240
um and then the second most high highest

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,120
bar is

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,920
um the uh uh uh being self-employed or a

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,519
freelancer

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,199
um and so again you know when we think

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,199
about um the

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,880
people uh that are contributing to open

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,360
source in the old days it was

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,120
uh assumed it was kind of all um you

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,959
know college students or or

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,959
things like that um now we're seeing

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,560
this is much more heavily represented by

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,560
people that have full-time jobs

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,000
um and in particular you know with this

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,360
is makes make some sense

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
given the state of the world at the

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,720
moment um that the skills necessary to

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,959
contribute to open source

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,480
are actually super highly valued in in

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,360
the general job market

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,680
um and so um when we think about um you

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,400
know

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,600
uh the support for open source people

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,000
and we'll talk about this in

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,319
a moment when we look at motivations um

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,120
but most of them have a full-time job

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,679
that you know

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,439
allows them to um you know pay the rent

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,160
and put food on the table and so when we

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,319
think about

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,360
um what incentives and and how we can

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,760
change behavior

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,720
in open source is particularly related

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,360
to security

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,880
um we'll we'll come back to that uh that

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,600
notion

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,080
uh so the next thing we asked about um

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,480
was

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,520
how people's companies be given that so

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,520
many people are

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,240
full-time employed um how do their

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,360
employers ip policies relate to

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,880
uh contributing to foss on their own

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,960
free time right so this isn't

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,080
you know uh are you this is independent

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,000
of are you paid or not

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,840
um this is just does the company allow

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
you to contribute contribute to open

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,559
source

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,720
in your free time uh and we wanted to

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,600
try and get a sense of trends

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,679
over time and so we did ask people um

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,840
what is the case of your employer today

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,120
five years ago and 10 years ago

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,799
obviously um

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,559
as you if you look at the the legend

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,400
there um you see that the number of

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,000
respondents kind of dwindles over time

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,200
either because people didn't remember

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,200
back 10 years ago

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,559
or they weren't involved uh you know

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
there were in the labor market at that

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,520
point

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,880
uh and so what's clear here is you know

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,960
the highest bars there

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,080
um are are moving in a positive

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,840
direction right so

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,400
more and more companies are allowing

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,559
their employees um to contribute to open

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,559
source on their free time uh but what's

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,280
slightly concerning here the last two

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,720
bars

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
is that even though they're they're

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,799
going in a generally positive direction

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,080
there's still a large percentage of

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,919
people who uh

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,000
believe that their company either has a

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,919
very an unclear policy towards

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,760
open source or they don't actually know

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,360
what the open source policy is of their

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,120
company in the first place

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,039
uh and so we'll revisit that towards the

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,720
end so generally this is a you know a

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,400
good trend that we're seeing overall

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,480
but those last two columns are a little

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,520
bit concerning uh in terms of

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,320
employee awareness and clarity of uh the

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,160
company's policies

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,240
so then next i mentioned we asked about

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,280
motivation so what you'll see here

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,280
um is a list from uh of 10

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,120
motivations that are often considered

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,880
they're the primary reasons that people

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,080
contribute to open source

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,919
uh and so um when we looked at uh

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,760
and so to prevent you know from survey

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,919
standpoint we showed these uh responses

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,039
in a random order to people so that they

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,799
weren't just inclined to

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,080
rate the first one number one and et

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,720
cetera et cetera

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,280
um and so what we found was that uh the

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,559
the most frequently rated number one

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,440
um uh uh reason uh was

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,080
um i enjoy learning and so uh when we

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,480
think about

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,200
why people um you know contribute to

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,200
open source

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,880
it's it's this i enjoy learning and then

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,679
the other two top reasons for

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
contributing

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,120
whether they use this piece of open

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,080
source and need a specific feature

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,679
or it'll uh contributing allows them to

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,600
scratch a creative

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,760
itch or they find it challenging or

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
enjoyable so these three highlighted in

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,600
green

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,400
um were the top three uh most frequently

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,080
in the top three of people's uh rankings

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
uh and what's interesting is that none

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,720
of these

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,480
are uh on their face at least none of

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,120
these are monetary right and so

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,080
um when we think about uh uh the

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,760
motivations

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,360
uh and especially when we wanna try and

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,159
tweak people to spend more time on

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,960
security

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,480
uh it turns out that at least in in our

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,120
respondents in this survey

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,679
uh monetary uh incentives may not be the

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,919
way

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,039
uh and indeed if we look at the bottom

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,200
three um

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,320
uh motivations so these are the three

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,480
motivations that

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,600
showed up most frequently at the bottom

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,520
of people's lists

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,120
uh the most frequent at the very bottom

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,280
was i'm paid to develop

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,039
open source uh the next was that i think

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,280
this will help my career

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,320
uh and then uh valuing the recognition

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,400
of my peers

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,480
and actually when we when we looked at

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,200
um the subset of people that

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,799
said they were paid to develop uh open

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,559
source so you know this is this is

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,799
all people um the way that we have it

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,880
here um but then when we

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,720
looked at the subset of people that said

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,440
that they are paid for at least some of

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,000
their work on

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,960
open source um even those folks said

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
that payment

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,000
uh i believe was the the eighth um most

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,280
at least likely to show up so it wasn't

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,280
quite at the bottom

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,200
but it was pretty darn close and so even

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,159
for the folks that are paid to develop

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,960
open source

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,640
uh that payment is not necessarily uh

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,360
one of their primary motivators for

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,360
their involvement in open source

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,480
so the next thing um i mentioned that we

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,720
thought a lot about was

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,760
time allocation and how do people spend

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,960
their time

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,400
uh on open source and uh so we asked

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,280
people you know you can read the report

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,280
and see

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,280
some numbers around how much how much

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,280
time per week people spend on

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,400
uh open source but what we wanted to

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,280
highlight here

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,200
uh today was how people would like to

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,440
spend their time on open source

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,520
versus how they actually do spend their

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,360
time uh and so you can see

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,039
you know that the dark blue line is uh

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,640
uh is the ideal

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,240
percentage of their time that they would

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,919
like to spend so you know if you spend

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,080
10 hours on open source

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,919
um ideally you on average people would

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,799
like to spend around 34

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,200
of that time um working on new code but

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,120
in reality uh they actually spend less

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,679
than 25 percent of their time on new

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,600
code

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,960
and so we can see you know where we end

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,360
up um

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,960
getting uh people spending more time in

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,679
reality than what they would have the

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,840
ideal

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,159
is kind of in the middle so maintaining

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,039
projects and managing bug reports

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
um and uh administrative activities and

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,320
so in the report we

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,840
we break this out um by the maintainers

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,039
and the core contributors so those high

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,200
level contributors

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,480
um and there this is even more skewed

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,080
for them that they're spending a lot

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,520
more time than they would like

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,280
uh on these kind of maintenance and

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,640
administrative tasks

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,080
uh and then the last thing i want to

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,520
point out here this particular relevant

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,080
to our discussion today

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,720
uh is all the way at the end there um

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,640
and so

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,000
uh the security uh is is a very small

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,880
percentage of

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,400
people's time both in uh reality and

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,360
what how would they actually want to

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,200
spend their time

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
uh and so this is you know particularly

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,640
concerning when we think about as david

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,320
mentioned at the beginning

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,440
uh bugs like uh uh uh

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,000
uh hartley sorry had a brain

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,960
uh there so um heartbleed uh you know

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,679
thinking about

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,280
um uh bugs like that um this is a little

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,760
bit concerning because we would like to

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,880
see

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,559
um more time spent on security and and

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,159
perhaps even we'd like to see people

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,559
have a higher level of interest

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,400
in spending more time on security but

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,280
that's obviously not what we're seeing

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
here

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,720
which is concerning and we'll talk about

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,880
that as we think about

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,440
next steps and moving forward in our

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,760
suggestions

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,880
great um and so when we we were thinking

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,320
about um

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,840
crafting this survey one of the

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,279
particular things that we wanted to

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,720
better understand

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,240
was how do people um that are working on

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,640
you know open source projects

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,640
what types of help are they looking for

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,240
uh and so we asked them um

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,720
to to say um which of these uh eight or

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,600
nine

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,159
uh um options are the things that would

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,960
uh

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,279
most benefit the project that you work

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,679
on

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,159
that needs the most assistance uh and

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,279
overwhelmingly the the highest here uh

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,279
was bugs bug and security fixes um

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,960
obviously you know new features and

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,679
financial help and some other things

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,679
uh uh come along the line as well um but

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,159
bug and security fixes were super high

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,400
so

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,640
so what this tells us combined with um

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,799
you know the prior results is that

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,720
uh people know that bug and security

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,520
fixes are very important and

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,279
and and they need to be addressed uh but

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,400
they don't want to spend their own time

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,320
working on that

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,440
uh and and that's even you know when we

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,200
consider that

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,200
we asked about people's security

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,919
training and and their

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,720
development training um 40 of people

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,320
said that they had

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,320
formal training and secure software

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,120
development uh at a different point in

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,799
the survey

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,919
um but even they uh even they are still

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,279
requesting this external help um on bug

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,880
and security fixes

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,880
and um you know in the middle there you

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,480
can also see security audits and and

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,039
obviously we kind of overweighted the

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,279
help

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,799
uh requested or we got more detailed

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,400
when we were thinking about

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,000
the security aspects because that's what

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,760
we wanted in particular

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,279
uh and so you know the fact that these

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,480
um options were

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,559
shown up here um helps us kind of guide

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,520
um what we're thinking about in terms of

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,320
next steps and

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,559
and how we can help we as the community

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,880
of

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,919
of open source uh enthusiasts or open

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,919
source users

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,120
uh can help the contributors and

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,480
maintainers of

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,919
uh the of the projects that we use

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,240
um so uh in aggregate uh in the survey

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,240
in the the report um you can see it in

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,880
more more detail but we came up with

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,919
four

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,400
um suggested actions around kind of our

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,440
main

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,240
high-level findings uh so the first

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,520
was related to um this employment uh

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,520
employed full-time and

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,640
and also related to those incentives

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,240
that i mentioned i'm sorry the

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,520
motivations that i mentioned

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,720
um so you know 75 of its respondents are

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,279
employed full-time

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,039
and most people even the ones that uh

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,679
that's that are paid for their work on

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,480
open source say that that that uh

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,440
payment

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,520
is not uh a primary motivator of why

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,279
they're involved in open source

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,880
and so this is important when you know

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,200
when we think about wanting to tweak

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,880
behavior or or uh nudge people

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,320
towards in this case spending more time

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,120
on on security

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,600
um we have to recognize that um that

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,640
this is

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,400
this is not that money may not solve uh

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,080
the problem in this case right

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,600
in some cases certainly there are some

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,039
projects that are underfunded there are

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,919
some contributors that

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,720
would like to be paid for for their work

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,600
um and that

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,159
may be an option to to lead them towards

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,360
spending more time on security um

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,600
but it turns out um that actually uh

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,400
the um you know that that may not be one

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
of the primary

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,240
ways to incentivize people to spend more

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,720
time on secure security

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,600
uh and so what what needs to be done in

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,159
that case

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,600
uh is potentially give external support

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,000
more directly for

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,440
um security so for example um when

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,640
people request you know talked about

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,799
financial support

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,960
uh they were interested in have external

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,799
people do security audits so that

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,640
the contributors can keep doing what

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,320
they do and working on the code and

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,200
contributing new features and doing the

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,120
maintenance

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,039
um but actually uh that's uh the

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,720
what they need to do um you know what

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,919
they need for security purposes

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,159
um is external uh audits um

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,880
and so the next thing uh that we looked

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,880
at um

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,640
uh the next thing that we looked at was

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,760
also um that notion of people

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,000
not wanting to spend not wanting to and

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,159
not

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,039
actually spending time on security right

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,360
so um

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,559
2.8 percent on average of their time was

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,360
spent on security

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,159
um and you know for from our perspective

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,960
this needs to

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,000
uh increase um and so in addition to

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,919
funding those security

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,360
audits for in particular the critical

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,960
foss projects um

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,720
like those that we identified in our

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,880
prior report um but and

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,559
others that um have done similar kind of

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,279
prioritization types of work

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,799
um but also thinking about um how do we

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,960
address this from the ground up

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,000
so obviously security audits and

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,440
external you know

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,880
uh security work helps uh address the

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,799
bugs that have been

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,200
already introduced to open source

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,279
projects um but how do we actually

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,120
prevent those from the few in the future

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,440
um and so one of the ways is to really

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,240
help

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,880
prioritizing uh the secure software

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,880
development

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,960
and and the secure software development

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,320
life cycle uh and the best practices

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,720
associated with those

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,039
um and so when we think about you know

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,600
the the role of companies and employers

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,080
here

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,120
um they they have an opportunity to to

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,279
require their

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,720
developers to actually take some

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,200
training along those lines so as

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,679
mentioned

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,600
only 40 percent of respondents had any

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,480
sort of uh secure software development

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,320
life cycle

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,159
um it was slightly higher for the the

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,039
paid uh contributors

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,360
um but still room for introducing more

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,919
um

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,559
in terms of incentives um for the paid

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,039
people

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,960
uh to actually take training classes

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,000
related to uh secure software

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,799
development

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,720
and then also um when thinking about um

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,360
the platforms that are hosting open

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,240
source so

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,760
github git lab et cetera et cetera um

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,640
there may be operation or there are

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,559
opportunities

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,919
to actually incorporate security tools

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,960
and automate automatic

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,159
testing directly into uh the development

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,520
pipeline and so

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,919
um that was one of the other

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,640
recommendations that we had um for again

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,000
kind of

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,360
when we think about open source we're

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,480
trying to think about the entire

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,799
ecosystem

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,399
um not just what can any one project do

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,640
themselves

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,520
so the next um when we're thinking about

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,440
um you know

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,159
this this payment and the potential for

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,399
um you know using that as a lever to to

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,080
encourage people to um spend more of

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,200
their time on security

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,919
um when we think about um you know the

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,919
the um this this change over time

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,919
because you know in the old days

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,440
um very few people were paid for their

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,640
involvement in open source and now it's

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,799
much much higher

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,919
um so these companies that are paying

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,520
their developers

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,120
um have the opportunities to actually um

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,200
change the way that their developers are

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,159
spending their time um and so one of the

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,399
pieces you know

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,440
that i think is is important related to

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,240
this employer

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,600
um you know uh involvement is that there

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,360
might be fears that uh

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,880
large companies in particular but even

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,440
smaller companies are

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,520
pushing open source in uh directions

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,080
that are either you know not necessarily

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,200
good for

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,679
for the community um or are overly good

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,240
for

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,960
uh the company itself and so when we

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,360
think about

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,559
um you know uh the company involvement

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,880
that has been increasing

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,360
over time um we argue that there should

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,320
be ever more transparency

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,159
um related to this involvement and also

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,640
clear commitments because when we think

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,559
about

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,640
you know some companies that are super

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,360
heavily involved in driving a particular

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,600
project

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,120
um others who may end up using that

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,039
project want to know that there's going

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,600
to be continued commitments to it over

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,600
the time

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,720
over time and so um increased

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,880
transparency and

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,240
also clear commitments um we're not

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,200
talking about code commitments here or

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,039
code commits

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,120
we're talking about commitments to be

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,240
involved and help support these projects

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,960
in the future

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,320
uh and then lastly um we also think that

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,440
there's opportunity here for

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,840
for mentoring um and so when we think

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,559
about

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,440
um uh you know the the one-time people

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,240
or the the

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,519
you know occasional involvement um less

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,240
frequently are those people

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,519
actually paid um but they they could use

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,279
mentoring and so

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,799
this may be another way for companies

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,640
that are involved in open source to

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,880
contribute back to the community

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,919
not just through code uh but also

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,000
through mentoring

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,240
uh new volunteer contributors who are

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,559
not being paid for their involvement

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,360
and then lastly also thinking about um

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,559
allowing

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,799
foss projects to be transferred

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,000
uh the ownership to uh foundations with

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,399
neutral governance

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,080
um so that you know the the company no

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,840
longer owns the project

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,120
um even if they're supporting it quite

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,799
heavily

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,240
so then lastly our last high level

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,720
takeaway was

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,000
the finding that uh 17.5 percent of

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,159
respondents reported that

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,760
their employer had unclear open source

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,039
policies so i mentioned that before when

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,200
we were talking about that

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,880
um and so again despite this increasing

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,000
openness of companies toward

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,000
employee involvement in open source many

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,519
employees are are confused about what

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,480
their company's policies

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,720
actually are uh and so we encourage

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,840
companies to clarify their policies on

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,159
how and when

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,200
employees can contribute to open source

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,039
uh and also

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,200
actually promote this contribution to

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,880
open source uh because some of our

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,880
um other research has shown that this

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,960
can actually be quite beneficial for the

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,519
companies and their productivity

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,640
and in particular though um we would

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,399
encourage them to

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,240
uh encourage their employees to help

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,480
focus on security issues

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,480
um because these aren't the things that

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,320
the free contributors want to focus on

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,360
or the un sorry the unpaid contributors

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,720
want to focus on

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,120
uh and so the companies have an

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,159
opportunity here to encourage

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,840
their employees to actually focus on

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,120
security

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,919
so with that um i will go ahead and

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,080
we'll open it up for question and answer

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,120
i'll introduce a few other folks that

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,760
were in uh

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,799
heavily involved in the report um so you

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,640
already heard from

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,399
uh david wheeler who's the director of

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,679
open source supply chain security at the

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,919
linux foundation

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,159
um the other co-authors on the report

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,279
were hilah lifshitz assaf who's an

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,279
associate professor

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,640
harvard

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,320
also involved in the report was hayley

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,919
hamm who's a data scientist

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,159
at the laboratory for innovation science

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,519
at harvard and jenny hoffman who's the

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,240

management

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,919
at the laboratory for innovation science

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,720
at harvard uh we have two additional

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,240
folks

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,880
with us from the linux side who are

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,800
integral to the effort um

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,639
that's uh mike dolan who's the senior

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,480
vice president and general manager of

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,159

linux foundation

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,040
um so thanks everyone for for all your

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,040
hard work on the report itself

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,079
um feel free to turn your cameras on and

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,839
uh so everybody can see

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,200
you see your faces and see the the

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,760
people behind this uh

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,520
uh volumnous report uh i know the team

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,560
has been answering some questions

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,639
um because uh um

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,000
as people rolled in um but i think we

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,119
can kind of open up

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,280
um the q a um and so uh

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,879
let's see um jenny or david who's been

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,720
keeping an eye on the questions

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,839
um do we have any open questions that we

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,839
haven't answered yet

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,879
um we do we do um we actually they're

00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:00,079
just a a as a kind of a

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,680
housekeeping issue uh hugo asked if we

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,240
can share the slides we're happy to do

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,280
so

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,880
so we'll we'll happily do that

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,960
um and then there was a question

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,920
if there's any data of contribution of

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,680
students

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,400
like students doing intern like an

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,160
internship or a part-time job

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,280
to improve skill contributions and so we

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,880
we did look at

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,800
we did look at the cross-section of

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,200
people at different employment statuses

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,200
so it's a little hard to parse out if

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,960
someone has an internship

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,000
while they're a full-time student so we

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,320
gave people a select one

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,960
out of employed full-time employed

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,760
part-time full-time student

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,160
temporary worker we didn't specifically

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,280
ask

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,359
for uh the internship question um

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,440
but that is is something that we could

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:58,079
look into for our next iteration of that

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,560
lines two we do um in the report we

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,280
mentioned

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,280
that um those types you know students

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,040
participating in google summer of code

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,760
or other projects like that

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,839
um are a great way to to encourage

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,960
people to get involved in open source

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,400
from an early

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,040
stage um but to to make sure that

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,000
um security is being uh baked into kind

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,200
of the way that

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,359
uh those projects are are being um uh

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,720
you know are being contributed to um

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,079
kate i know you've been a little bit

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,599
involved in some of those efforts did

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,400
you want to add anything to that

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,520
sort of stick you on the spot there no

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,880
there's um

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,320
multiple programs and um

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,560
that people are participating in

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,520
between the outreach ones as well as

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,200
google summer code and

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,640
the linux foundation has bridge

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,640
mentorship programs and

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,240
all of these do tend to be good channels

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,240
for people to get engaged in open source

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,359
and then start to continue to contribute

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,560
so getting them working and engaging and

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,839
realizing it's not quite so scary is uh

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,320
you know a really good way of pulling

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,320
people in

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,320
great um excellent and uh uh

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,520
and david i don't know if you wanted to

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,760
also mention

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,359
a little more about the open ssf and the

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,520
the role that they're playing

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,480
um in kind of you know one of the the

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,920
things that um

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,720
we can quite highlight in the report

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,160
here but a lot of the the solutions to

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,480
you know kind of the problems that are

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,800
identified um require

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,520
a multi-organization um level of

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,920
involvement

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,520
and so i think that um when we when we

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,720
think about the open ssf which just

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,400
launched this summer

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,000
um i'm curious if we wanted to just

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,200
comment a little bit more about the work

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,359
that they're doing and how

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,800
um you know as he pointed out at the

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,920
beginning there's a lot of companies

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,839
that are involved in this

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,440
and it's it's an open group that others

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,520
are welcome to get involved in

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,119
um so david you want to just mention um

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,640
how people can get more involved in that

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:54,560
if they'd like to

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:58,400
david jerome mute uh yes the standard

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,400
phrase for 2020 you're on mute

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,520
so um so if you're interested in open

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,200
source software and security i would

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,200
urge you to check out the

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,480
open source security foundation the open

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,359
ssf

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,760
uh so you know that's at https colon

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,119
slash

00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,920
openssf.org i mean

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,599
simple straightforward urls you can get

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,839
and overall their tagline is

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,200
collaborating to secure the open source

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,440
ecosystem

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,960
uh the last number i saw they've got 35

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,520
organizations in fact i know they have

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,599
more now they've just recently joined

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,280
um i think that's that tagline by the

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,160
way though is a good summary of what the

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,800
open ssf

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,760
is all about uh currently has six

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,440
working groups

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,800
i'm going to read out just the names

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,480
because i'm hoping that some people who

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,480
are listening this webinar

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,160
watching it uh will say oh man i'm

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,000
interested in that and so

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,200
let me just read that out security best

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,960
practices

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,560
identifying security threats to open

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,960
source projects and that's particularly

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,440
focusing on metrics

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,200
securing critical projects digital

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,359
identity at a station

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,480
vulnerability disclosures security

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,320
tooling

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,480
um and they you know and of course they

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,839
may form new working groups as they

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,680
choose to do so so

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,960
if you're interest if you're interested

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,000
in open source

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,240
software and security that that the

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,760
intersection i would certainly urge

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,280
anyone to

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,280
you know check out the open ssf

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,680
and i'd like to go back to another

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,599
question that was asked earlier on

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,520
related to contributors receiving

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,960
payment by contributor status per

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,960
project

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,720
and so i'm going to go ahead and share a

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,880
screen this was submitted by

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,720
and forgive me it's either jen or yan

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,839
there's no pronunciation next to it so

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,960
forgive us

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,200
but i'm going to go ahead and share a

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,800
screen and then pass this over to haley

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,680
um and let me go ahead and show that

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,200
screen now

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,320
and let me know if it's

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,400
uh if it's visible for everyone great

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,760
thanks for this question oh thank you

00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,960
jenny so yeah thanks for this question

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,400
because it helped me realize that i had

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,520
the wrong y-axis there

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,920
so um each uh as

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,280
total all bars should add to 100 now

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,520
with this new y-axis

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,760
and so it's more looking at it as you

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,359
know 25-ish percent

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,720
of the projects are people who are

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,160
maintainers and they were paid for that

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,359
specific project is how you would read

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,760
it but thanks for pointing that out

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,560
because

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,839
it was not the correct y-axis yeah and

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,480
we'll make sure that's correct in the

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,119
report

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,680
uh yeah and uh what is the what's the

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,160
famous

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,240
you know quote it's with many eyes all

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,440
bugs are shallow all typos are shallow

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,599
so thank you very much and

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,040
and and we really appreciate that that

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,560
um this is part of

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,160
why we're we're presenting these things

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,640
we want to make sure that we're we're

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,040
getting

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,800
the right information out there um we

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,160
have another question about dependabot

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,680
which automates security and

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,160
vulnerability and so

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,880
i know that in some of our questions we

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,960
discussed different tools different um

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,440
different uh security tools that people

00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,359
use

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,720
and dependable was something that came

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,920
up um

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,920
very often especially as in in people's

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,839
text responses

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,119
but i'm going to leave that to the other

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,160
panelists if there's any other

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,200
additional

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,839
um questions or any additional insights

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,160
that they had on that particular

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:23,359
piece david maybe he'd be the

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,560
you or kate maybe okay yeah hey i can

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,839
jump in here a little bit

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,119
um you know uh i i'm not

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,119
i've done a lot of studies over the

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,160
years about tools and security tools and

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,880
i'm not to believe that

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,240
one tool is the one true answer or even

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,839
one kind of tool

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,000
different kinds of tools help for

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:42,319
different purposes

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,359
the vast majority of software today is

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,400
mostly

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,280
reusing and combining other software

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,280
and so you need to make sure that those

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,520
that other software you're depending on

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,440
also known as your dependencies you know

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,760
they're up-to-date in particular if they

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,839
have

00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,040
a known vulnerability you need to

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,400
rapidly

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,800
become aware of that update so that you

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,880
can

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,319
keep your dependencies updated and so

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,599
dependabot

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:12,000
is just one of of uh several approaches

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,720
you know several kinds of tools where

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,480
they can

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,839
tell you how to tell you hey wait a

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,359
minute you've got a vulnerability

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:19,359
quickly update

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,040
uh and so you can get updated now that's

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,680
not the only tool you need in the

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,800
toolbox

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,400
kind of tool you need the toolbox i mean

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,920
you need to not only be warned about

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,079
vulnerable components but

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,079
generally you're rewriting custom code

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,760
any other tools to help you identify the

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,319
vulnerabilities in your custom code

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,920
because

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,440
those kinds of tools can only tell you

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,880
about publicly known vulnerabilities

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,280
so you know absolutely we need to use

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,560
tools that detect vulnerable known

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,079
vulnerabilities in our dependencies

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,920
we need more than that though we need

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,040
tools to help us detect vulnerabilities

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,280
in the custom code

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,680
we also need to prepare for example to

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,280
update and make changes so for example a

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,800
dependency tool that tells you about a

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,280
vulnerable component

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,880
doesn't help if your software if you

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,480
haven't developed your software to make

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,440
it easy to update so

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,480
using package managers having automated

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,520
test suites so

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,400
oh i need to update boom update tested

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,960
ship okay if you can't do that quickly

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,280
uh

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,359
you've got problems so you know

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,400
certainly we want people to use those

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,560
kinds of tools

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,880
but uh security is much bigger than just

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,240
using that kind of tool and also i'd add

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,800
in that it's also important that we have

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,200
the software

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,079
transparency so that we actually can

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,760
find

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,520
that these dependencies and things like

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,520
that are there for the tools so having

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,960
improving the dependency of the software

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,040
and having that automated

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,640
and having it so we can track this stuff

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,400
in an automated fashion is going to

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,400
improve the security of the ecosystem as

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,400
well

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,839
great um there's a there's a question

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,560
about um whether or not we ask

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,160
contributors

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,839
um if they're involved in monitoring

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,520
security attacks

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,280
and or just responding to security

00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,680
incidents uh so we did not

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,359
ask directly about um monitoring

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,319
security attacks we generally when we

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,520
were thinking about

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:07,119
um security was uh the vulnerabilities

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,280
in the code as opposed to people

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,319
using those uh vulnerabilities for

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,560
attacks

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,359
but that could be something that um we

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,200
look into

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,640
uh the next time we run this survey our

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,400
our goal is to

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,960
um you know run this survey on a yearly

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,720
basis and to tweak it as we go because

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,240
this was the first time we ran it so

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,680
um that may be something worth looking

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,680
into for uh the next time

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,000
and then there's another question about

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,599
which companies are supporting the

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,280
development of specific open source

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,160
projects uh mike did you want to

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,200
weigh in on that um yeah i can wait on

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,319
that so we didn't get into it

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,480
specifically we didn't ask

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,680
uh participants into the survey what

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,720
company do you work for

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,480
what percentage of your the code base is

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,680
being developed by your company relative

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,760
to others

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,880
however we do have other tools that are

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,040
available to

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,319
help understand that uh relative to

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,720
certain projects

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,760
um there are you know a number of tools

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,960
out there that will potentially help you

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,079
we use a tool at lfx.dev

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,240
so if you go to the lfx.dev website

00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,400
there's an insights tool and if you use

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,720
the insights tool you can look at

00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,839
most of the linux foundations uh hosted

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,920
projects and

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,839
take a look at who's contributing what

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,920
percentage of the code base under

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,240
whatever time frame you want to

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,800
so you can take a look there and peruse

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,800
through the linux foundation's projects

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,560
you know other foundations uh may have

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,319
similar types of tools i think openstack

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,079
had one for example

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:42,000
um and uh i'm forgetting uh i think uh

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,000
eclipse might be using petergia's tool

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,839
for being able to display some of those

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
results so

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,000
the the answers are probably out there

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,880
it's just a little bit harder to find

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,800
uh but we can find that mostly through

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,319
contribution history and

00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,200
being able to identify who was

00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:01,040
contributing from which organization

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,400
yeah and i'll say i'll add on top of

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,480
that um you know the

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,760
as many companies have started to become

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,760
much more transparent in

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,960
in their involvement in open source and

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,599
um and some of the

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,359
uh platforms are allowing that to even

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,839
go further and so for example

00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,440
um just to throw out an example if you

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,000
go to github.com

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,520
microsoft uh you can see all of the open

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,319
source projects that microsoft is

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,240
involved in

00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,000
um their which employees are

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,359
contributing to those projects et cetera

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,440
et cetera et cetera and so

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,680
um we you know at the end of the report

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,000
we do call for more transparency

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,160
um of of company involvement in open

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
source um but some companies are already

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,200
you know going down that path which is

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,800
great

00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,720
yeah and i think frank also the

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,079
financial you know intrinsic and

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,160
extrinsic motivation

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,119
you know responses also lead us to

00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,720
understand

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,240
for a lot of people they have jobs

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,400
they're employed in in

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,079
you know they're maybe using open source

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,680
as a way to get that job

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,440
or they're being paid because of their

00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,319
skills in a particular open source

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,119
project

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,960
whatever the reason they are financially

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,960
compensated in some way that

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,560
leaves them comfortable to also

00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,400
contribute to other open source projects

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,839
and do other things that they want to do

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,599
which i thought was an interesting

00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:15,839
finding from the reporter

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,359
uh let's see good so just going through

00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,920
down down through the questions

00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,200
um uh because there's a question is

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,640
there any insight in how the

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,640
contributors to open source approach

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,480
security in their workflow

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,319
um legal and licensing choice

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,599
architecture language and compiler

00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:33,839
yeah so um so we we have some questions

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,000
um they're they're more focused in the

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:39,119
appendix of the report the details

00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,160
um what tools people actually use for

00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,480
security so

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,839
uh what tools or processes people use

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,839
for security and so

00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,280
indeed it digs into some of the legal

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,160
and licensing choices

00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,280
um some compiler choices um some other

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,559
best practices

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,319
um even things like the the the linux

00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,000
core infrastructure initiative badging

00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,440
program we asked about that

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,359
um and so a lot of that's in the

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,440
appendix um and so i encourage

00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,400
uh the anonymous attendee that asked

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,559
that question

00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,760
um to uh take a look at the appendix of

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,400
the report in particular

00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,640
um because there's more uh detail on

00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,640
that

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:24,240
excellent um okay

00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,040
this is a perhaps a good a good final

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,440
question but

00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,440
um can each panel member take a stab at

00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,400
a short answer to the title question for

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,720
this meeting

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,240
uh why can't open source developers just

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,440
write secure code

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,920
um so uh why don't we

00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,640
in to wrap things up why don't we go

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,000
ahead and

00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,480
we can just go around robin um uh

00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,160
so i i can take a first step but i may

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,200
steal other people's answers but

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,920
um i do think that a lot of it has to do

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,240
with that

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,079
um motivations time allocation and

00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,280
incentives that we talked about

00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:01,359
um and so you know that they want to

00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,920
contribute they have a limited amount of

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:06,319
time and they'd rather spend that time

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,680
um on on things that they find

00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,079
interesting right and

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,359
uh on average um you know many of the

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,400
developers just don't find

00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:17,599
security uh that interesting or or

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,599
you know um kind of um yeah

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,440
interesting basically and i will uh say

00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,480
we we didn't put it in the slides but

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,359
um we did put a few quotes um uh uh

00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,119
about exactly that type of uh question

00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,160
in the report itself from people's

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,160
responses uh

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,359
in the open-ended portions of the survey

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,520
um one of which

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,400
uh comes to mind that uh somebody said

00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,359
that uh

00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,480
security is essentially a soul-wrenching

00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,079
uh

00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,680
uh you know necessity that they don't

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,160
want to spend any time on

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,680
another said that it's the domain of uh

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,839
lawyers and accountants

00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,960
um not you know uh not software

00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,680
developers which

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,040
i think you know that in itself um is is

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,640
a little bit concerning that that's the

00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,480
attitude folks have because

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,240
you know part of the development process

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,040
is ensuring that the code that you write

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,960
is secure

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,040
um but obviously that's not necessarily

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,640
the attitude that everyone takes

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,640
um i'm not sure if others want to jump

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,839
in on answering the title question as

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,800
well

00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:14,319
can do a jump in here um i think also we

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,720
need to be seeing more tooling

00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,160
showing up in the ci workflows such that

00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,000
developers are flagged

00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,359
right when they commit something if

00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,280
there's um it's potentially going to hit

00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,280
boundaries or things like that such that

00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,559
it adds another layer of eyes

00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,640
effectively

00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,680
in the practices when someone may not be

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,240
thinking of something right off the

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,559
front

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,559
that

00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,359
yeah so i if i can jump in i i think

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,680
it's a it's a

00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,800
it's a valid question with a complicated

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,200
answer um

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,000
and of course as i mentioned at the uh

00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,240
at the opening

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
it's not like the propriet folks who are

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,280
developing proprietary software have

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,280
solved this problem

00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,200
uh you know we we're constantly updating

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,319
software every month because of security

00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,480
vulnerabilities

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:59,440
and i constantly see vulnerability

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,680
reports on proprietary software so

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,280
um you know i think there's it's

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,839
complicated you know

00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,200
in some cases lack of incentives but i

00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,200
think and many folks

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,040
in many situations part of the problem

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,559
is there's other challenges

00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,599
like education lack and

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,800
difficulty in doing it um education

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:23,200
uh we're already working on that uh you

00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,839
mentioned the open ssf the open ssf just

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,359
released

00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:30,880
a set of three courses uh specifically

00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,200
on how to develop um uh secure software

00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,280
uh

00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,599
it's free it's actually not specific to

00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,880
open source but it does

00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,240
include open source uh discussions

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,559
because that's very important when

00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,920
developing software in the modern world

00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,760
um but i think i think as kate mentioned

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,119
just a moment ago a key part of this is

00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,839
going to be tools

00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,280
i i think it's fair to say that oh

00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,240
developers be it open source or

00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,240
proprietor

00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,160
are already feeling a little overwhelmed

00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,680
they're already having to do a whole lot

00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,400
of things already

00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,160
they don't want to add vast amounts of

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,280
additional time

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,240
to do things like security so what does

00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,760
that mean

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,400
well we're still going to need to have

00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,760
some education okay that's because

00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,000
things like dueling can't solve

00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,400
everything but

00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,400
with a little education and with

00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,359
different kinds of tools and brought to

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,680
bear

00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,720
uh i think we can make a difference

00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,440
things like

00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,520
you know getting into the ci pipeline uh

00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,079
tools to detect problems ahead of time

00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,280
tools to detect dependency issues

00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,599
changing our tools

00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,520
so that it's much more difficult to have

00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,520
a vulnerability in the first place

00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,280
there's been quite a lot of effort to

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,000
make it so that

00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,599
programming languages and libraries by

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,280
default will be

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,520
if you just use it the obvious way it

00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,040
will be secure in all too many

00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,000
situations the obvious way is the

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,839
insecure way

00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,079
and if you work really really really

00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,480
hard and never make a mistake you can

00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,520
make

00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:03,760
use it securely and that's not really

00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,440
desirable for anyone so i i think

00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,200
i don't think there's a simple single

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,160
answer which is why you need

00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,599
organizations like the open ssf and

00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,720
others too

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,559
you know folks working on s-bombs uh

00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,319
sorry uh software build materials and so

00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,800
on basically working together

00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,680
to uh to resolve this because it's not a

00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,520
look there's

00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,839
you do this one thing and it's all

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,839
solved

00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:30,960
others no just

00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,839
oh go ahead go ahead mike go ahead go

00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,680
ahead

00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,119
i was just going to say um i think you

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,400
can say the same things

00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:41,040
uh about you know why we know that diet

00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:44,240
and exercise helps keep us healthy and

00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,599
and and happy um but i don't know about

00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,680
you guys i'm still

00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,280
sitting on that couch and you know

00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,319
binging netflix so

00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:55,280
i think it is you know as we

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,160
create more nudges like we do for for

00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,040
social

00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,400
other social behaviors i think and a lot

00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,720
of what we

00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:08,160
try to suggest are these nudges these

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:11,280
behavioral nudges from um employers from

00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,920
projects themselves um from thought

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,960
leaders

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,800
in um in open source and that's what

00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,440
we're trying you know we're trying to do

00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,839
but just as just as it's something that

00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,599
we've

00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,200
we've always struggled with every new

00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,880
year's i think

00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,960
it's i think this is something that's

00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,160
going to be a sticky wicket for many

00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,319
years to come but

00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,920
it doesn't mean it's not worth um still

00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:35,119
kind of chipping away at every

00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,119
uh every chance we get

00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,720
yeah as david pointed out uh

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,960
the nudge book it's it's definitely

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,559
worth a read uh gila did you want to

00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,799
jump in yeah

00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,640
yes i wanted to say uh to adam what

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,240
david said on how the community thinks

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,720
about security and the quote that you

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,720
brought

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,640
is really important the fact that

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,599
someone does not think that security is

00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,240
part of what

00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,839
they need to do right so from my studies

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,400
of wikipedia which is different

00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,839
but has some similarities i think it is

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,400
important to think

00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:07,839
uh of this report as kind of saying look

00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,960
this is something we need we need to

00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,640
think differently about

00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,960
because so far it's not being taken care

00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,799
of so one way is to make the tools

00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,960
much easier and wikipedia they have

00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,839
invested a lot in making bots and things

00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,640
that will make it

00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,119
now it's it's unbelievable the how fast

00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,839
it is

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,319
compared to how it was a few years ago

00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,960
to

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:28,559
fix uh all kind of you know crazy stuff

00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,599
that used to happen in wikipedia and now

00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,119
hardly do

00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,960
if you think about wikipedia back in the

00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,000
day it wasn't reliable because of it so

00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,640
i don't think open source

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,359
has that threat that wikipedia had to

00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,200
deal with

00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,960
on the reliability but it is something

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,760
important that we need to think of

00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,839
and and not to take um something that is

00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,359
external to the community and its ethos

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,040
so i think it's something the community

00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,720
wants to think of this is important to

00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,040
us it is part of what we

00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,400
want to do and make better so what david

00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,119
is saying about the institution and how

00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,559
we should

00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,640
take part of it i think is something

00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,720
that we need to to think more

00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,079
also how do we make security part of

00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,599
what makes open source

00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,240
great and not just like something

00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,839
external more of um

00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,480
to learn from other communities that

00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:12,559
have done it great

00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,240
i will i will defer my time because i

00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,240
think the panels covered pretty much

00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,599
all the all the thoughts i had frank so

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,680
great

00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,720
all right um david i think we'll give

00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,440
you the final word

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:26,480
uh uh uh there were one or two things we

00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:29,280
wanted to make sure we mentioned

00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,280
you're still on mute

00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:33,839
i'm trying to be generous generous to

00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,799
others and not interfere

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,799
uh so anyway so um i would of course

00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:41,119
encourage people to look at the report

00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:43,040
uh i think we're gonna uh tweak that uh

00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,680
y-axis that we mentioned

00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,040
um but uh you know the reports raise

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,240
news questions we're hoping to do

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,880
another survey

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,240
um in next year so if you see that in

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,559
that when you see that announcement if

00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,160
you're a contributor please participate

00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,240
uh if you're interested in open source

00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:01,240
and security i would encourage you

00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,559
to get involved in the openssf

00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,640
openssf.org

00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,839
i mentioned the ci best practices badge

00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,440
if you're contributing to

00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:11,599
a open source project uh you know

00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,960
by all means work on that and i think

00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,040
the broader issue here

00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,319
is you know the world depends on open

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,000
source software

00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,680
so you know if you're interested in

00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,839
collaborating with uh

00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,280
the open ssf or anyone else we would

00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:26,799
