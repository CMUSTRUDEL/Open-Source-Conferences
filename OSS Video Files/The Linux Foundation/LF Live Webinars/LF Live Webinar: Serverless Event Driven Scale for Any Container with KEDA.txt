Publication date: 2021-01-14

Description: 
	Sponsored by Microsoft Azure

Event driven workloads are growing in popularity given trends around serverless computing and FaaS. However, event driven benefits donâ€™t have to be limited to a FaaS service like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. With KEDA you can bring event driven capabilities to *any* workload running in Kubernetes, to provide on demand compute and elastic scale. This webinar will discuss the benefits of event driven compute, how KEDA provides event driven scale, and discuss best practices and real world use cases for bringing event driven to every cluster.

This webinar is sponsored by Microsoft Azure and hosted by The Linux Foundation.
