	LF Live Webinar: Multiple Workloads and Protocols: One Software-Defined Solution

Sponsored by KIOXIA

Applications in cloud and hyperscale data centers change over time as new workloads start, increase, or decrease in activity. These applications have differing storage requirements to best accommodate the varied workloads. This leads to data centers procuring and managing an inventory of many different storage devices with varying performance profiles and protocols. This is a thankless, complicated, and error-prone task.

This webinar will:
Introduce and demonstrate a new way of unifying flash storage via an open source, software-defined, multi-protocol solution to better manage the requirements of multiple workloads and protocols.
Demonstrate how this new method will simplify the deployment of flash storage at hyperscale level, enhancing TCO while reducing inventory management headaches.
