Getting to AIO - achieving coverage across varied types of technology, from legacy to new environments

Many firms are moving to clouds and containers for scalability, reliability, and to save cost on short lived workloads. But what about the legacy elements of a large IT Estate? Firms need to know how to cover both the new, dynamic environments and the older more conventional estates. More importantly, how can we get visibility of both, together, in one place?

	00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,199
sure yeah thank you very much uh

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,120
definitely

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,359
definitely happy to be here happy to be

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,200
covering this very exciting topic

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,400
and have john with me as well so i'm

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,799
gabriel klandorf

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,480
i've been with itrs group for six years

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,520
been in technology

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,160
15 or so uh lead sales engineer for the

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,640
americas

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,160
you know looking at monitoring uh an it

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,760
for very large enterprises

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,599
you know some are thousands of servers

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,800
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,560
uh some very big uh enterprise estates

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,719
john you want to mention a little bit

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,840
about your background sure yeah i'm john

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,040
wagoman i am a

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,360
solutions architect here at itrs i'm

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,000
based out of omaha nebraska and i just

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,039
joined itrs group towards the end of

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
last year prior to this role i worked

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,879
within the payments

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
and financial services space in both

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,879
systems and

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,079
application engineering roles so the

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,520
trauma of late night triage sessions and

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,559
getting woken up by

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,920
false alerts it's all still very fresh

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,320
and i'm very much enjoying being able to

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,479
help

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,000
organizations minimize those situations

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,439
for their own people

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
yeah you were you're wearing the pager

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,200
you were really in the trenches for a

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,400
while there

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,680
so happy to have your perspective and

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,479
expertise with us all right i'm going to

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
switch to our slides here so just to

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,920
uh cover the topics we're going to go

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,880
through so first off just

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,960
what is in an enterprise estate what is

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
in these hybrid environments

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,479
what types of technology are out there

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,400
there's lots of different things what

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,840
are they let's just build a list

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,079
given that what types of tactics and

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,880
tools and data collection do we need

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,159
to build up a complete picture uh how

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,200
are we actually going to get visibility

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,640
into all these devices

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,119
into all these systems into all these

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,640
applications and pull that all together

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,840
and then that last thing is how do we

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,280
pull that all together how do we get

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
that single pane of glass

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,640
how can we get it all in one place or do

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
we use multiple tools

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
uh do we have them work together or can

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,920
we get it onto one screen

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,360
what do we do in that capacity and for

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,719
anyone who's catching this as a video or

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,920
whatever if you want to skip ahead to

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,040
one of these sections if it's more

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,800
interesting

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,200
go ahead so that's that's what we're

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,599
going to go through um no code today

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
but definitely a a buyer's guide and

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,840
kind of a

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,319
a wide lay of the land of what we need

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,599
to do to cover hybrid estates

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,080
so what comprises one of these

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,200
large enterprises uh what types of

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,599
things are out there and so

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,480
once upon a time right back in the days

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,920
of the dinosaurs

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,599
there were network devices there still

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,920
are uh and there were main mainframes

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,519
right uh so these are you know a bit

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,239
just a bit of antiquity but it still is

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,560
true today

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,680
large firms often still have these

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
kicking around

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,400
uh and we need to have visibility into

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,840
them so we need to we need to certainly

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,040
do the network stuff that probably many

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,519
people have at the forefront of their

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,800
minds

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,400
but mainframes are part of the picture

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
as well and we can't neglect some of the

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,280
legacy elements that are still out there

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,159
in these estates we move forward closer

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
to today

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,519
maybe in the 90s kind of dot-com era and

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,280
we have

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,120
you know off-the-shelf kind of physical

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,879
servers more

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,800
smaller size breaking down these

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,360
monoliths into more

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,360
commodity hardware with applications

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,560
than coming in right web servers

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,599
uh processing applications databases uh

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,840
different things like that

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,000
running on those physical boxes now we

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,440
add that into the estate

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,040
and we're just adding on and getting

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,400
closer and closer to today we bring in

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,120
virtualization

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,959
wanting to go down that next level of

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,760
granularity and modularity with the

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,959
hardware

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,879
not having to worry about plugging in

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
physical machines quite as much

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,440
abstracting that out having those

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,000
virtual virtual servers virtual hosts

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,360
so we bring that into the mix and people

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,720
will run these things in parallel some

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
firms you'll see we'll have mainframes

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,239
and physical

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,840
and vm all right next to each other so

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,360
we get to the cloud and we say okay well

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,040
i don't want to run those vms i'd like

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,959
to let someone else run them for me

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,480
i'm willing to to let you know delegate

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,560
that let them take that over

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,799
and more and more you know over the open

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,959
internet connectivity more iot

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,120
there's more devices out there uh

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,000
hardware out on the net potentially

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,159
so more and more of that outside of my

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
firewall outside of my estate

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,200
uh connectivity as part of the picture

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
here and this is where we really start

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,840
to get into the hybrid

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,680
element of things we've got vms in the

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,280
cloud but then we add in other things

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,759
right we've got containerization again

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,880
just

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,040
smaller and smaller uh by breaking down

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,479
physical servers to vms vms containers

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,919
aren't quite the same as vms but

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,919
similar they work similarly and they're

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,720
just that next level smaller more of

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,479
them

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
having those either in the cloud or

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,080
on-prem we can have container

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,639
environments and platforms on on-premise

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,160
as well

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,080
and then also if i'm i'm willing to

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,240
abstract things away using cloud

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,759
services so now i'm saying hey i'll use

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,240
that elastic block store

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,440
i'll use that rdbs that that cloud

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
database service

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,639
things where i don't have to worry about

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,440
how it's running the thing is just there

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,919
for me

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,800
in that topical kind of service uh

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,320
offering

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,840
so that's a piece of the picture now as

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,280
well we've got cloud services we've got

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,639
all these things just piling up this

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,720
bigger and bigger picture

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,160
and then lastly we moved to we brought

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,440
in containers it's not going to be long

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,479
with containers before we bring in

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,880
orchestration

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,479
right if we go to microservices we need

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,000
something to be able to manage them

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,919
we need something to be able to run them

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
all in concert keep everything

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,120
keep the trains running on time right

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
manage the cloud uh

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,240
container presence and clusters and

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,199
whatnot the on-prem ones whatever it

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
might be

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,880
it's another piece of the puzzle that we

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,720
need to bring in here so a lot of

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,160
different technologies really a

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,919
wide gamut of you know disparate things

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,320
we need to cover from physical stuff to

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,240
virtual stuff to logical stuff to

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,840
every different kind of technology

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,120
that's in that estate honestly looks a

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,960
little bit intimidating

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
uh so we're gonna go through what are

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
what you know what all do we need to

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,880
have and consider

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,479
to be able to cover this so given that

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
what are the data collection things we

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,840
need to do and john i'm definitely going

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,759
to rely on you heavily here but

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,440
let's take these just a layer at a time

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,280
and go through them kind of point by

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,400
points the first one network devices it

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,720
was true back when

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,759
and it's true today what options do we

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,039
have to cover

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,520
network stuff all right gabe so the base

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,919
of any infrastructure is going to be

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,560
these network devices and there just

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,199
aren't

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,319
a lot of options here for monitoring you

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,840
know first

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,639
is the big one snmp the author of snmp

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,960
mastery

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,560
michael w lucas referred to it as four

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,680
lies in one acronym

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
uh you love it or hate it or probably

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
more accurately

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,800
think it's okay or hate it it's what

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,039
we've been stuck with

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,160
for a really long time and what we can

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,280
expect to be using

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,919
for a long time going forward it's

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,360
probably one of the least standardized

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,840
standards out there

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,919
but it's a standard nonetheless and

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,599
virtually all devices supported to at

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,599
least some degree

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,880
the good news is that because it's so

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,120
ubiquitous

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,800
the options for monitoring it are

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
numerous and they're generally going to

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
be

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,560
mature additionally

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,479
some device vendors have created their

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,759
own command line interfaces

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,199
apis or protocols for monitoring

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,199
probably the biggest one out there that

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,120
we all know is cisco's netflow

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:18,240
but there's others you've got ipfix

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,240
flow from juniper hp has netstream

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,520
and there's numerous other ones and most

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
of the time

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,039
these all get better insight and are

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,280
easier to work with

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,520
than snmp but unless you choose devices

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,319
that are compatible with one another

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,599
you're looking at adding a lot of

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,199
complexity

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,880
and you know one thing to note here as

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,160
we go through these our

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,800
intention isn't to provide a

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,560
comprehensive list of every single way

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,680
to monitor certain devices but

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,759
just a handful of popular options

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,039
right building up you know what what

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
should be uh you know

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,360
talking points or considerations the

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,840
main kind of categories of things sure

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,440
so here it's basically get some basic

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,840
coverage with snmp

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,599
i can do that everywhere or i can get

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,599
possibly better visibility by going with

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,720
something proprietary but i have to do

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,000
the covering i have to do the

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,840
integration or i have to collect the

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,759
data from all the different vendor

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,520
uh protocols basically right okay

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,039
so let's add in those mainframes again

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,039
they're they're they're you know

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,160
a bit of a legacy item here but they are

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,000
still out there

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,080
yeah and mainframes they're still widely

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,080
sold and and used

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,759
um hopefully we're not talking about

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,800
monitoring the exact

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,240
same devices you know in a basement that

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,360
have been there for 30 years

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,760
but you know either either way new or

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,399
old

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,479
mainframes typically serve the purpose

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,039
of running mission critical high volume

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,599
tasks

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,680
very quickly so tasks like batch jobs

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,800
and transaction processing

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,120
and when it comes to monitoring

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,240
mainframes not much changes on the

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,560
hardware side

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,440
we will still usually have the snmp

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,480
option

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,360
along with some vendor specific options

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,959
what we've added now are applications

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,160
into the mix

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,200
and whether it's a commercial

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,040
application or something built in house

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,120
apis are a popular way to get

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,800
application specific metrics

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,120
databases usually come into play here

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,080
also so querying those can give

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,519
a lot of insight as can custom solution

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,680
or scripts

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,360
okay so keeping the hardware coverage we

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,480
have from the network devices the tools

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
and tactics we have there

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
and adding on logical monitoring and

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
kind of app monitoring for the first

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
time

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,480
right okay so if we break down the

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
monolith and we have physical servers

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,800
now

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,160
at a smaller size we bring in one of my

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,000
favorite things and i this is where i

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,320
get a bit biased i have a perspective

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,920
i like agents we bring in monitoring

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,160
agents and agents really

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,640
open up a lot of good visibility for us

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,399
and a lot of coverage options

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,680
yeah and you're right gabe agents are

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,279
the big one here

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,360
now while there are some agents that

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,839
will run on mainframes

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,959
they become an almost universal option

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,720
and we're talking about

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,720
running the major server operating

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,000
systems like linux windows

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,800
solaris aix whatever

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
whether monitoring a solution you know

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,320
whether a monitoring solution whether

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,880
it's

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,519
you know a brand new open source startup

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,680
or

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,560
a long-time well-established commercial

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,640
offering

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,560
you can expect them to have a metric

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,440
collection agent that's going to run on

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,480
these os's

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,640
you know beyond agents you know we also

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,480
get the options for some os specific

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,320
monitoring like wmi or

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,120
some non-agent alternatives like puppet

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,480
or ansible okay so getting that next

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
level of visibility

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
really good granular hardware data from

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,880
within the os knowing what the os thinks

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,320
it's

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,480
scheduling of the apps and how that's

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,279
running agents really give us that next

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,920
level of

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,600
the picture okay then we we switched to

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,200
virtual machines and we've kept

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,440
everything we had but added on this

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
extra layer here what what is going on

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,279
with these platform metrics

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,959
yeah so in the case of virtual machines

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,200
we now have a hypervisor

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,640
which is the operating system firmware

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,279
software that

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,200
actually manages those multiple servers

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,360
running on a single machine

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,399
these for monitoring will typically have

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,240
a standard api

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,920
or software suite that will give you

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
visibility into

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,000
how the overall resources are being

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,760
allocated as well as some of the

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,120
basic stats on the virtual machines

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,959
themselves

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
and while this might you know may

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,399
eliminate the need to collect

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,480
certain of those hardware metrics we're

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,120
almost always going to still need a

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
solution

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,399
from this list of application metric

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
options

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,440
whether it be an agent or otherwise

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,640
right

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,480
so we want visibility at the node level

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,839
what the what the metal hardware is

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,320
doing that the the

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,279
you know virtualization platform can see

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
but also

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,519
some stats from within the os and and

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,959
that application and logical visibility

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,040
as well and then marrying those two

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,160
together we need to have both in tandem

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,480
to really understand what's going on

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,200
okay so then we then we ship them off to

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
the cloud

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,600
and we've kept again all the same stuff

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,880
uh we've swapped out the hypervisor here

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,120
and we're focusing on

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,560
just cloud metrics what what is what is

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,720
the the change there

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,040
yeah so as we start moving these vms to

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,760
the cloud we don't have a lot of changes

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,880
except for that we don't have that local

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,440
hypervisor to

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,800
query anymore now we have to rely on our

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,920
cloud provider to give us that

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,600
information

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,600
and the major cloud providers tend to

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,160
give us a couple of options

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,279
either a free or low cost api that we

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,600
can query to get

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,959
basic machine information or more and

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,760
more we're seeing

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,760
paid solutions that will expand that api

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,440
and then also provide

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,040
some comprehensive monitoring where you

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,079
can get detailed dashboards

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,160
and alerting however

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,760
just like with our on-prem vms we're

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
still going to need an option to get

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,920
visibility

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,200
onto what's happening inside with other

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,600
applications

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,320
okay and this this is a place where you

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,639
know you'll see

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,399
firms uh trying to figure this out that

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,360
you want to use the cloud data that

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,760
they're giving you

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,440
and the provider is basically saying hey

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,440
that virtual machine is there

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,880
it's running that's all i can tell you

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,720
they don't know what the apps are what

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,480
it's supposed to be doing internally

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,320
so you want that agent within the cloud

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,000
vm to do the rest of the work

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,480
and you really do want to do both and

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,880
there's a bit of a footnote here in that

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,560
these machines tend to move a lot they

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,639
tend to be more dynamic so we probably

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,120
need to run our agents a bit differently

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,120
in some sort of self-announcing mode or

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,200
building them into our ci cd pipelines

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,920
or some way that the agents

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,079
can be savvy to the dynamic-ness of the

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,680
cloud to the dynamism of the cloud as

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,519
machines come online they automatically

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,040
have the agent built into the image they

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,800
automatically connect to the monitoring

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,279
platform and start broadcasting metrics

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,079
in

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,440
or something like that okay so we've got

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,240
cloud servers we're building up the

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,160
coverage here

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,760
and then we add in services and wow it

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,360
looks like a lot of things change here

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,760
john what what happened

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,199
yeah so uh up until now we've been

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,399
adding a lot of layers

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,839
that make monitoring more difficult but

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,600
now we're making it more difficult

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,079
because we're losing a lot of these

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,440
options

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,000
that we may have been relying on

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,320
previously we no longer have access to

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,920
the underlying hardware or even an os

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,600
so those options are just completely

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,920
gone we're

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,199
now left with whatever the cloud

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,120
provider gives us

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,639
and whatever options we've built into

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,079
our applications

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,839
however there's you know one thing we

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,680
didn't mention earlier and that's an

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,320
option for most things web-based

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,680
and that's synthetic monitoring this is

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,079
where we can send

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,120
external requests through our web app to

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,720
perform tasks

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,480
and let us monitor the user experience

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,160
right what do my users see what is it

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
like to be one of them definitely a

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,959
really

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,920
important way of testing things and

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,839
we've yeah

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,839
okay so we've abstracted away the

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,320
hardware i'm lazy i didn't want to run

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,160
it

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,600
so we've abstracted away the hardware we

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,279
lose visibility to it but we've still

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
got all that logical visibility that you

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,079
mentioned

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
all right and then we go to containers

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,600
and we still have given

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,040
up that hardware stuff but what else can

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,279
we do here what's different

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,639
when we go to containers yeah and we've

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,360
saved containers for last they're

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,360
difficult

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,800
to place in this list because they can't

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,320
exist both on

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,399
prem or in the cloud but just like with

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,440
cloud services our options are

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,120
pretty limited we can usually get basic

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
information on our containers from the

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,399
container platform

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
whether it be the docker cli or api for

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,240
our

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,800
on-prem installs or an api provided by

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
by our cloud provider or in some cases

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,639
we're using both

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,880
the challenge again here is getting

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,000
visibility inside of the container

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,079
so we're relying again on those api

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,680
calls database queries scripts or

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,639
synthetic solutions to

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,240
monitor your application health right so

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,279
again that same model of platform

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,880
metrics

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,199
asking the platform what's going on and

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,959
then doing some app logical stuff

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,480
in here sometimes we do in-app metrics

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,600
there's code injection things there's

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,120
statsd there's

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,959
different different you know we're kind

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,720
of repurposing our app options there's

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,320
lots of things that can be done here but

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,480
those are those are the main categories

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,959
probably looking at this this is a lot

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
john

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,759
this is pretty intimidating if there's

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,360
all these different things all these

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,360
different kind of plugins and tactics

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,440
and data capture methods we need

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,800
you know what what can we do to even

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,720
handle this

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,480
and i guess i'll i'll start us off a

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,920
little bit just to set a baseline of

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
what a monitoring platform

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,839
is but we really how can we get this all

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,480
in one place or can we get this all into

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,160
one place so at a very very

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,519
oversimplified level

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,680
a borrowing platform i'm just going to

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,040
give some basic basic building blocks

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,800
some basic parts here

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,000
there's collection there's some place

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,519
that we're fetching data right there

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
might be agents it might be other things

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,839
whatever it is some manner in which

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,440
we're gathering data together

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,959
it needs some processing it might need

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,279
to be indexed it might need to be you

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,600
know

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,600
alerted on and threshold and rules and

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,079
whatever but there's some processing of

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
it

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,600
it has to be saved somewhere it has to

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,560
be stored right we need we need some way

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,320
of saving it

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,160
and somewhere somehow some human is

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,079
going to see it right and so ui here is

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,240
a bit a bit open-ended it could be

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,160
slack messages it could be emails but

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,240
probably there's also an actual

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,039
web interface or or thick client

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,720
interface some ui to this platform

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,480
uh so so that's a basic monitoring

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,400
platform if we break it down that way

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,520
given what we've said so far all these

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,439
different bits of tech

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,640
you know techniques and data capture and

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,640
different types of collection

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,559
different methodologies my instinct

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,439
would be to say we're going to have many

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,079
of these

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,760
and this is just a dumb first guess to

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,640
say that you know maybe the physical

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,039
servers have one

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,000
platform the database stuff has its own

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,840
dedicated tool there's

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,080
a network tool that does you know

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,280
scanning and discovery and mapping

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,960
maybe i have something that's really

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,880
good for cloud presence or i use the

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,400
cloud data and that stands to the side

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,160
as its own source of data

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,480
and then i've got like some really

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,520
dynamic fast container visibility or

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
something

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,640
i could see having multiple tools to

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,480
cover this but is that

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
is that you know what does that get us

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,880
john is that what we want to do

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,320
yeah i i certainly see some upsides with

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,559
choosing multiple tools

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,360
we could pick the best in class solution

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,600
for

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,039
each part of our estate networking could

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,799
have their platform

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,960
and we don't have to worry if it's going

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,440
to work for the database or storage

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,160
teams because they can just go with

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,840
whatever works best for them and also

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,840
when you have multiple tools

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,120
if one of them goes down we're not

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
totally in the dark when it comes to

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,200
visibility

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,600
into our infrastructure right okay so a

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,400
little bit of failure isolation there

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,480
on the flip side i always worry and this

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
is a this is a particular focus you know

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,960
i

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,120
try to turn uh companies on to

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,240
operations operation ability kind of a

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,000
made-up term

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,440
um you could think of it as sre if

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,720
you're thinking of it that way

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,799
culture of monitoring if you want to

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,720
call it that basically how much

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,559
are we enabling our staff to do prod

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,160
support how much are we enabling our

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,120
staff to actually run ops

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,880
fix things detect issues work together

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,320
and a big piece of this if people are

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,760
living in different tools if they're

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,440
looking at different sets of

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,520
information there's a lot of finger

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,720
pointing a lot of disagreement

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,400
staff are you know they're not they're

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,480
not working off of the same data they're

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,559
not working off of the same reality so

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,600
it doesn't always lend itself to kind of

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,919
figuring out what's

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,559
wrong and moving forward very quickly

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,400
also lots of different uis to live in

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,240
staff workflows start to suffer a little

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,520
bit can people actually get from a to b

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,360
to z to whatever

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,440
to something quickly or are they

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,559
juggling between many different uis and

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,320
fetching data from

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,400
other places to do their job so a lot of

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,080
a lot of thinking around not necessarily

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,799
a deal breaker but just a lot of concern

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,720
around

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,799
how well are the staff actually going to

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,240
be able to do their jobs and navigate

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,320
through that that tool of set

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,400
also dollars if i've got many things i

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,160
gotta buy it just kind of adds up right

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,600
there's more money as i'm purchasing

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,679
you know one item versus four items

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,720
versus ten items the the amount that i'm

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,960
spending likely

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,000
uh builds up and even if i'm not buying

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,919
them even if it's a free

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
tool or prometheus or whatever might be

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,200
out there open source things

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,559
i still have to run them i still have to

00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
manage them and administer them and

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,799
maintain them

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,720
that's going to add up too there's a

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,480
cost of ownership implicit in that

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,320
uh the effort there and the cost of my

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,640
staff to run these platforms

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,080
so definitely some pros and cons having

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,200
discrete tools

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,679
the next obvious uh idea to me would be

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,320
if we pick one if we say all right this

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,520
is the guy

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,799
we're you know looking at many

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,000
monitoring different tools we're gonna

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,760
pick this

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,520
uh and everyone's going to want to use

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,039
that tool that platform

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,559
hopefully a pretty big one but we're all

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,400
going to converge to that

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,080
what does this get us john are there

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,440
pros there is that is that what you

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,400
would want to do

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,000
yeah yeah there's a lot of great options

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,520
or a lot of great things with

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,760
this option you know when there's an

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,559
issue everybody in

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,080
engineering operations and leadership

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,280
they're all going to be on the same page

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,159
looking at the same data in the same ui

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,640
it makes training easier setup easier

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,440
and

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,600
gives us a lot of consistency it would

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,520
also would be nice to

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,480
only have one vendor to rely on for

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,960
support and we don't have to worry about

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,240
any unsupported integrations we may have

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,440
had to build if we had

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,600
multiple tools and

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,360
speaking of integrations if we go with a

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,679
comprehensive solution

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,799
we can expect that it can cover just

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,720
about

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,799
everything we have to a reasonable

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,360
extent

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,360
right if this is an enterprise level

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,280
offering one assumes it's a pretty wide

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,720
ranging in its capabilities

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,159
sure on the flip side i can imagine

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,440
right you think you're a manager

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,200
uh you know trying to go through this

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
buying process and you've got 10

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,400
different audience members below you

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,679
and they're all clamoring for different

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,840
things they've all got different

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,000
constraints requirements wish list items

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,520
that rfp is getting longer and longer

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,280
it's going to be harder and harder to

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,880
find that one goldilocks

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,559
platform that's going to cover

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,919
everything perfectly

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,360
so it just becomes a harder search

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,960
longer search you know you have to do a

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,360
bit more due diligence and whatnot

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,120
to really try to fill out that full

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,080
requirements list

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,799
on the flip side or probably in in

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,720
conjunction

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,919
there will be compromises and because

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,600
it's going to be so hard to

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,679
exactly give everyone exactly what they

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,799
want probably going to have to make some

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,480
trade-offs

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,960
people get only 80 of what they want or

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,799
it's good enough in certain areas

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,240
so so definitely get to some really nice

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,880
things but there are costs to that

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,559
how do we pick a tool uh and and this is

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,559
true if it's multiple tools if it's one

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,559
tool in general what are we looking at

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,720
i think of that operation ability first

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,159
and foremost right the job of this

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,080
is to just be able to do production

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,480
support to be able to do it ops be able

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,320
to

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,840
keep the lights on make sure when stuff

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,159
is broken it's getting fixed quickly

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,360
we know that stuff is healthy or not and

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,840
exactly how much

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,679
um really having that that operational

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,440
mindset of are things working what's

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,159
broken are we fixing it

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
so that's first and foremost i think uh

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,559
but

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,159
certainly also integrations you know

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,600
what apis are supported what

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,280
integrations come out of the box

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,280
what protocols are supported to make it

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,640
easy to interface tools with each other

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,480
or to fetch data from some of our

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
bespoke apps or to fetch data from this

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,200
app that there isn't an out of the box

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,360
solution for

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,240
uh so being careful around integrations

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,799
what what

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,919
capabilities and options we have there

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,520
data residency

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,679
and this is becoming a bigger and bigger

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,760
topic as the cloud is more and more

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,080
prevalent as we're talking about hybrid

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,679
as we're talking about sas offerings

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,000
where does the data live

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,760
how much is there do i get granular you

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,120
know how granular is it do i get access

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,960
to full granularity

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,200
or is it aggregated when i go to

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,799
retrieve it um so if it lives within my

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,240
walls you know maybe i have to do a bit

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,280
of management around how much i'm

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,960
storing and

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,720
when we want to start to you know

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,039
aggregate the data down

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,080
versus if it's out in the world i don't

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,960
have to worry about

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,159
supporting the the actual data store i'm

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,400
running the hardware for it

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,600
but i don't have as much control over

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,600
what we're saving

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,919
uh so where it lives definitely a

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,960
question um and whether that matters to

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,279
a firm or not

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,440
also the data model we're talking about

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,960
different types of data collection

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,159
and the platform may or may not be able

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,520
to capture all of them you know

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,480
certainly metrics nearly everyone

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,960
everything can do that

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,840
metrics sure uh but but there even that

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,159
has questions

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,600
of if it's you know dynamic workloads if

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,200
it's containers that come and go is

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,159
there enough metadata for me to be able

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,720
to understand

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,559
how that workload you know relates to

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,520
the same workload two hours ago that

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,360
came and went

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,039
uh can i map things together is there

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,799
enough in the data model from a metadata

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,880
perspective to make sense of everything

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,640
not to mention what about logs does it

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,120
store logs some things don't

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,880
right uh what about traces does it store

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,600
traces a different kind of data to be

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,039
capturing

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,640
we want to make sure we have a place for

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,159
that and then

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,320
completely different network you know

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,919
topology graphs or maps

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,320
uh when i do a scan and i've got

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,320
dependency mapping and data flow mapping

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,240
that's a totally different type of data

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,760
to be capturing as well and then

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,520
everything else that's out there and

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,120
goes with all this so the data model

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
what we can save how well we can save it

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,279
how it represents it that's pretty

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,600
important

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,320
and then lastly the ui does it have

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,240
visuals

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,080
that are not just pretty they're not

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,480
just going to be eye-catching and

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,000
make our executives look uh you know get

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,320
excited to see them on a tv

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,080
but actually help people you know get

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,840
their that operations thing

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,520
help people make sense of the data be

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,520
able to visualize it well be able to use

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,200
it well be able to do their job well

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,039
hopefully interact with it hopefully

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,640
have custom views hopefully

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,400
you know maybe even make changes against

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,279
the underlying system

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,039
so ui that really enables you know gives

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,760
the user empowerment

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,880
uh and and is able to help them leverage

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,320
the data as much as just show it

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,559
all right so we've done many different

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,240
tools and we've picked one tool

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,240
i guess the next best thing i can think

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,480
of would be if we kind of picked one

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,039
tool if we kind of converge to one as

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,919
the main standard but we allowed for

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,400
others

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,159
to do you know some some side jobs

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,039
effectively maybe they have a specialty

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,880
in one area

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,400
and we fetch that stuff in and bring

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,640
that along for the ride

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,480
uh but we mostly have a primary and then

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,279
the others kind of work you know side

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,279
car or

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,039
alongside by some sort of integration

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,039
john does this make any sense to you

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,720
what does this do for us yeah so with

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,880
this one we get the option

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,840
to again choose best-in-class tools

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,120
um just like if we had the the disparate

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,840
tools of course with the

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,159
caveat that our chosen tool can export

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,200
to

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,000
our chosen data store whether that be a

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,600
time series database like influx or a

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,799
traditional database like mysql

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,440
but we get that nice modularity where we

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,640
can

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,159
insert remove or change our tools

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,320
a lot easier than if we just had the one

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,919
along with that we're not vendor trapped

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,039
which could potentially give us an upper

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,679
hand when it comes

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,039
time to negotiate or renegotiate

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,039
contracts

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,120
right right yeah definitely some good

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,640
points there tool modularity being able

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,640
to swap things in and out

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,400
having each one do their job really well

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,440
but then only using them for the part

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,360
that they're good at

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,960
specialization that all makes sense and

00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,919
you can visualize this very easily if

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,400
you had some

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,559
monitoring third-party platform uh and

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,039
then you had you know maybe prometheus

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,600
for

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,240
some collection some cloud data coming

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,799
in

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,320
uh maybe there's a log tool uh and it's

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,600
all being kind of merged together and

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,039
then maybe a couple different uis the

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,120
one that comes with the platform

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,240
maybe grafana and then maybe we do some

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,320
reports

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,080
uh or some data analysis fetching stuff

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,440
off the api or something or

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,520
you know something like that so i could

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,200
easily see exactly what you're saying

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,120
many different modular parts each

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,399
specialized to their area

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,760
that does imply a mixed technology set

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,279
uh and that can be that can be a

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,880
blessing like we just said but that can

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,480
that comes with a cost right i've got to

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,320
know all those different tools

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,600
i've got to install them administer them

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,799
manage them run them

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,200
i need to get them to integrate with

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,200
each other so there's a lot of my own

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,960
you know kind of diy roll up your

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,679
sleeves and elbow grease

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,360
to to get that all to work together well

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,080
and to keep that ship running

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,559
um you know in the way that you want we

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,720
also

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,320
did say we're converging to one data

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,760
model we're saying that this platform

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,720
we're all going to send all the data to

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,640
this database

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,600
uh whatever it might be right like you

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,799
mentioned influx there's different

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,720
things out there but we're going to

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,720
merge everything into that

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,480
that does imply a constraint that does

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,760
imply that if that data model doesn't

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,120
support certain types of data we're

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,159
going to lose it if i can't get those

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,559
traces in there

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,200
if it doesn't do logs uh if it doesn't

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,279
do

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,200
uh those network maps and topology

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,799
diagrams that's a challenge so we have

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,440
to really be careful about that data

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,799
model

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,919
it's gonna be a lot of due diligence and

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,960
scrutiny does it does it cover

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,240
everything we need it to

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,159
does it have enough metadata and

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,840
dynamicness for short-lived workloads

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,000
and containers and things

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,960
so we have to we kind of extra extra

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,480
scrutiness there

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,159
and the last thing is support that's

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,600
kind of implied up here because we've

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,880
got mixed technology bag we've got all

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,559
these different things out there

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,480
you know are they supported which ones

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,480
are supported who do i go to

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,399
you know where is it party a's

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,159
responsibility versus party b's

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,840
uh with that integration between two

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,320
parts you know there's a there's a lot

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,360
of

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,120
questions around that so we've said okay

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,279
multiple different you know tools

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,960
multiple collection one data store

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,559
the other option i guess i could think

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,559
of would be multiple

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,000
tools letting them save their data

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,600
however they want but then having

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,120
trying to bring them together in the ui

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,880
somehow trying to just merge it all into

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,440
one screen somehow

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,720
so pad just this is again maybe a

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,760
primary tool but definitely

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,320
a primary ui my apologies

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,840
uh getting a little click happy here uh

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,200
one primary ui

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,039
but then i have all these different

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,520
platforms they run exactly the way they

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,520
want

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,039
they can save the data the way they want

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,960
um so there's no loss

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,320
it's all being captured in its own

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,760
native kind of format

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,840
and then we try to bring it together

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,399
after the fact what are your thoughts on

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,720
this john does this look helpful yeah

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,600
again we get to pick the right tool for

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,000
the job

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,760
but we don't have to worry about whether

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,840
it can export to

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,840
you know that single chosen data store

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,120
like in the in the last option

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,240
uh we don't have to you'll risk that

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,080
data flattening or manipulating our data

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,279
just to make it conform

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,200
to a single data store because each tool

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,520
gets to write to its own

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,480
native location meaning that we have

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,159
access to

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,840
all of the data as the product

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,240
developers intended

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,840
you know and when it comes to the ui

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,559
there's really great options out there

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,320
that are able to pull and receive data

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,840
from a wide range of sources

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,840
of course the big one right now is

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,039
grafana you know and

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,279
say you have one tool that's writing to

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,399
influx another device sequel and then

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,880
another one

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,480
shooting out web hooks it's no problem

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,159
for a lot of these tools to

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,399
take that all in and give you a

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,760
standardized and consistent

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,000
single view of everything right

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,919
in a way looking at this we've kind of

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,720
taken our constraint on the data store

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,440
like you said

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,600
away by bumping it up a layer so now the

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,960
ui is beholden to be able to talk to all

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,320
these things and make sense of all these

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,399
disparate data models

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,919
the data hasn't been converged to one

00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,360
model it's it's different models and the

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,440
ui has to handle it

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,039
uh so that's just a you know it's it's

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,519
fine we're just moving the

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,240
constraint up a layer um which is which

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,240
is fine

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,600
that may imply compromises on the data

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,880
visualization

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,720
and what do we mean here you know

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,240
grafana does do logs but

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,960
probably not as well as a dedicated

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,640
blogging tool right that's just reality

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,640
of how this works if you've got

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,640
a tool that's really good at network

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,120
maps and and graphs and

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,399
diagrams maybe it's mediocre on metrics

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,240
maybe it's not so good on

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,600
log visibility it still is going to

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,440
shine in that one area so when you're

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,960
when you're going to that one ui

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,519
it may not be able to do all things

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,279
perfectly and and there is a trade-off

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,399
there that there's a compromise in how

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,760
well it can do all the different things

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,640
we want it to

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,279
we also grafana's out there there may be

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,960
a limit

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,640
there is a limit to the number of uis

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,279
that can do this that are these cross

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,559
connect multiple data source uh types of

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,080
tools there are some

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,760
um but they're they're not infinite by

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,600
any means and the last thing is it's

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,279
implied you know grafana has adapters

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,440
uh there's there's integrations work

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,120
here we have to make sure that the ui

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,720
can talk to all those data sources

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,399
fetch them down make sense of them you

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,960
know read the metadata understand what's

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,559
what

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,320
and really intelligently be able to

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,640
visualize that stuff

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,640
so uh definitely some pros and cons

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,120
there as well so between a lot of these

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,760
you know it might be uh some firms go

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,840
with one tool

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,279
some firms go with many tools some firms

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,519
integrate them you kind of merge all

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,960
onto one in one place or another a lot

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,360
of different options here and

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,039
it's really just what fits a given uh

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,440
enterprise what makes sense

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,120
in a given estate uh which of these

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,000
you're going to go with

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,559
but given that we can then think also

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,519
about

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,279
other elements of the platform i.e am i

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,279
going to run it or am i going to go sas

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,559
am i going to run it somewhere else and

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,840
so we can think of it if i'm running it

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,840
within my walls

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,120
or if i let somebody else run it what

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,919
are the trade-offs there what do we want

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,799
to do

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,159
looking at the on-prem version of this

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,559
there is a bit around

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,080
cost and access now cost it's going to

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,360
cost me hardware to run the

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,120
platform right i have to actually

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,720
provide the resources to do it but

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,399
that's a one-time cost that i can

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,840
ameliorate over time

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,360
sometimes that's appealing sometimes a

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,000
firm really wants that especially for

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,240
something like

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,279
like a monitoring tool that's always on

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,880
around the clock

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,440
lots of data to be you know stored

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,960
fetched accessed all the time

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,159
um if i'm putting it in the cloud i

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,360
might not have you know if it's a sas

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,039
solution like i mentioned i might not

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,760
have access to full granularity

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,519
uh you know and raw metrics i might not

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,080
want to access it as often as i would

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,399
like to

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,679
because it costs me to fetch data maybe

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,519
we would do some reports

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,279
that you know we're feeling like we you

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,120
know we're going to not do some reports

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,760
due to the cost associated with fetching

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,200
the data

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,279
where we would do them otherwise if it

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,799
was free to access it so definitely some

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,760
implications around

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,919
storage you know ownership and running

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,919
and access of the data

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,679
also just on ownership if i've got it

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,679
within my walls if i've got it within my

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,080
data you know my database or my

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,200
my systems just warm fuzzies sometimes

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,200
people just really like

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,799
having and holding and owning all of

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,360
their own information

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,360
and that's a perfectly valid reason

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,919
security here kind of comes off the back

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,240
of that

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,679
with a question mark conventional wisdom

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,880
would tell us that security it's more

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,159
secure on-prem

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,919
you know that's kind of the norm the

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,440
default that's what we've assumed and

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,960
you'll hear people just kind of state

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,919
that and we've been stating that for a

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,919
while

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,440
but it's not necessary it's not you know

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,960
it's not set in stone by any means you

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,399
know the cloud providers are being more

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,399
and more aggressive about trying to be

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,079
secure they're thinking more carefully

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,839
about it they're being more proactive

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,040
about it putting out better tooling to

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,520
help with this

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,480
uh you know they do prompt us to be more

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,119
secure they

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,960
they set more things by default and

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,280
disable certain things by default to try

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,399
to

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,200
force us into a secure um you know way

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,800
of running

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,560
and we have to turn things off if we

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,879
want to open things back up etc

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,480
so there's a lot that you know cloud

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,399
environments are trying to do

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,760
to make their you know to be competitive

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,280
to be more secure

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
and so that conventional wisdom it's

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,200
it's there maybe that wins out

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,280
maybe you know if you know for a given

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,359
type of firm the cloud tooling and

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,040
really adapting the cloud natively and

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,960
really fully immersing in it

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,400
and embracing it you know kind of whole

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,160
hog um

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,520
maybe that winds up being just as secure

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,119
or more secure

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,800
so it's a question mark it could go

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,880
either way really depending on a firm

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,040
and their relationship to this stuff

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,000
the last thing here connectivity legacy

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,839
elements remember we talked

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,720
about mainframes we talked about you

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,640
know hp ux machines or solaris or ax

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,480
i would never want to not have

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,359
visibility into those right i can't

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,400
imagine not

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,599
being able to see that stuff so how am i

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
going to how am i going to reach those

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,880
legacy

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,079
elements how am i going to have

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,599
visibility of them how am i going to

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,839
fetch data from them

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,720
especially if my monitoring tool is in

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,320
the cloud

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,320
that means that it needs to make an

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,400
inbound request against my firewall

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,440
through to one of my servers that's a

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,119
bit squeamish

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,800
if the monitoring platform at least some

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,520
element you know maybe it's half

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,560
uh is on prem it's already you know

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,920
close and local

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,119
and so there is still that connectivity

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,720
there but it's already within the same

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,320
firewall it's already within my

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,000
you know on-prem environment it can

00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,760
reach those legacy elements

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
uh you know without without that that

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,040
kind of questionable connectivity need

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,640
so a bit a bit more uh you know a bit

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,000
easier perhaps to do that that

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,320
visibility of the legacy elements and

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,079
have that connectivity if it's on-prem

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,440
now some firms might be completely cloud

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,520
native in which case

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,200
maybe this doesn't apply if it's all new

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,640
stuff if it's all cloud servers and

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,680
microservices then

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,320
you know no no no worries right uh so

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,320
it depends on the environment again but

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,200
when we look at the cloud stuff john

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,240
what does that do for us if we think

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,720
about hosting the

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,920
platform the cloud sure so you know

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,240
unless you're running

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,040
multiple tier four data centers the

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,640
cloud is

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,400
almost always going to be the most

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,040
reliable option and

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,200
is going to give you the best uptime

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,440
scalability is a big one for monitoring

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,800
your large scale monitoring solutions

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,280
usually require some

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,880
serious resources things like big and

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,599
fast storage to handle

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,720
databases that are performing an

00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,920
enormous

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,280
number of i o operations and a lot of

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,240
networking resources

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,320
to handle sometimes thousands of

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,599
messages a second

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,280
if you need to increase resources it's a

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,839
whole lot easier to do it with a few

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,200
clicks on the cloud rather than a

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,480
complete overhaul of your

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:22,000
on-prem storage arrays and

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,960
finally the cloud makes accessibility

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,920
anytime anywhere a much more viable

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,359
option

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,480
you think of managers and leadership

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,920
they like to have access to the

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,119
monitoring systems to either

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,200
periodically check in

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,880
or when they need to be running a triage

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,400
call typically

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,240
they're not going to be the ones getting

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,400
into the systems to fix them

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,160
and requiring them to break out their

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,760
laptop boot it up and then

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,160
connect to a vpn takes up a lot of time

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
that

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,440
could be spent trying to get to a

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,400
resolution when they could have just

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,400
pulled it up on their phone

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,920
right okay and then if we move on to

00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,680
another

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,119
consideration for monitoring platforms

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,800
simple versus complex

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,560
right there's simpler tools out there

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,359
there's more complex advanced ones out

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,280
there

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,440
what are the what are the pros and cons

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,560
of this if we keep it simple john where

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,599
does that take us

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,240
yeah so generally the less complex

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,079
a product is the less you can expect to

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,440
pay for it

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,720
also you can expect a straightforward

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,880
product to give you

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,640
straightforward information for example

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,560
if you're monitoring a server that's

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,480
eating a lot of memory you can expect

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,520
your alerts to be something like

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,760
ram usage over 95 you then

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,520
log on to the server find the problem

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,320
and you fix it

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,359
installations administration maintenance

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,480
configuration

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,960
are all going to be easier with alex

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,839
complex solution you know on the

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,880
downside

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,320
those straightforward alerts aren't

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,960
going to tell you a whole lot about root

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,599
cause and if they're not configured well

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,400
can create a whole lot of unnecessary

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,240
noise

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,160
imagine if your solution didn't have a

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,440
release hierarchy

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,280
and a vmware cluster goes down now you

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,720
have not only alerts for that cluster

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,480
being down but

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,640
your inbox or text messages are full of

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,560
hundreds more alerts for every single

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,240
check on every virtual machine that was

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,200
running on that cluster

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,040
right right we all know the the alert

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,119
floods haven't been haunted by those

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,680
once or twice definitely

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,680
okay and and the you know the complex

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,200
side of this is definitely the opposite

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,040
in a way we're looking for better

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,680
insights we're looking for

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,720
less noise um you know kind of more

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,280
compound

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,800
you know alerts and event correlation

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,640
it's going to take a lot of different

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,720
bits of data and bring it together

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,760
either by machine learning or ai or some

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,520
sort of tool

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,599
uh pattern recognition whatever it might

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,960
be and try to give us a

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,680
more complex compound but insightful

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,280
alert hopefully and so that's that's

00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,280
that ai ops buzzword you know

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,720
this is very very exciting everyone's

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,440
everyone's kind of jumping on this all

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,599
the time

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,880
but there is a headache to this there is

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,520
you know that's a more

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,040
involved tool we got to feed it more

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,599
data it probably wants to be hooked into

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,960
our change

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,880
management we probably need a really

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,240
good system inventory and what servers

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,720
are being upgraded when and what you

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,520
know

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,200
uh at looping that in it needs to be fed

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,920
a lot more to be able to do that we have

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,680
a more

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,680
you know it's machine learning uh you

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,079
know system or algorithm at the core of

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,880
it

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,800
that's a bigger thing to run uh probably

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,520
more hardware that we need to feed this

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
thing so a lot that we have to fuel this

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,760
for it to do that and

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,119
hopefully give us those better insights

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,200
which can be quite rewarding

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,560
not for a second saying they can't uh

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,000
but you know there's just a lot that

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,359
goes into actually giving this what it

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,280
needs for it to work

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,400
um ultimately all this is trying to cut

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,680
down mttr

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,839
you know reducing that mean time to

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,960
resolution getting things identified

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,240
uh discovered fixed quicker i always

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,119
like to point out that it's mean time to

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,520
resolution

00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,319
so it's not just mean time to detection

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,520
or mean time to identification or triage

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,079
or whatever the metric people want to

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,839
use

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,839
but actually closing the loop and having

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,599
the staff member fix it

00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,040
being able to take some action and

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,880
resolve the problem

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,560
and hopefully one one other layer of

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,280
complex not just ai ops and event

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,040
correlation

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,480
would be that the platform lets us take

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,880
actions too

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,560
it lets us you know uh right click and

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,160
run a stored procedure to free up some

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,119
space or right click and relaunch that

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,599
process or

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,359
whatever it might be to resolve the

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,359
underlying problem

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,480
and hopefully the platform the next

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,480
layer that would be if the platform

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,319
could automatically take those actions

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,720
and maybe this is a partnership of the

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,560
monitoring tool and some ci cd stuff

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,920
or some you know puppet chef some other

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,280
deployment stuff uh

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,040
or maybe it's right in the platform

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,560
itself that the you know the rules

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,800
engine can say hey

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,920
uh i you know i see this process is down

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,000
i'm going to automatically try to

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,680
restart it before i bother anyone at all

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,839
all right i've tried twice i can't get

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,680
it back up now i'll go alert someone and

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,720
they can tell me what to do next

00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,040
so definitely interactivity as well

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,079
uh and and some other you know some

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,119
other elements of that

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,960
that operations mindset to really uh

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,319
uh make sure that the stuff is working

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,200
both the iops and all that event

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,200
correlation

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,319
better insights niceness but there's

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,599
other things that we can do that are

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,800
complex that could also be really

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,119
rewarding

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,319
the last one here is bill versus buy and

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,400
and this one

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,560
nearly every firm you know talks about

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,599
this uh has a discussion about this

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,240
i see it all the time um people get

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,319
excited

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,280
you know you want to have really good

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,400
developer staff

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,920
who when they hear about something

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,680
they're like oh i can build that and

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,359
there's that self-determination there's

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,880
that that mojo that

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,040
you know that uh that confidence and

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,599
enthusiasm and energy

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,079
of we can build this thing uh which is

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,640
great

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,480
right it sounds super rewarding but is

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,079
it actually going to happen

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,680
right is it actually going to happen

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,000
will it be completed when will it be

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,200
completed how complete will it be

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,160
right do we actually get done everything

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,920
we thought we were going to get done um

00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,760
all of those questions can we be honest

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,880
with ourselves about how well this will

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,040
really work out

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,560
if we take off on a charge and go try to

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,480
try to put something together

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,160
and can we be honest with ourselves and

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,119
really accurately capture

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,560
all of the costs of this both the staff

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,359
time and the and the money that goes

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,160
into that

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,800
the costs of uh we have to wait for it

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,760
to be built

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,040
so if we're trying to implement a

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,800
monitoring solution not only is there

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,920
the install time and configuration time

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,000
and implementation time

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,599
but now we've added a whole set of time

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,880
just for development time

00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,119
that we've got to wait for things to be

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,560
done before uh we can use them

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,000
and that might be in a staged rollout

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
maybe some things are done ready before

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,160
others

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,240
but still i mean that that you know

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,760
there's a lot of hidden costs that can

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,119
be kind of a trap here

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,119
we can tailor it to ourselves it can be

00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,720
super bespoke uh you know we can make it

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,960
exactly the way we want it

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,839
uh so that that's a kind of a reward

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,920
that's kind of nice

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,880
but that implies maintenance headaches

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,400
that implies

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,319
you know when that developer moves on

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,000
eight years from now who knows why this

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,480
was built that way at that time

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
who knows how to run this thing um you

00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,839
know the more bespoke we are

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,240
the more we need to keep institutional

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,400
knowledge keep that legacy knowledge and

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,160
and be able to manage it ourselves and

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,400
ultimately there's no support there

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,760
right it's all internal um that's kind

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,359
of another hidden cost

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,720
you know how are we going to handle

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,079
support you know it might not just be

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,520
the developer time up front

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,760
but the support time and maintenance

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,079
time through the life's the life cycle

00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,400
of this app and of this initiative

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,240
so can be done some firms do it very

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,920
very well but there's a lot of pitfalls

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,119
and traps to really try to think through

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,640
very carefully

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,280
uh and try to be honest with ourselves

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,520
about before we before we embark on it

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,440
on the buy side john it can't be all

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,920
roses it can't be all grass is greener

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,040
what's going on on the buy side yeah so

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,480
as you mentioned

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,800
gabe both options have a cost

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,599
you can expect a purchase solution to

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,040
cost

00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,359
significantly more but on the nice side

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,160
it's

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,280
a known hard cost that's a lot easier to

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,920
budget for

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,960
than the guest work expenses of building

00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,079
a solution

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,880
right dollars on a page black and white

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,319
very very conspicuous even if it's even

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,760
if it's services i mean it's an add-on

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,560
like consulting services professional

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,560
services

00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,720
we at least know what they are up front

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,160
uh so definitely okay

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,800
right um you know and also as with

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,480
most companies monitoring providers are

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,839
very interested in acquiring new

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,040
customers

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:24,800
to do this we can reasonably expect that

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,160
a paid solution is going to be

00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,160
consistently

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,160
adding support for new technologies as

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,920
they become widely adopted

00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,200
so we can get a good level of future

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,839
proofing

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,599
and support's a big one uh it's a lot

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,079
easier to open up a ticket with your

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,400
vendor

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,160
than it is to convince the guy who built

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,880
your solution eight years ago and then

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,839
quit

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,280
to help you out at some obnoxious

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,960
freelance rate just to get you up and

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,079
going again

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:55,119
now you know another downside is

00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,480
while we do get a pre-built product with

00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,800
a wide range of features and

00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,240
integrations we are limited to what that

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,079
vendor has to offer

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,319
it may not provide the coverage in

00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,119
certain areas that we were hoping for

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:10,000
and in just about all cases we're gonna

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,880
have to make some compromises

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,160
right sure but there's a coral area here

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,000
being pre-built

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,599
and you talked about the monitoring

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,839
companies and businesses

00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,680
uh they're selling enterprise tools

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,599
there's a hope that we know this is

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,560
ready for scale it's ready for

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,280
you know the firm wide enterprise use

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,800
it's already been

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,960
you know tested built and tested and

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,560
being run on other big firms

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,079
whereas when we build something maybe we

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,520
need to do a bit more testing around

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,280
scaling and making sure that it'll

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,839
actually work the way we want uh

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,119
enterprise wide and at scale but nice

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,160
all right so good some good pros and

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,400
cons there too

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,319
so we're just about at time we're going

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,560
to do a bit of a recap

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,319
uh just some closing thoughts certainly

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,920
if people have questions that come to

00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,040
mind start to put them in the chat

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,800
channel now

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,040
uh and and then we'll try to address

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,319
those but before we turn to them john do

00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,680
you have any closing thoughts where's

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,240
your head at with all this

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,520
yeah sure uh you know today we gave you

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,920
a whole lot of questions

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,280
and as much as i wish we could have we

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,680
really didn't give you

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,280
any answers and that's because there

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,400
just aren't answers that are right for

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,960
everybody

00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,839
gabe and i we work with organizations

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,839
every day who

00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,680
all have different needs sometimes we're

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:22,960
able to meet a customer's need with

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,960
a simple single on-prem solution

00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,680
other times we're forced to use multiple

00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,640
products with complex integrations that

00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,000
span both on-prem and sometimes multiple

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,040
cloud providers

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,520
it all just depends what your

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,400
organization's individual needs are our

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,839
intention here

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,760
is that you're leaving well

00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,920
well-equipped with the information that

00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,040
you need for the next time that you need

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,000
to add or

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,920
overhaul your own monitoring solution

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,440
yeah absolutely a bit of a buyer's guide

00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,960
a bit of a lay of the land

00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,319
what considerations should we be

00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,000
thinking through what questions should

00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,720
we be asking ourselves as we go through

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,119
this

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,319
um you know just briefly and i'll open

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,040
up the q and a here maybe we have a

00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,040
question

00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,559
uh what i'll do the recap and then we'll

00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,079
go through all the

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,520
questions people have what collection

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,359
coverage is needed right we've gone

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,119
through that we know what's out there

00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,200
at least in the course terms and broad

00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,119
strokes how many tools to have

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,720
is it you know definitely not infinity

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,480
and definitely not zero there's some

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,359
happy medium that's the right

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,640
you know blend for your company um to

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,319
have the right number of tools

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,400
how to pick tools what are the

00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,319
considerations that go into that

00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,839
and you know how do we go through that

00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:33,200
choosing process how do we go through

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,720
that buying process

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,640
do i want to host it on-prem versus

00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,160
cloud cloud is a big buzzword everyone

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,839
gets very excited about it it has some

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,520
great use cases you know certainly

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,880
short-lived workloads bursting into the

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,160
cloud scalability

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,079
but do we want to have this thing

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,599
running there around the clock maybe

00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,240
maybe not so there's some considerations

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,720
there

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,240
building versus buying lots of things to

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,880
think through and try to be careful

00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,400
about

00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,000
try to be honest with ourselves and do

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,720
some soul searching on and then the

00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
complexity

00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,839
you know do we want more complex less

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,079
complex where do we want complexity

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,839
what does it cost us and what is the

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,119
what's involved in getting that to work

00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,480
for us

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,599
uh you can certainly reach out to us

00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,800
everyone i'll just call this out and

00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,800
we'll do the q a

00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,319
um you know reach out to us at the

00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,280
company website you can reach me you can

00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,559
reach john

00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,960
all right so so given this uh someone's

00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,200
asking can your tool itrs monitor

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,640
monitor containers yeah so we have

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,000
container monitoring

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:28,640
um that that is something that we do uh

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,240
we do that both in our our well the

00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,720
genios monitoring uh

00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,599
product is the one that i'm you know

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,760
more uh

00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,119
expertise in uh we have a whole solution

00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,440
around container monitoring

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,640
and orchestration and how we get stuff

00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,559
off the container

00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,400
uh platform exactly like we said and

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,280
then do app stuff on top of it

00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,839
so that's the model there uh op5 monitor

00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,200
if that's

00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,200
if that's the product that the person's

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,640
referring to uh we're still kind of

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,240
building that out a bit

00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,680
uh you know we know how to do it but

00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,359
bringing it into that product

00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,520
you know is is something on the on the

00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,000
to-do are there any hybrid

00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,800
uh hybrid i assume it's hybrid models of

00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,800
diy

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,160
and buy where we can buy something that

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,839
will get us up and running but gives us

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,160
a lot of room to develop and expand

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,599
phenomenal question yeah i can i can go

00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,400
with this one gabe

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,760
we do this we do this all the time so

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,400
where we'll have

00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,319
you know a commercial product and you

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,920
know maybe there's

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,680
we talked about how there can be gaps

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,160
you know with uh you know an all-in-one

00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,599
product

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,800
or things like that but sometimes

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,599
there's an open source solution that's

00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,400
out there

00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,160
and we frequently will build

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,440
integrations to work with

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,520
you know work with those open source um

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,960
you know projects that are out there or

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,160
maybe even one that you're already

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,200
running

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,680
that's extremely common to to mix um

00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,960
to fix that and great question we

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,599
probably probably should have put that

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,920
in there as

00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,440
a hybrid option yeah well all of these

00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,880
things can work in concert we kind of

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,319
implied that a bit that these are

00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,839
mix and match and this is the person

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,480
totally getting it thinking about mix

00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,079
and match

00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,520
we're a firm that's very open to

00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,760
integration very

00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,119
open to working with other tools you

00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,800
know we do everything

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,400
well but if you've got something like

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,680
corville that does that on the wire

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,640
really good network visibility and you

00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,480
really like it

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,319
pull it in by all means if you've got

00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,680
some in-house solution that instruments

00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,040
one app really well and you want those

00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,400
metrics from wherever they are

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,599
there's plug-ins to fetch them from

00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,599
there there's plug-ins to get them into

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,640
the platform so totally this is a very

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,960
very valid

00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,000
uh way of kind of doing a hybrid uh

00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,599
solution

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,400
bringing different different solutions

00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,200
together uh what is its doing about ai

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,599
ops

00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,680
so the some of that interactivity piece

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,240
i was talking about the automation

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,359
of taking action we've had that in for

00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,960
quite a while

00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,559
and that's you know i think just a

00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,040
subset or a limited

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,119
part of the ai ops discussion at large

00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,760
another thing that we've had to do

00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,200
is kind of take our data model in-house

00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,960
historically we've been letting

00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,280
you know people run it in tabular like

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,119
mysql databases or oracle databases

00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,280
so we're building that into our data a

00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,880
clustered data store that we own and run

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,720
getting the schema getting the model

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,400
down so we can work off of it and the

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,559
first thing that that allows us to do

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,400
keep lots of history and then use it to

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,119
project forward start to do

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,040
uh kind of smart rules that look on what

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,280
the history of the metric was to

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,640
kind of determine normal that's a first

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,720
you know first first uh

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,400
uh pass at it there's gonna be more

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,839
things in that vein to come

00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,319
but it was really just that we need to

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,880
own the data model for us to be able to

00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,000
start to do smart things with it how do

00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,920
you integrate with other vendor

00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,880
frameworks products in case one wants to

00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,160
migrate

00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,240
yeah that's a good question and it

00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,480
really varies based on what the vendor

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,000
product is you know different things are

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,960
easier to migrate from

00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,640
and and to and whatnot uh we're pretty

00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,480
darn open to integrations we're pretty

00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,839
darn open to the number of places we can

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,839
collect data from

00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,280
so you know very curious what that

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,599
vendor tool is that the

00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,040
the question is around a lot of firms

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,359
are coming off of something

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,880
right and so having a an ability to make

00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:56,720
that transition have an initiative have

00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,280
a project and smoothly move

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,800
from a to b and still have have coverage

00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,079
it's pretty important

00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,160
sometimes you take it in a tiered

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,599
approach just get the basics in then do

00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,240
some more advanced stuff then switch

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,760
this over

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,680
et cetera et cetera so you kind of build

00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,640
up a project uh you know roadmap for

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,839
that

00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,520
is there an app store for gave us

00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:16,559
plugins for this one i can i can speak

00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,200
at least to

00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,760
to one part of a guy one part of what we

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,200
do

00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:26,400
so our op5 monitor product

00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,280
as we develop it we are

00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,240
very careful to ensure that it is 100

00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,400
compatible with

00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,359
nagios plugins which is an open source

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,640
project

00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:39,040
and for that i mean there's

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,839
there's an exchange for plug-ins there

00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,400
sometimes

00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,920
they're plug-ins dell for example has a

00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,640
plugin that they write and they even

00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,119
support

00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,000
um on their own so there's plugins

00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,119
available i mean

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,720
you search for nagios plugins on github

00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,599
you get a ton of them and those can just

00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,119
be

00:53:53,599 --> 00:54:01,599
dropped right into right into uh our op5

00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,359
monitor product gabe can you maybe

00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,280
give some information maybe around some

00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:08,480
of our other products and how we handle

00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,079
plug-ins yeah i mean so look there's a

00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,359
lot of plug-ins i think it's like 200

00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,079
plugins or something available out of

00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,079
the box

00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,359
i'm just bringing the question up back

00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,040
here so that's just

00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,720
that's our app store in some sense those

00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,319
are all the plugins we list

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,000
and make available they're compiled into

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,440
the agents you've got access to them you

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,160
can turn them on at any time

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,800
uh you know just in your monitoring then

00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,839
we also

00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,280
lit we also offer supported integrations

00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:33,119
so that's kind of like an app store

00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,240
where we're listing things that we've

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,280
used those off the show

00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:39,599
jmx or you know some the rest api

00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,359
querier to do an integration with

00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,400
mongodb or whatever it might be right

00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,720
nginx

00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,200
uh and we post those publicly supported

00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,000
formal dust and dust done and dusted uh

00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,160
integrations

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,839
that's kind of an app store in a way and

00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,359
then the last category of stuff is like

00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:55,839
we've done consulting work

00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,440
we have some solution we've done it's

00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,319
not formally released and kind of

00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,400
productionized

00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,920
but it still is darn helpful right and

00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,520
we can give that out to clients when

00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,079
it's when it's pertinent and appropriate

00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,760
so

00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,839
a couple different layers of where we

00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,200
have you know quote unquote plug-ins

00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,720
where we have integrations

00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,319
but definitely a lot of stuff is

00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,319
available just right out of the gate

00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:16,720
um on our website or in the agents

00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,920
themselves or in the platform itself

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,599
uh what are your thoughts on auto

00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,119
discovery and spider diagrams i trust

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,760
genius seems to lack it yeah this is

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,559
something i

00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,599
you know i vocalize uh definitely i

00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,319
whoever this is

00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,359
uh uh probably someone i know maybe even

00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,240
corroborate you know

00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:33,040
and am of the same mind um we're looking

00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,960
at it you know

00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,559
we do take it seriously it hasn't been

00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,079
something we've done historically

00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,240
and it is a place where we would say you

00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,720
know if you've got a tool that you

00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,480
really

00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:46,240
like for that um do let's do both

00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,920
let's let's do our thing where we work

00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,359
really well and and their thing where

00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,839
they work really well especially like

00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,760
network

00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,000
scanning discovery and then and then

00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,480
diagrams um which is what that question

00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,599
it sounded like was around so i hope we

00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,599
add more of that in

00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,079
uh but you know at the moment that would

00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,079
be kind of the road forward with it

00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,640
how does idris provide countermeasures

00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,960
during live production faults

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,640
i do not know exactly what this person

00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,480
means maybe they can write it again with

00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,760
a bit more information

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,599
i don't know if they mean like hot

00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,200
standby of the monitoring platforms that

00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,400
the marring platform is resilient to

00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,520
production faults

00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,440
or if they mean the uh the repair

00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,599
actions the platform can run when

00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,440
there's an issue so if something breaks

00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,960
and you've let us you've configured it

00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,960
to the software knows to do it

00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,319
it'll automatically try to do some some

00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,319
fixes first

00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:35,599
uh on its own before it even bothers you

00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:38,079
before it uh

00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,440
before it even uh you know alerts or

00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,559
anything like that yeah repair actions

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,119
that's exactly what they are and we've

00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,720
got like

00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,880
three people jumping in on the same idea

00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,799
there um repair actions

00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,240
right and they're open-ended and

00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,599
configurable um

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,200
it does take a little bit of you know

00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,559
input right the thing the system is not

00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,559
gonna know what to do

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,920
if you don't tell it what to do and not

00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,200
everybody wants to even enable that

00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,040
there's authentication there there's

00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,559
permissioning there it's sensitive right

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,760
to say okay the monitoring platform is

00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,559
going to be stopping and starting

00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,160
processes

00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,680
that's a fairly privileged interaction

00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,040
you know action so

00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,799
it is something where you know you

00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,000
configure it you turn it on you use it

00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,359
where you feel comfortable

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,040
maybe a lot of the time you stay with

00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,960
the human in the loop model

00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,720
uh and have a human make that decision

00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,240
but definitely repair actions

00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,160
it's one of the one of the things the

00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,960
product i think does pretty darn well

00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,079
by way of ease and speed of the support

00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,400
staff to be able to fix

00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,520
things and cutting down that mttr versus

00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,400
just mean time to

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,079
discovery or detection some concern from

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,440
users who use old operating systems and

00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,559
running active console in their local

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,319
machine they have to restart a couple

00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,839
times a day this sounds like a very

00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,839
specific question from an

00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,960
existing user is there a plan to have a

00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,160
web url which have all the

00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,319
functionalities of ac

00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,920
like app dynamics sure and and that's a

00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,359
good it's a it's a fair question right

00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,200
so the thick client

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,480
will probably always be around there'll

00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,920
be new generations of it we're going to

00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,040
overhaul it that's something we're

00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,599
already working on

00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,359
uh to make it you know just it's got it

00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,440
needs it it needs to be overhauled

00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:01,280
and redone but there's always going to

00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,160
be the desire for the power users to

00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,920
have

00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,280
uh you know a thick client where they

00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,000
can completely customize it configure it

00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,480
etc

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,839
we are adding in a web ui um that's

00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,839
being done off of the back of that

00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,359
cluster data store that i talked about

00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,640
uh you know in some sense we needed to

00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,960
have a place that we were storing the

00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,880
data that we could do a web ui off of

00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,880
so there is a web ui happening it

00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,640
probably won't be exactly parity with

00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,440
the console like you might not have

00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,280
interaction

00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,720
for example but from a read-only

00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,520
perspective from being able to

00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,559
investigate

00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,240
c chart dashboard etc that's the

00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,760
direction that that's going and most of

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,040
the other tools that have web uis they

00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,200
tend to be read-only

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,880
um so you know that that's kind of in

00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,160
parity and then the thick client

00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,240
probably would be the place where you'd

00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,160
have that power user stuff really really

00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,440
custom views and then the interactivity

00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,240
the ability to take action

00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,440
etc uh i realize that's a mouthful all

00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,160
of those people please by all means

00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,920
reach out to us

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,280
reach out to your reps if you're you

00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,480
know if you're an existing customer or

00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,119
if you're already talking to somebody at
