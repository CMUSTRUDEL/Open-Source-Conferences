impressed because I have no slides and

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:09,630
and you know I get it now that I'm I'm

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,710
here so for any of you who don't realize

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,530
what's going on

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,039
two brilliant women data scientist

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:21,119
professor and they're followed by an

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,310
enterprise legacy old guy all right so

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,619
so bring that back to your companies

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,930
bring that bring that message really

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,650
loud and clear if you don't understand

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,790
it come see me afterwards so I have no

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,040
slides I'm really just here to tell or

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:40,410
share a story of where we're at in in

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,149
our brief few minutes together about a

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,700
month ago we completed the development

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,700
phase and moved into user acceptance

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,809
testing with the financial industry with

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,690
the project to take a mainframe

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,520
application that's over ten years old

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,550
and move it to distributed ledger

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,879
technology the technologies built on a

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,010
private permission version of aetherium

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,510
open source we're using hyper ledger

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,670
Explorer as part of the governance

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,860
function we use third-party vendors we

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,770
partnered with a start-up and it's

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,520
completely in the cloud those of you who

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,990
know DTCC might be saying who is this

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,780
guy and what have you done with my

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,610
steady stable DTCC

00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:28,200
for those of you who don't know us let

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:33,090
me let me share are who we are and and

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,659
introduce ourselves so DTCC let me start

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,810
with a big number 1.6 quadrillion that's

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,509
that is actually a number it's the

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,409
amount of dollars in trading activity

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,180
that we processed last year our very

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,549
first innovation about forty five years

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,990
ago is to take paper stock certificates

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,619
that we're moving around Wall Street

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,070
with runners and bicycle riders and

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,450
messengers put them in a vault and

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,420
computerized the industry ledger and the

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,549
settlement of equity trades so we make

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,310
sure that buyers would would get their

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,400
stock if they bought sellers would get

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,200
their money if they if they sold over

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,830
the years we've added a variety of other

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,410
product

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,030
and services for the industry about half

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,250
our revenue now is coming from things

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,960
that we didn't even do products that

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,970
didn't even exist 15 years ago

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,490
we're owned and governed by the

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,610
financial industry and our mission and

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,460
purpose is to lead the industry mitigate

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,730
risks lower costs and build processing

00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:38,070
efficiencies that's our entire

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,140
motivation there there is no conflict

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:43,710
there's no public shares of DTCC

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,160
and our entire goal is to create safe

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:51,590
and sound markets and make sure that we

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,240
can operate those markets in a reliable

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,340
continuous fashion every single day

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,910
we're considered systemically critical

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,430
financial infrastructure we plot provide

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:06,510
a range of services in the United States

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,460
and we provide services globally as a

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,200
systems that are expected to be up and

00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,690
processing that runs every day we're

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,120
regulated by by regulators around the

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,180
world including the security Exchange

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,530
Commission the Federal Reserve Bank the

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,220
New York State banking commission the

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,350
CFTC the FCA the MAS and over 40

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,260
different regulatory bodies so we're

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,490
very heavily regulated

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,430
we're very regular we're very

00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:34,920
risk-averse we have a proud mainframe

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:41,130
legacy we have a collection of 60

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:43,680
million lines of COBOL code our db2 RPG

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,340
JCL some of the original favorite

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,710
acronyms of of the technology industry

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,980
so so with all of that background let me

00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:55,530
explain how we do innovation how we've

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,140
adopted open source how we're working

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,020
with with hyper ledger and distributed

00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,900
ledger and basically how we manage the

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:06,240
tension between our strategy and the

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,610
desire to support innovation and the

00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,690
corporate antibodies that desire to

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:15,420
identify it seek it out and kill it so

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,400
so how do we innovate let me take back

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:22,820
to the the our mission of leadership

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,710
focusing on risk lowering costs and and

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,000
finding efficiencies our number one

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,450
priority at DTCC

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,240
is is always to lower lower risk we

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,490
focus on single points of failure

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,940
operational risk resiliency we have

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,810
teams that are completely focused on

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,729
business continuity we run tests or

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,190
preparations for tests or a tabletops

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,700
about tests almost every single weekend

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,680
all year long we have those cycles and

00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,450
risk reviews of almost every single

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,600
thing that we implement everything that

00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,810
we do so when we started looking at open

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,790
source over a dozen years ago we meet

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,960
the very first thing we did was say

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,570
let's start with a risk perspective

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,530
let's bring in our legal team let's

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,570
educate them let's make them understand

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,580
what the issues are around copyleft

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,700
let's let them understand what the

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,040
letter is WTF PL mean for those of you

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,479
who know what those letters mean if you

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,169
don't look them up it's one of the more

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,850
interesting open source licenses for

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:28,979
cloud we established a cloud review

00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,530
Council made up of all of our control

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:34,080
functions so the cloud review council

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,940
has over a dozen members and probably

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,040
three-quarters of them are from control

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,710
functions that our entire functional

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,430
units in the corporation operations risk

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:48,270
business continuity information -

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:51,990
security physical risk so basically

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:54,840
every aspect of how we might look at an

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,240
application or the data externally we

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,490
have this control function to review it

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,200
but their goal is to say what are the

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,850
risks how would they mitigate those

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,280
risks and if we mitigate those risks

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,680
appropriately what are the steps to move

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,390
forward so the goal is always how do we

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,169
move forward how do we get the ball up

00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,580
field and score points so it's not about

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:17,100
squashing innovation the goal is

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,260
figuring out how to work with your

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,180
control teams how do you work with with

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,660
all the groups that are focused on risk

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,490
and and enable innovation

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:29,669
second leadership almost everything that

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,450
we do is and everything that we provide

00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:34,409
is an industry function we provide a

00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,810
settlement and clearing system for the

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:39,390
entire industry we replied regulatory

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,880
for the global industry so when we move

00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:45,840
it means we have to move with the entire

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,940
industry so creating the leadership

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,560
creating those the first movers creating

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,110
the idea means building industry

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,000
consensus it means getting everyone on

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,350
board that this is the right thing to do

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
for the industry this is the way to

00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,420
innovate and move the industry forward

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,890
but then once you move the the challenge

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,330
is probably less building the

00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,550
application it's actually getting

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,880
adoption building is really easy

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,430
retiring old is really hard so moving

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,880
the industry to a new standard getting

00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,770
them to migrate existing trades existing

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,870
processes existing reference data

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,670
existing connections to something new

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:25,140
and then adopting something new like

00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,480
adopting a distributed ledger node

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,640
bringing all of that to the industry and

00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:35,370
getting adoption is a lot of what we

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:37,820
focus on next third is cost everything

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,770
we do has a business case everything we

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,620
propose all of our innovations we've

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,900
established a number of internal shark

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,180
tank equivalents where we have an

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,250
Innovation Fund and then Innovation Fund

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,229
has to deal with things like end-of-life

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,169
it has to deal with things like an

00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:59,130
annual or a regular refresh cycle for

00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:01,380
networks for our internal technology but

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,640
it also addresses has to address things

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,040
like how do we move the organization

00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,410
forward you know what do we invest in

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,060
open source even if there's not going to

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,450
be an immediate return what is that

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,130
long-term return distributed ledger how

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,979
do we get involved what are the right

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,930
steps to invest in it what are the steps

00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,010
we should take now what are the steps we

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,720
know we're gonna have to take in the

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,700
future because the technology is gonna

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,260
change anything you do now you know

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,240
you're gonna be replacing in a few years

00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,370
so what are the steps that we should do

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,990
moving forward and where is the business

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,909
case and what does that revenue look

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,710
like so there's literally shark tank

00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,300
activities that we that go on in a

00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,120
regular basis in tight inside the

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,789
organization groups make pitches they

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,500
show what their current results are what

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,670
they've accomplished to date whether it

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,360
makes sense to keep going with this

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:50,670
project or it's time to shut it down and

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,800
and lastly it's around

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,320
efficiencies what do we what are we

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,690
doing that can either improve internal

00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,370
processes or improve our clients

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,020
experience and we've spent a lot of time

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,110
over the last few years on client

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,570
experience the legacy of DTCC for those

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,670
of you who have worked with DTCC is

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,040
where the plumbing the plumbing is

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,000
supposed to be boring

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,190
generally the plumbing is supposed to be

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,660
boring and unseen behind the walls you

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,250
go to the bathroom you don't want to see

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,680
what's behind the walls you don't want

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,620
to see what's in the pipes but what what

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,010
you know came to probably the the

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,810
biggest public eye ten five or ten years

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,120
ago probably you know getting close to

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:33,270
ten years ago is when there were a

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,800
variety of scandals in the financial

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:41,370
industry in particular the madoff

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,260
scandal where and and I often point to

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,960
two different movies that maybe you have

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,730
seen I think ones on Netflix one might

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,670
be on HBO there's one with Robert De

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,110
Niro is as as Bernie Madoff one with

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,450
Richard Dreyfuss as Bernie Madoff

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,520
in both of those cases he's running this

00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,230
scheme he's making lots of money he's

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,030
being investigated he pushed out it

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,800
pushes off the regulators he pushes off

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,990
the investigators says here are my

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,350
reports don't worry about it and then in

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:09,420
both movies there's this scene where the

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,240
regulator says oh and what's your dtc

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,790
number and they want the dtc number so

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,550
they can go to the GT screen DTCC screen

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,740
and look up Madoff and be able to see

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,440
his account what he holds and in both

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,090
movies they're suddenly ominous music he

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,620
goes home he's hanging his head

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,820
you know both Richard and IFAs and

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,210
Robert DeNiro do it in a slightly

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,590
different way and there's they're

00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,120
looking out the curtain waiting for the

00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,730
police car to pull up because he knows

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,980
if they look at the dtc screen they'll

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,530
see instead of the 50,000 shares of

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,580
verizon that he told all his clients

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:46,500
that he has he has 20 so as soon as that

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,750
happens he knows he'll be going to jail

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,180
his thing exhausted no police car shows

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,170
up they never looked at the screen he

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,850
goes on his merry way

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,830
until you know you know you know what

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,240
happened in that story but the you know

00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,680
the realization there and I think the

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,250
realization for the industry in

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,940
particular as this technology emerged

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,880
distributed ledger is that

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,270
there's an opportunity to improve the

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,550
capabilities that exist so so all that

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:15,310
the the leadership focusing on risk

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,380
focusing on cost and focusing on on

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,170
efficiencies have kind of led us to

00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:23,590
where we are today with open source and

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,420
with hyper ledger I I want to first talk

00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:29,290
about the project that I mentioned

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,840
earlier so this project was a trade

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:34,390
information warehouse for credit default

00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,950
swaps it's been it has been in the media

00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,510
over the last couple of years we've been

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,640
working on development for about 18

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,420
months we worked with the entire

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,220
industry

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,770
the industry said this is a good place

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,720
to focus because it's an old application

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,960
when we turn on the new we could turn

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,720
off the old so this is a good place to

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,030
to to focus all of our efforts it's an

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,550
ideal candidate because it's a very

00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:00,600
well-defined asset type it's a very

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,190
well-defined set of transactions and

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,020
everyone in the industry was aligned

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,830
with this is the the right place to

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,540
focus an initial use case so we created

00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,760
the appropriate working groups we

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,730
created a very transparent process

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,310
within the community of how to pick a

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,860
vendor and how to implement the project

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,690
we've gone through the project with the

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,880
entire industry we do constant lessons

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,010
learned for those of you who work with

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,200
open source and particularly a developer

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,880
is working with aetherium some of the

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,180
interesting points that you learn is

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,430
it's like going back back to the future

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,650
or back to the past some of the problems

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,870
we dealt with 30 and 20 and 30 years ago

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,000
where a database problem would say

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,160
database error and you'd have no idea

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,290
where that error is but it's a database

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,420
error theory and we'll say out of guess

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,070
you have no idea where the error is but

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,380
you're out of gas you're basically

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,720
burning burning all your well your

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,810
energy because the smart contract can't

00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,880
process so all of the the things that

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,190
you've learned in technology continue to

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,870
apply all the tools that need to be

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,730
built will continue to be built over the

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:10,900
next five or ten years as the technology

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,090
matures but it takes enterprises trying

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,920
to move this forward it takes industry

00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,810
and communities trying to move the

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,520
technology forward to get to those

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,300
advances

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:25,210
so we've we've moved that technology now

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,720
into into client testing we expect to be

00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:31,180
live before or after after brexit

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,000
another thing we're seeing is to my

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,160
earlier point about client client

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,800
onboarding and client acceptance a lot

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,630
of firms that said we want you to to to

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,970
give us an ode now we're saying alright

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,080
we're about to go live where do you want

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,370
us to put your note do you want to

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,020
install it in your shop do you want to

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,630
put it in a cloud vendor they're saying

00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,240
well can you run the note for us with

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,680
we're not quite ready to take a note we

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,930
haven't figured out exactly how we're

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,580
gonna integrate with that note so we're

00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,560
looking at what those processes are

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,510
going to be if we have to enable clients

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,550
to take notes and we have to run notes

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,050
for them for a period of time so we've

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,180
spent a lot of time on what that

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,790
onboarding process will look like what

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,110
the governance model looks like and we

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,900
realized as we're building out

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,730
governance that hyper ledger Explorer

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,070
which is a project that we've been

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,610
leading and working on with hyper ledger

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:24,880
is an opportunity for DTCC to leverage

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:27,760
open source and build a governance

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,840
process that allows us to see what nodes

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,640
are up see what clients are using using

00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,800
their nodes make sure that the network

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,500
is operating properly try and find

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:43,120
problems when they occur and if we need

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:45,340
to kind in interrupt processing and fix

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,310
something that's going wrong build the

00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,780
right tooling to be able to support that

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:52,090
so there are many other discussions and

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,960
projects in our pipeline one of the

00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:58,030
interesting things we found is is that

00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,860
by by investing in open source and

00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:03,130
working with the with the hyper ledger

00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,440
project and leading some projects we've

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,740
been able to recruit more talent we've

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,020
have held meetups in in Tampa this week

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,870
the very first hyper ledger meetup was

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:16,180
held at DTCC literally a few weeks after

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,800
a hyper ledger started we've held a

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,170
meet-up at our office in Chennai and

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,350
these meetups mean you know in DTCC

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,940
offices we're hosting 40 50 100 people

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,280
that come in and talk about different

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,050
topics about distributed ledger about

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,940
FinTech some some of these things have

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:34,960
evolved into hackathons

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,390
so getting involved in open-source not

00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,310
just taking from open sources which is

00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,350
what DTCC and the financial industry

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,540
have done for for for many years but

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,210
contributing back has really returned

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,640
benefits has really created a new set of

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:51,370
energy inside of the organization it's

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,850
turned some of our processes around risk

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:57,250
and legal review into instead of just a

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,620
purely defensive perspective you know

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,570
what is it we can do that that enables

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,940
the industry to move forward what code

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,100
can we contribute back that we'll be

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,470
able to help firms take advantage of

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,840
some of the lessons that we're learning

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,670
and be able to implement them either in

00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,470
the financial industry or potentially

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,780
you know in in other industries that are

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,580
using distributed ledger so I wanted to

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,320
share kind of where we're at and how

00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,120
we've progressed the brilliant

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,160
partnership that is evolved with hyper

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,950
ledger and Linux Foundation in

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,260
particular working with Brian and on the

00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,790
other members of that organization about

00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,830
different opportunities that we might

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:36,070
pursue and just you know what it takes

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:40,060
for an enterprise to kind of change its

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:43,510
its long history and legacy to to adopt

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,880
and and integrate with with where the

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,640
technology is today but at the same time

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,250
not lose sight of its mission to lead

00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,720
focus on risk cost efficiencies and and

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,320
processing efficiencies

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,320
thank you very much

00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,640
