	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,689
good morning everyone pleasure to be

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,490
with you all here today as per the

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,610
introduction my background really is

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,860
combining academia and applied work in

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,240
technology so I'm a professor of an

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,429
advanced technology particularly

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,049
specializing in blockchain and AI so a

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,940
nice kind of integration of what we've

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,609
had so far today and obviously applied

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,230
practice in the technology field my

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,640
particular passion I'm doing a lot of

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,529
work in the UN at the moment I've just

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,599
come back from a weak speaking there

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,490
with a new assembly and also as part of

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,619
the SDG week is how we can really

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,989
harness the power of emergent technology

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,950
for wider social impact I mean looking

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,350
at the schedule here over the last

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,210
yesterday and today it is a fantastic

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,890
focus on the technology and what I

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,870
really wanted to do was give more of a

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,879
focus on the applied nature of that and

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,070
how we can do great business but also do

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,320
really good business that has wider

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,210
societal benefit to that's really my

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,949
passion and also to give some balance to

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,809
what we sometimes see in the media that

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,699
kind of focuses sometimes on the darker

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,410
side of technology to kind of bring that

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,180
back a little bit and say what we can

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,530
actually achieve by applying that and

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,600
working together collaboratively so yes

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,610
so first of all to talk about trust I

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,970
think the figure there is quite stark a

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,790
17 year all-time low and that's not just

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,650
in corporate sectors and NGO the big

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,080
banks for example that is across the

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,360
globe even in charity sectors and social

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,310
enterprise and things like blockchain

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,350
with the ability to embed trust can make

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,790
a real difference here so I wanted to

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,680
kind of bring the context around this

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,140
trust issue and what we need to do to

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,549
resolve that and classic examples there

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,650
don't really need much explanation but

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,750
really big names in very different

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,530
fields all are suffering from this lack

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,420
of trust and times are changing I work a

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,100
lot with young people I've actually got

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,299
my own foundation called aspirational

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,649
futures that I'll be coming back to a

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,630
little bit later on in the talk I

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,579
passionately care about how we get more

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,079
people involved in this how we bring

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,790
different sectors together and

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,500
particularly around young people the

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,630
stats there around my Leonard was in

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,729
particular there's a real contagion of

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,710
interest here about doing work that's

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,110
got shared value people don't want to

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,610
rock up for their job and not be doing

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,020
more than that they want something that

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,599
are doing to have real meaning real

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,099
purpose be able to go away happy but

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,900
their values outside of their working

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,709
practice match what they're doing within

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,120
it

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,290
we need to create more opportunities

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,000
that and again that it's very

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,680
cross-sectoral and an approach and all

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,049
the projects I'm advising on and my new

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,180
CEO role is all about bringing these

00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,439
things together and harnessing it and I

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,920
think yeah the stats there really speak

00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:31,530
for themselves also in terms of context

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,170
we've got massive messy problems across

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,549
the world again affecting every nation

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,989
should we have really from the social

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:38,340
side of things to environmental

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,500
challenges to climate change to

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,030
education very much harness by the

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,590
framework of the Social Development

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,370
Goals they've been brought together by

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,810
the UN figures here speak for themselves

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,459
1.5 million people can't prove the

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,319
identity and that doesn't just have

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,870
implications for banking and be adding

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,129
access a bank account and institutions

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,810
it has massive implications for

00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:00,720
education as well I think that that

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,220
number that visual it says everything is

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,750
a massive problem we don't have

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,310
education as a building blocks for life

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,560
everything we're doing with technology

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,560
will not fill it fill its full potential

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,689
again in terms of challenges we've got

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,489
issues with power the electricity one

00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:20,280
there 85 percent of the world's

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:23,519
population does not have full access

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,930
that is affordable reliable or clean 15

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,389
percent there it's a staggering number

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,220
and again around food supplier spent a

00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,199
lot of time out in Mexico and also in

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,690
Brazil looking at the food supply chains

00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,419
looking at ethical food supply chain and

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,949
what's happening people are not you had

00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,569
to earn their full capacity for what

00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:40,859
they're growing so we've got problems

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,479
from the bottom line where farmers are

00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:44,310
growing crops then getting to the end

00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,370
producer where things have been taken

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,690
away when the money has been lost and

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,669
when trees for example have been

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,010
destroyed in the process of growing so

00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:54,389
food is a fantastic example I've spent

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,190
time in the Meno region in particular

00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,019
and we don't always see so much of this

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,419
in the US and the UK but it's a

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,859
substance has amazing qualities so it

00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,750
comes from the gorillas tree and at the

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,280
moment most of the time to actually

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,629
create that reaction you have to

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,760
basically have an infection in the bark

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,650
for it to produce this particular oil it

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,079
can be used for cancer care some amazing

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,669
results from that there's a stack of

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,289
research papers I can share that really

00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:17,519
showing the benefits there but also its

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,859
use for things like perfumes and

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,260
well-being and and actually the wood

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,719
itself is used for decoration but at the

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,340
moment that's an illegal trade of the

00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,420
whole industries ten to twenty billion

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,130
dollars a year

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,050
at the moment of that 50% is illegal

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,270
people are learning a fraction of what

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,410
they're worth at the bottom line and so

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,060
if you look at that all the way along

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,360
the supply chain can't see a better

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,010
application of blockchain and also it

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,480
says there food fraud again another

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,450
massive problem and people are losing

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,620
out at every stage so I mentioned

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,030
earlier about the sustainable

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,010
development goal something incredibly

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,200
close to my heart and I'm a co-chair of

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,120
something called frontier 3000 that's

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,680
coming out of the UN it's encouraging

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,840
more inclusion and diversity but also

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,700
scaling up social impact projects across

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,740
the world that's all I was doing there

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,360
the other week and as part of that I've

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,600
got a particular focus around supply

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,520
chains looking at transparency looking

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,930
at things around trade and how we can

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,610
make that right for all parties that are

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,410
involved and also looking things that

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,630
have making things truly accountable and

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,400
traceable again blockchain but also an

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,620
integration with other technologies it's

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,830
a fantastic way to do that every stage

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,680
across the line now on to technology we

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,840
have problems across the world in

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,310
certain areas one of which is inclusion

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,110
and diversity if we're creating

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,940
technology particularly AI we were

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,860
talking about just then we need to have

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,390
truly diverse teams and that's not just

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,850
about gender that's about all different

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,440
types of diversity and we need to do

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,420
more in that area that's particularly

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,980
prevalent around AI developments and

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,560
also areas such as blockchain and

00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,900
cybersecurity we need to look at areas

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,400
like interoperate interpreted if I can

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,090
even say that word interoperability

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,150
sorry

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,230
and also things around silos thinking we

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,450
don't have enough joined-up approach

00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,530
there's a classic across the world to be

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,300
honest with you we always have this

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,670
issue where people do not share there's

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,290
a voidance as negation of sharing is

00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,360
what part of my master's degree was

00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,620
about that particular area and I'm all

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,770
about creating this ethos of

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,850
collaboration also persistent

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,560
infrastructure challenges I think

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,630
developing world is a great example of

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,610
that so as a project I was involved in

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,530
around literacy and what we did was we

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,510
harnessed and repurpose the power of

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,310
older phones so you can use the power of

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,230
the cloud there to create this this

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,640
wonderful thing really of mentoring in

00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,740
families you have great problems

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,600
sometimes where mums and dads might not

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,670
have reading skills and that has that

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,560
problem later on down the line about how

00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,080
then do you help people to learn to read

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,220
and write and there can be a lot of

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,420
resistance to changes but it's quite a

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,870
difficult thing to talk about and that

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,250
and that could be very very hard

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,110
you can use the power of an old phone

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,580
you don't even need the internet you can

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,900
actually make a massive difference there

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,010
so a lot of what I do as well it's not

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,960
just about the really advanced stuff

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,690
it's also about repurposing older

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,460
technology as well and also as I said at

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,280
the beginning I'm all about sustainable

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,570
environmental and economic impact we've

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
talked about blockchain we have to then

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,510
acknowledge things like mining costs

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,460
you can't just sweep that under the

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,320
carpet and also things obviously around

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,820
scalability and performance but with

00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,410
some of the projects I'm working on and

00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,060
some of the newer kind of flavors of

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,680
blockchain for want of a better word are

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,020
actually dealing with that head-on so

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,430
that is not a panacea problem there are

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,480
significant developments are more and

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,380
happy to talk about some of those

00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,580
offline after the talk as well and just

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,140
for anybody who's not aware of them that

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,450
was just a quick flash picture there of

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,830
the SDGs the project I'm working on most

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,390
closely at the moment is called Sachs

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,160
which is called a sustainable asset

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,110
exchange and that's all around for

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,420
example ethical minerals but supply

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,430
ethical diamonds food

00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,260
and also bamboo is a replacement for

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,060
Platts plastic and how you can trade

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,620
that fairly and use blockchain

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,080
technology but also along things like

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,820
RFID and other forms of technology every

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,150
stage of the supply chain and it's all

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,640
about this next slide creating a triple

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,960
bottom line so for me that sustainable

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,540
development in the middle or another

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,550
word putting this a shared value we can

00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,890
bring economic social and environmental

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,870
benefits together it doesn't have to be

00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,460
an either/or sometimes I find that we

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,290
talk about one thing or the other we

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,790
never look enough about how we can

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,710
integrate them and that's what I

00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,720
passionately believe him and we are

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,520
seeing some early benefits as well

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,620
there's research from Stanford for

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,290
example there's looked at a number of

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,640
early blockchain projects and again I'm

00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,140
more than happy to share the research on

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,290
that and I've also got my own original

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,370
research in there as part of my PhD so

00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,080
we've got a lot of impact they're

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,970
showing a different scales where we're

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,740
actually seeing tangible benefits I've

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,910
also built my own measure because one of

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,100
the things you always find with social

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,420
impact how do you measure it you know

00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,490
even when you go for funding bids it's

00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,110
very difficult it can't just be anecdote

00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,910
or experience led we need some

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,290
quantitative measures as well so again

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,820
if anybody's interested in that side of

00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,320
things and how you harness the emergent

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,880
technology and the impact and draw them

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,980
together more and happy to share that

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,460
with you offline but we are starting to

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,590
see this coming through three-way

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,310
opportunity for change so moving on to

00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,830
the enable

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,600
side.now in in depth so for me this is

00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,860
all about technology convergence the two

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,080
talks we've had here this morning

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,820
blockchain and AI for me bringing those

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,410
things together has got the biggest

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,190
potential over all the projects I'm

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,740
working on

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,020
tend to have that a previous one was one

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,700
in the precision medicine field and that

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,800
was bringing together blockchain secure

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,990
DNA transfer alongside

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,820
AI machine learning for deep delve into

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,330
looking at pattern recognition so things

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,500
like population disease management and

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,240
within that we've got things coming

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,460
through you know blockchain as a service

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,380
but also science and technology coming

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,960
together that convergence there gain

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:36,130
massive catalyst for change and driving

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,839
social impact so this is a supply chain

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,180
that it's very close to heart so I've

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,339
just come back from a week or so in

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,020
Thailand and Malaysia you leave your

00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:45,670
CSUN photos of this later on but this is

00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,529
taking you for every stage because I do

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,180
find making this tangible is so

00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,680
important it needs to be accessible and

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,240
in groups like this where we've got a

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,230
great depth of knowledge on the

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,970
technical side of things that's

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,100
fantastic but sometimes when you're

00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,600
going broader than that we need to make

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,280
this like the phone in your pocket

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,990
things like blockchain AI machine

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,910
learning there's so much hype around

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,250
them but there's so much ambiguity as

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,510
well it's not always accessible it feels

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,550
like it's something out there unless

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,800
you're very very within the field so

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,870
again and the rune website I've gotten

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,670
the book etc it's all about tangible use

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,839
cases across every different sectors

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,460
there's something that you can look out

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,380
there and take it away and you feel that

00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,670
you can understand it this is what I'm

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,170
doing at the moment as you can see there

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,240
literally from the nursery to the end

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,550
consumer we've got technology at every

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,130
stage it's also a great example of the

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,960
fact that you can transition it doesn't

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,100
have to be a brand new bleeding edge

00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,810
like where are we going to use

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,280
blockchain where where's that a natural

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,390
fit actually there's a lot of businesses

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,400
where you can integrate this as a

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,750
natural revolution it doesn't have to be

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,700
something that's taking away jobs either

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,630
a bit like the talk just now it can be

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,940
taking away some of the more mundane

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,410
features and allowing much more quality

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:52,839
time to do work that's more fulfilling

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:54,459
and satisfying and this also gives an

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,760
opportunity as well to evolve our

00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:59,350
business models so as an example here as

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,029
part of the profit that's created from

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,520
this particular organization some of

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:04,510
that is put back at least 1% for example

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,790
from certain things that's happened

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,990
recently and this is a wonderful example

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,450
absolutely love this is he

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,890
bamboos bicycles bamboo I think this

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,480
going so much coming up with bamboo in

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,310
the next few months I'm there's more I

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,020
want to share on this but let's just say

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,730
is it sustainable replacement for

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,890
plastic but also in conjunction with

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,140
things like 3d printing modular homes

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,700
putting the furniture into that if you

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,830
look at things like the refugee crisis

00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,120
and also homelessness I'm directly

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,920
involved in projects there where we're

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,810
going to be using some of this bamboo in

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,520
really exciting ways and this is a

00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,839
three-way business model you can create

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,670
the really high spec bikes

00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:38,589
sell them overseas and make you know

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,180
earn money from that plough that back in

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:41,760
to the local community so we've got

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,140
hectares of land in Kenya as an example

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,120
helping kids connect the ten kilometers

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,860
to go to school and then really plowing

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,470
that back into community education so

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,220
that I very close to heart and it really

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,690
really excites me and this is kind of

00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,640
kind of into what I was saying just now

00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,500
we need to make the application of

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,209
advanced technology accessible to all

00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,860
and make it feel like this is something

00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:05,050
that's valuable and relevant to our

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,730
everyday life not something out here

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,709
just for the few we need to bring it

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,270
back in so what I do online I've got a

00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:12,279
new tech column that starts this week as

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,050
well there's very blockchain focus and

00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,970
stuff I do in Forbes as well but it's

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,760
all about making this tangible real

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,920
world relevant to everyone not just one

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,329
or two and particularly about looking at

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,910
really innovative ways how we can bring

00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,709
profit and purpose together not being a

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,810
juxtaposition how we can really create

00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:31,500
shared value and to do that as well

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,970
bringing together research high tech

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,329
people in the field like we got here but

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:39,010
also civil society NGOs the UN we need

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,470
to have this cross fertilization of

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,270
ideas rather than events are focused on

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,110
one or the other it's really about this

00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,940
intersection and again addressing non

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,310
advanced tech issues so in the case of

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,329
blockchain things around working with

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,920
telephone companies I've got a

00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:55,839
background with our engineering

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
companies like that and again we're

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,200
working with partnerships there to solve

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,730
some of those because we've got you

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,709
can't have the best ideas in the world

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,240
the most advanced forms of technology if

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:05,950
we haven't got the basic infrastructure

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,250
right we won't get to that point of

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:11,490
acceleration and again as I said the

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,649
collaborative ecosystems have changed

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,300
those are some pictures with me at the

00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:17,680
bottom there that was in Thailand and

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,020
again I do think sometimes a picture

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,820
says a thousand words and the heart of

00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,430
technology the human side of taken

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,900
oh gee the keynote so I do increasing at

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,400
the moment I'm really trying to stress

00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,140
that area because again I don't think

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,030
it's talked about enough we need to

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,620
really be a vaca see if we need to get

00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,630
people engaged we want people to be part

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,340
of this again you know the things around

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,110
stem and steam drop off at schools if

00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,030
you've got more excitement and

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,310
engagement about what is possible not

00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,390
what tech will just take away I think we

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,240
can really start to change the

00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:49,060
conversation there and on that note I'm

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,920
just going to give little notes three

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,050
pillars of change as I call that so this

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,670
is aspirational futures so this is I've

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,110
been doing this for kind of six to seven

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,460
years now in different projects in

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,010
different countries particularly

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,550
specializing in developing areas such as

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:05,830
Mexico Brazil and also but also back in

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,450
in other areas as well in many UK cities

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,970
as an example you can have a real

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,710
difference in open access to opportunity

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,540
it can be chalk and cheese one end of a

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,290
city to another I particularly love work

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,330
in Monterrey

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,700
an incredible incredible city the

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,220
richest city in Mexico but again full of

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,240
juxtaposition at once I'd travel 20

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,010
minutes and you probably looks like

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,900
you're going back 60 years you've gone

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,720
from Nina the heart of modern

00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:30,610
civilization to you know horton horse

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,080
and cart and Garda Seville Peabody's

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,030
were being dumped on the streets because

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,860
of the problems around drug abuse and

00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,540
you've got that real cycle of people

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,160
being trapped in in difficult areas and

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,230
we went out there helped build a new

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,970
school build it we like kind of robotics

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,310
projects Raspberry Pi all that kind of

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,200
stuff but also things like arts and and

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,120
you know jewelry making things like that

00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,730
so people can be truly creative because

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,620
we can't have the most creative minds of

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,210
the future building emergent tech if

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,280
we're not sparking that creativity in

00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,720
the first place we need arts and tech to

00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,780
be hand-in-hand so that's what

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,550
aspirational futures about scaling

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,230
access to opportunity so again as free

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,180
to access courses that I've built around

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,650
blockchain AI and other forms of

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,150
technology as well that are free for

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,180
people to use kinda like the mooc style

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:15,040
of things but open to all and a range of

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,080
tech4good projects that we're scaling up

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,550
across the globe so if anybody wants to

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,980
get involved in that just give me a

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,570
shout because I yeah an incredibly

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,640
passionate about it and it's all about

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,080
getting that scaled up ecosystem and

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,910
bringing everybody together to make that

00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,590
happen some of the people that have been

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,290
helping on that and it getting involved

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:34,210
on this little sheet there so again as

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,410
it kind of shows there this is very

00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,269
cross-sectoral

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,910
got big tech companies involved but also

00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:42,639
leading educational providers front

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:45,220
sorry frontier tech organizations from

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,839
the end UN but also things that are

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,669
specialists in certain areas opening up

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,229
access to labs for example well we're

00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:52,659
doing some fantastic work in that but

00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:54,339
I'm speaking about and by next week and

00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:56,619
there sometimes you know expect the

00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:58,209
unexpected there are places I've been

00:15:56,619 --> 00:16:02,049
and if you challenge your assumptions

00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:04,449
and you go in fresh full of enthusiasm

00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:06,399
full of that ethos of sharing and coming

00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:07,899
together I've been absolutely amazed

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,759
about what you can achieve and what you

00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:11,439
can contribute so my vision is all about

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,419
bringing as many people on board as that

00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:15,459
as possible basically and that's what I

00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,679
want to take the opportunity for on the

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,899
platform today as I finally kind of

00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,599
bringing that to a close if you're

00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:24,789
interested more about what I do in terms

00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:26,349
of the social media side of things again

00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:27,579
I love taking conversations on and

00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:29,379
offline and bringing these things

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:31,209
together so I'm very active pretty much

00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:32,499
everywhere on social media everything by

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:35,499
my name because I really believe in

00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:36,759
authenticity so Sally Yves I've also got

00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:39,279
a TEDx talk there's all around

00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,989
technology for good so tech for good is

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,579
kind of my mantra really so is all about

00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:44,409
the scaling up of that so feel free to

00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:46,659
have a look at that but yeah my message

00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,609
is that we need to all work together to

00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:50,559
really scale up change to share

00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:53,409
knowledge it's accurate and accessible

00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,939
and tangible for everybody and to do

00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:56,799
that so that's that's my kind of Korean

00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:58,149
call really and if anybody wants to talk

00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,769
to me about more detail about that I'll

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,449
be around all day and I'm more than

00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:06,149
happy to look at ways to work together

00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:06,149
