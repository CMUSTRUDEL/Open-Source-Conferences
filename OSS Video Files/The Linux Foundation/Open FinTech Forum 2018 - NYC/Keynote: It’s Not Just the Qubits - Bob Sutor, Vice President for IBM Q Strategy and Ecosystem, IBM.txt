I know some of you weren't born in 1982

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,870
okay but I started young alright so as

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,269
you can see they say for some weird

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,190
reason left out the very important term

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,949
quantum computing from the title of this

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,880
conference so I just got rid of all the

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,930
rest of them anyway quantum computing

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,510
it's one of these really really

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,949
interesting things lately and about

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,390
three-quarters of the things you're

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,870
gonna read about it in the media are

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,610
really wrong alright and so as we go

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,200
along here I'm gonna try to tell you

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,440
about the state of the state at least

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,090
from from our perspective but also kind

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,250
of tell you things never to say out loud

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,840
because ultimately we'll come back and

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,789
embarrass you okay when you actually

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,530
learn more all right

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,090
so think of that part as a public

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,879
service of what we're trying to do here

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,489
all right now even though there's some

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,199
FinTech conference when you're talking

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,170
about the motivation for quantum

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,899
computing you really can't get away from

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,479
chemistry this goes back to a conference

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,000
in 1981 where the physicist Richard

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,880
Feynman pointed out really that if

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,880
you're going to model nature that is

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,119
exactly represent natural processes in a

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,880
computer that a classical computer and a

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,320
classical computer is really anything

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,549
developed with the architecture starting

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,400
in the mid 1940s

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,340
so the Eenie acts all the way up to your

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,040
smartphone's right that there are gaps

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,970
in what you can actually compute there

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,939
right

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,860
there's no opera re reason to say just

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,930
because we have developed this

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,880
particular type of computer that it's

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,479
going to solve every single problem that

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,610
comes along now people have I think

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,880
gotten the wrong impression through the

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,049
years and through the decades because

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,149
computers just kept getting faster we

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,340
had Moore's laws at roughly every two

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,560
years they became twice as fast twice as

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,040
small they used half as much energy and

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,390
we became junkies right on on getting

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,060
this faster and we thought this would

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,580
always happen now depending on to whom

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,750
you speak Moore's law died ten years ago

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,959
or it's napping or whatever it's doing

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,170
but

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:20,310
that's almost kind of missing the point

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:23,519
in that in reality these types of

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,500
computers will not do for every type of

00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,719
problem and there are some mathematical

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,959
proofs for this right

00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,760
and so the work really began around 1981

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,500
and when when Fineman pointed out he

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,329
said well since nature and here we mean

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,750
basically atoms molecules and and

00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:44,579
particles below that is based on quantum

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,669
mechanics something which goes back to

00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:50,129
the 1900s really 1920 roediger

00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:53,989
heisenberg and so forth if you build a

00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:58,169
computer with a fundamental gate set

00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:00,359
that responds the way quantum mechanics

00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:03,329
responds and so here we are not talking

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:05,340
about bits and ands and ORS and nots and

00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:07,169
then as we build those up into adders

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,840
and multipliers and subtractors and

00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:12,629
eventually you get to Python right we're

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,639
not talking about that right at the

00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:20,819
lowest possible level it's different the

00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:25,440
best classical software engineer in the

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:27,720
world is not the best quantum programmer

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,569
in the world it's a completely different

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,489
thing so as if aliens came down and said

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,459
hey we developed this completely

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,750
different type of computer based on

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,569
absolutely different principles here it

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,680
is good luck figure it out ok and that's

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,949
where we are and that's what we're

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,590
figuring out what quantum computing will

00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:49,680
be good for and we're very early so as

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,359
just a very quick example I this is the

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,129
caffeine molecule if you were represent

00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:58,650
so from a quantum chemistry perspective

00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,870
the ground state energies right so you

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,819
think of atoms you have neutrons you

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,239
have protons but more important you have

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:09,720
electrons right and these exist in this

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,269
probabilistic cloud around the molecules

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,549
and if you were to write down saying how

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,820
much information is expressed in a

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:20,699
single molecule at a single instant with

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,070
respect to this energy configuration it

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,719
turns out that the number of bits zeros

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,180
and ones you'd need to represent that

00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:32,320
it's 10 to the 48th

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,860
yeah how does nature do that we don't

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,350
know

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,820
okay people have started religions over

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,750
trying to figure out how quantum

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,100
mechanics works right it's weird the

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,110
number of atoms and the earth are

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,750
estimated to be between 10 to the 49th

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,500
and 10 to the 50th so worst case the

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:54,280
number of bits you need is comparable to

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,639
10% of the size of the earth well that's

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,260
different right now if we think about

00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,470
qubits and I'll talk a little bit more

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,840
about qubits here quantum bits when a

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,800
quantum computer with a hundred and

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,570
sixty of these qubits right is running

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,419
you could store that amount of

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,740
information I'm completely skipping over

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,139
how you get all that information in

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,110
there okay I'm completely skipping over

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,639
and then what do you want to do okay but

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,509
just to give you an idea that

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:30,430
classically completely impossible to

00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:33,130
exactly represent we at IBM have our

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,050
largest quantum computers 50 cubits it's

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,300
reasonable to think you know progress

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,780
the next few years will get 260 and

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,020
beyond

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,510
and so there's hope here all right so

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,300
first thing right as I said before what

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:49,979
things don't say never say quantum

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:54,190
computing will because we don't know

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:56,440
there is real science theoretical

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,979
physics theoretical mathematics that has

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,599
to be developed and you can't just toss

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,550
it off and say oh well smart people will

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:07,479
figure it out bla bla bla really it'll

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,300
be four years right no no right there

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,789
gonna be a lot of extremely important

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,460
scientific milestones from here to

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,620
wherever you want to be where frankly we

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,720
don't know how to do it we have ideas

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,760
about getting from here to there let's

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,060
say but we know that there have to be

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,030
major breakthroughs so when people say

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,340
something will definitely happen in five

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,440
years do not believe them because

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,690
probably they're not actually building

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,630
quantum computers and don't know the

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,140
actual issues a lot of times people will

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,820
say especially about crypto

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,740
the number of wrong things that people

00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,110
say about quantum and crypto right

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,900
quantum will break cryptography next

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:53,500
Tuesday at 3 o'clock right like quantum

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,030
apocalypse is coming the largest

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,700
computer we have right now as I said

00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,020
it's 50 cubits maybe others have

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,720
slightly more I don't know if there's

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,000
work but whatever the number of qubits

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,610
we're going to need to break the types

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,250
of encryption such as an RSA is on the

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:14,080
order of 100 million we have 50 all

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,370
right sleep well this weekend if you're

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,450
in security okay all right now

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,780
breakthroughs may happen but it's not

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:27,850
Tuesday ok right all right

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:30,700
so therefore motivated by chemistry by

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,860
this example chemistry is an area where

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,960
there's likely to be some early

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,930
breakthroughs and we've seen some good

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,120
algorithmic matchups to certain problems

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,910
we had an article a year ago September

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,940
on the cover of nature material design

00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:49,120
is an area particularly types particular

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:54,190
types of materials oil and gas midterm

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:57,790
so we usually say near-term is in up

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:59,200
until the end of the 2020s and if we're

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,990
really optimistic we'll say three to

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,580
five years okay so just to give me an

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:10,450
idea so so chemistry you know mid 2020s

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:13,540
drug discovery much later much later you

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:16,419
need very large quantum computers if we

00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,250
can build them if right we might if

00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,669
possibly these are all important words

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,700
here

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:24,550
artificial intelligence two possible

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,160
areas one we use quantum computing to

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,740
speed up the low-level math we do

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,880
particularly linear algebra somehow some

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,250
way right except quantum computers are

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,320
not big data machines you cannot push a

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,469
lot of information into a quantum

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,180
computer right so therefore you have to

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:46,030
reduce the size of the problem something

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,890
which you do classically right and so it

00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,440
raises questions what does sketching

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,990
mean for input to a quantum calculation

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,710
so that's kind of scattering a result

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,630
the

00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,220
other area which to me is frankly a

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,040
little bit more interesting is to say or

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,440
they're completely new algorithms that

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,570
take advantage of quantum computing such

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,390
as entanglement right fundamental

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,850
principles of the programming model that

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,830
somehow maps to something about the data

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,890
that allows you to do let's say

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:18,370
classification much more efficiently and

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:21,820
then financial services here you know

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,770
this is kind of a topic people are

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,520
figuring this out it's happening a

00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:29,589
little slowly the big houses the hedge

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,620
funds have people who are working on

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:34,330
this traditionally they're physicists

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,279
who can code they know a lot of math

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,250
they're trying to understand how these

00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,380
certain types of algorithms will match

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,870
we think it's going to be the first

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,060
areas of interest will be replacements

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:51,760
for Montecarlo sorts of simulations

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:53,410
that's for for risk analysis with

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,540
quantum computers and again we've only

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,790
done very small problems this is for

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:03,820
very small problems but it's it's a nice

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:05,890
paper says that essentially you can do

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,620
your simulation because you can work

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,630
with much smaller sample sets on the

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,580
order of you know quadratic you know

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,290
square root of what you have and oh by

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,660
the way the samples you're taking or

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,430
higher quality right so that's that

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,920
that's the name of the game there so I

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,560
encourage you to to look at things like

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,080
this all right

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,240
quantum advantage is a period and this

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:33,000
is what I talked about before the 2020s

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,800
saying okay right over here in this area

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,650
we can show that quantum computing is

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,500
significantly faster than anything we

00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,529
can do using classical methods classical

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,529
algorithms on a classical computer

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:49,209
anything we know how to do which isn't

00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,000
to say somebody can't figure out

00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:54,100
something and be really smart and come

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,240
up with faster classical methods right I

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,339
mean you know that I mean that's what

00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,480
algorithm people do so there's a race

00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:04,000
here right but in any case the point is

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,880
is that the future is a hybrid we are

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,760
not going to be replacing the current

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,130
classical

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,660
appears with quantum ones except maybe

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:15,200
in like 200 years

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,170
right there glacially slow for

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,880
traditional computing things and

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:23,360
ridiculously fast for a special class of

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,940
problems right and so the mix is how do

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,010
you combine those two things right how

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,730
do you maybe rethink your whole attack

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:33,890
on on a certain problem so when I say

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:37,100
significant advantage I mean like a

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:39,260
thousand times better not twice as good

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,090
you know what you don't you want to run

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,790
something you know run it twice as long

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,800
right big deal right I mean everybody

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,580
has hardware clouds whatever you've got

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,650
here right so so that's that's what

00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,740
we're looking for right this quantum

00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:57,080
advantage and it will we're looking for

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,900
it in all those fields I mentioned and

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,090
several others as well and also if you

00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,100
get down into some of the algorithms for

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:07,700
some of the areas I mentioned those

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,170
things can be can be used elsewhere as

00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,980
well so that's just a subset of

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,900
industries and I think especially some

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,860
of the things that will be used early on

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,990
just for hedge funds and and portfolio

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:26,350
analysis and so forth is very broadly

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:29,570
used in many many different places okay

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:33,950
if you're not gonna let me use any math

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:36,970
I and no one else are gonna give you a

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:39,440
good explanation of what a qubit is okay

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,890
there are you know there's the spinning

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:47,450
doughnut family of explaining what what

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:49,430
a qubit is literally a doughnut the

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,220
spinning coin right all sorts of things

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:55,970
like this here's something else not to

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:59,390
say never say a qubit is 0 1 1 at the

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:01,940
same time people love this expression

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,680
and for those of you who know some math

00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,680
it's because these people have never

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,770
heard of a linear combination right it's

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,870
like saying go three blocks north right

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,760
and four blocks east and being so

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,120
excited you're north and east at the

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,880
same time right so all we're basically

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,710
saying here right is instead of this

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,210
kind of

00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:26,880
Oh dimensional situation where you have

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:29,260
two points zero and one really the the

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,680
computational space for a given qubit is

00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:36,430
in fact two-dimensional and here this is

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,080
called a block sphere be LOC H that two

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,530
dimensions is wrapped around the surface

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,690
of a sphere and we will arbitrarily

00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:45,640
label the North Pole as zero and the

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,600
South Pole is one they're just labels

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,630
they're not numbers right and so when a

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,400
qubit is operating the value it can take

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,410
on can be anywhere on the surface of

00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,200
that sphere but the end of the

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:02,320
calculation when we poke it and we

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:06,730
measure it it must collapse to zero or

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,340
one where does it go well think of the

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,230
positions in some sense of you know

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,620
where it fits particularly vertically as

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,410
the probability of where it will go to

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,420
zero or one see quantum computing

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:23,290
because based on quantum mechanics is

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:27,210
probabilistic and so these numbers over

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:29,890
here right in this simple case actually

00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:31,840
when you you you take the absolute value

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,630
and square them actually represent

00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,370
probabilities so what you've got to know

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,350
when you really start getting into this

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,570
right if you want to completely ignore

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,700
the physics you have to know about five

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,560
minutes worth of probability you have to

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,690
know a couple of hours worth of complex

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,400
numbers and then you probably need to

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,680
know a little bit more about linear

00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,530
algebra and that's the basis for the

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,770
mathematical treatment of quantum

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:59,440
computing right from there on so if we

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,120
start here right we can say a qubit is a

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,420
linear combination of these two things

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,180
we'll just arbitrarily labels yeren one

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,270
and what's even cooler is that a and B

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,890
are complex numbers they're not integers

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,650
they're not real numbers are complex

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:17,170
numbers and that affects the mathematics

00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,180
tremendously and gives you know

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:23,740
basically birth to two why all this

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:27,610
works so when we add one more qubit we

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:30,100
double the power so this is a

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:34,060
traditional computer it's a power nine

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,490
core moore's law you want the computer

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,350
twice

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,149
as fast twice as powerful double the

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,450
number of transistors roughly speaking

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:43,910
you had one more qubit it is not trivial

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:47,870
though in all times to just add one more

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:51,399
qubit right if I this this is a 16-bit

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:55,940
qubit device if I program this one and

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:58,130
you do this via microwave pulses right

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,649
if I'm sending a pulse down to program

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,589
this is the ringing of the pulse

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:06,200
actually affecting nearby qubits so

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,149
there are all sorts of problems of how

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,920
they're close together and the intensity

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:12,890
of the pulse and the size of the pulse

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,640
and things like this right so quantum

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:18,770
computing is in many ways even beyond

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,870
the simple semiconductor where you get

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,600
noise and crosstalk even more

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,459
complicated because these qubits really

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,860
are dying to entangle themselves with

00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:32,149
each other in ways beyond classical

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:34,100
computers do so exponential growth this

00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:36,740
conference I don't have to tell you what

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,380
that means right I will tell you though

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,470
Americans in general think exponential

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:46,490
means really really fast and that's the

00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:50,870
sum total right one qubit we get these

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:53,540
two basis States a and B two qubits we

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,370
get four basis states think of it as

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,440
four pieces of information meaning the

00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,740
coefficients and their complex numbers

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,470
right so two qubits I can hold four

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,199
pieces of information and because it's

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:09,290
exponential with three qubits I hold

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:12,350
eight and now we're getting interesting

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:15,500
right now the growth is is certainly not

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:18,709
linear here and so with n qubits we have

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,959
two to the n coefficients to the end

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:24,679
these pieces of information and that

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,829
goes back to caffeine and Y with 160

00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:30,130
qubits we can represent that information

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:32,300
right that's how it works

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:36,440
mathematicians it's a tensor product

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,179
right all right the largest computer we

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,960
have is to the fiftieth as I mentioned

00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:43,820
this is how many pieces of information

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,110
it could store while it is running

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,650
that's very important not while at rest

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,810
and that

00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:54,530
the computational space it can work with

00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:58,130
right so it's problems that would tend

00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:00,770
to explode right exponentially inside a

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,890
classical computation this meant that

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,440
this may be suitable for not problems

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,360
that have a million pieces of data but

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,910
things that you can represent and once

00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,740
you start computing with just blow up on

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:17,440
you that's where you look for to see if

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:22,100
quantum computing might be useful to you

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,950
if we get to 275 qubits the amount of

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,680
information is larger than the number of

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,450
atoms in the observable universe and we

00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,970
hope in 10 years time this will be

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,390
considered a small computer how does it

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,360
work

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,430
we don't know okay that's your weekend

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,640
reading you know the philosophy of

00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,590
quantum mechanics so it gets strange but

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,420
it's also fascinating from so many

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,270
different reasons these are the two

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,190
principles I talked about superposition

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,980
in several ways I talked about it on the

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,590
surface of the sphere what that means

00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:57,410
and also as you get this

00:18:54,590 --> 00:19:00,740
exponential blow-up here as well

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:04,250
entanglement says that two particles

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,780
wherever they are are so correlated when

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,630
you know about one of them you know

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,880
about the other one Einstein hated this

00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,670
he called it spooky action at a distance

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,740
he really tried to prove it didn't work

00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,930
he helped proved this is the way it

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,220
actually works he wasn't always right

00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:25,670
now going to the title please stop

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:30,380
counting qubits all right if you have

00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:33,800
four thousand really lousy qubits it is

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:36,890
not better than having 50 really good

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:40,370
qubits for lots of reasons it's a

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:43,250
multi-dimensional measurement on the

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,540
quality of a set of qubits and how many

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,250
things you can do with them

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,930
right and so here are some of the

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:52,250
factors the number of physical qubits

00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:54,230
the connectivity what gates can you put

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,790
in this the errors the errors on the

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,740
individual qubits the errors on the

00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,940
connections of the qubits decoherence

00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,290
and things like this so you know

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,030
when someone says I have more cubits

00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:08,360
than you ask how many of them actually

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:11,930
work right or how many are usable then

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,500
they usually shut up after this okay

00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:18,800
so some numbers here Shores this is our

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,240
10 million right number 4 here it's

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,570
going to play out this is gonna be a

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,000
multi-decade sort of thing I think

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:29,570
probably it will be the most significant

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,140
computing technology for this century as

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:35,540
it from from a core hardware perspective

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,940
all right this is what a quantum

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,950
computer looks like I'm finishing up

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,750
here let me just tell you that as we

00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,300
when we enclose this and cool it down

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:47,990
right down here at the bottom it

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:50,570
operates at 15 millikelvin it's close to

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,940
absolute zero the base of a quantum

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,370
computer is one of the coldest places in

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,400
the universe outer space is two point

00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:00,380
seven degrees Kelvin this is much colder

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,020
than outer space right and it's being

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:05,630
able to do this and keep it consistent

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:09,350
that is part of why we can even begin to

00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:13,400
build quantum computers all right we

00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:15,560
just passed the 100,000 user mark in the

00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,620
last 24 hours on the IBM Q experience

00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:21,140
you can go and play with a 5 and a 16

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,900
qubit real quantum computers for free

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,940
the IBM Q experience you can join these

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,360
other people there have been a hundred

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,760
and thirty papers it's actually up since

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,910
I wrote that six point seven million

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:41,690
calculations have been done all by non

00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:45,140
paying customers how uh Niger

00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,820
quisque it is the open source sdk

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,410
yes that's sort of why I'm here at this

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,920
conference right

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:54,230
it's a extends Python three it has

00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,760
several levels of programming below that

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,220
there is a quantum assembler language

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,500
and there is a microwave pulse open

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:05,390
pulse definition below that which is

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:08,000
opes also open source all right quiz get

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:11,000
alpha aqua excuse me you said libraries

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,310
on top of that quiz get tera a set of

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,210
open source libraries at the very lowest

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,040
level

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,630
why spend millions of dollars and build

00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,220
your own quantum computer when we will

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,410
let you program it at the lowest

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,790
possible level of the pulses okay so

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,540
with that there are lots of ways of

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,550
joining us

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,440
the IBM Q Network we bring in

00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:34,020
universities people can partner with us

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,670
these are the advanced machines these

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,670
are always going to be the top quality

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:42,030
machines the twenty cubits and beyond so

00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:45,090
with all of this to end this is what a

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,800
modern quantum computation Center looks

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,920
like that's in Yorktown Heights New York

00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,430
about 30 miles north of here this is not

00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:58,730
a lab experiment hundred thousand people

00:22:53,430 --> 00:23:01,260
right and this is what we're aiming for

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,360
so if you come visit me in a few months

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,070
you'll see one of these up at the IBM

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,940
Research Lab in your inten thank you

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,160
very much

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,160
