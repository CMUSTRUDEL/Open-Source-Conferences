Thank You Jamie and I'm really glad to

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,930
see this conference take off I you know

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,820
open Wall Street has been an early

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,469
adopter of all sorts of information

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,509
technologies that's that's an obvious

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,340
statement but open-source software has

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,529
been a big thing here for a long time -

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,279
I remember even in the late 90s lots of

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,070
pockets of people using Python using and

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,289
PHP and Apache and technologies and even

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,789
like the first Inklings of big data and

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,160
such and they wouldn't tell their bosses

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,390
they wouldn't tell anybody because it

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,740
was Wall Street and you didn't tell

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,870
anybody anything about how your

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,940
operations work and what's been nice to

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,610
see over the last 20 years is Wall

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,940
Street opening up and starting to

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,950
contribute code upstream to open source

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,620
projects and get official recognition

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,420
from their CIOs and CTOs and such that

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,530
not only is there a reason to use open

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,899
source software there's a reason to

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,730
contribute back so that's been really

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,370
great to see and one of those places

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,649
where this is manifested itself is not

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,140
just in kind of like the the standards

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,059
operating systems the cloud container it

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,189
cloud kind of movement that sort of

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,500
thing but in kind of new wave technology

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,000
kind of domains as well where things are

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,470
still being sorted out right and it's

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,270
not just the proprietary vendors

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,070
figuring this out it's open source

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,340
communities trying to make that happen -

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,259
so I so Wall Street has been a really

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,220
big part of the hyper ledger project for

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,530
a long time and they've been really

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,689
happy to see that and happy to see this

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,229
event covering all sorts of different

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,369
sides of the blockchain space as well

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,900
you've heard a bit about kind of the

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,960
crypto currency side and the public

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,460
ledger side and I wanted to talk more

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,890
today about what we're doing at hyper

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,310
litter on more of the enterprise side of

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,140
blockchain technology and all of you now

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,729
have probably also heard that at the

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,000
Linux Foundation there's a bit more than

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,009
just Linux going on I in fact the

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,590
template that the foundation had forged

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,600
around bringing together two layers of

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,460
community one layer being the software

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,920
developers giving them kind of a neutral

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,710
ground to work together and just enough

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,689
structure just enough bureaucracy to

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,430
make sure people are like maximally

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,350
efficient with their time and able to

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,440
ship software that enterprises can trust

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,819
right but not actually like doing the

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,340
software development ourselves instead

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,989
acting somewhat as air traffic control

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,640
and then the second layer being the

00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,159
commercial ecosystem on top right

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,260
bringing companies together to to help

00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,909
build their use of the technology and

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,500
how they explain that to their customers

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:31,409
right and in the blockchain space I what

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,849
what has started out perhaps as a you

00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,129
know kind of a move from talking about

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,560
purely the payment side and programmable

00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:39,090
money and people talking about the

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,439
blockchain if you ever hear somebody use

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,840
the definite article in front of the

00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,209
word blockchain I what they've missed

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,430
perhaps is that the way people are

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,040
rolling this stuff out now is as a lot

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,230
of different Ledger's that are specific

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,659
to a given community a community that

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,120
might be forged around a set of use

00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:01,260
cases and say the banking sector around

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,450
trade finance or around payments but it

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,549
could also be around a community of

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,760
organizations focused on healthcare a

00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:10,049
community of organizations focused on

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,109
the supply chain I'll talk about a

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,939
couple of examples that that are using

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,739
hyper ledger technology today but we're

00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,400
increasingly saying this kind of multi

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,109
Ledyard world and that if we do it wrong

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,400
that'll be a whole lot of different

00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:25,590
technologies a lot of bespoke

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,199
small-batch artisanal kind of block

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,209
chains out there that I end up being

00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,949
pretty complex to manage if we do it

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,449
right then we have a lot of common

00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:35,069
software underneath a lot of common

00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,299
protocols between those parties and

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,790
that's really what we're trying to build

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,310
at hyper litter is recognizing that

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,840
there are lots of different motives for

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,659
building these block chains building

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,900
these distributed systems and some of

00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,040
those drive architectural decisions that

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,229
lend themselves towards either

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,209
particular consensus mechanisms on a

00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:57,720
distributed ledger particular approaches

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,310
to smart contract languages some that

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,959
may need to be more locked down

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,629
because they're in a very regulated

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,479
space very where the cost of being wrong

00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:08,909
is very high others that are more opened

00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,689
up more participants on the network a

00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:14,400
lesser kind of regulatory or contractual

00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:16,470
relationship between the parties full

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,659
turing completeness is desired in the

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,970
smart contract system that sort of thing

00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,590
and so supporting that whole spectrum is

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,230
really i

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,419
where we we've we focused we like to

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,820
think of ourselves as a home for token

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,650
agnostic technologies right and that

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,870
ultimately what we come up with could be

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,460
used to build a very widespread payment

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,500
system but it could also be used to

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,419
build that network between five banks

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,889
that people want to see deploy how do we

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,960
support that full-spectrum and in a way

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,910
it's kind of like the the way that the

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,070
database world never really converged on

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:51,030
only one true database instead you have

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,310
my sequel and Cassandra and Berkeley DB

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,440
and all these other kind of like points

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,790
in the solution space and that probably

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,060
will be the same way for blockchain

00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,979
technology as well which is why at hyper

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,340
ledger rather than say hey there's one

00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,320
true architecture like actually frankly

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,120
you have in the Linux kernel right you

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,010
have Linda's Torvalds with a very strong

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,540
opinion and his lieutenants and and

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,550
other developers in that community

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,930
saying you know we will do a lot of

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,130
experimentation we'll try a lot of

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,010
things but ultimately we're going to

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,449
converge on on probably objectively the

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,820
right way to build a certain way

00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,680
approach to file system drivers to

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,810
process management that sort of thing

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,400
instead at hyper ledger we said this is

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,370
still a young space we still don't know

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,350
well what the what the solution space

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,479
looks like how continuous is it can it

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,130
be solved with one single architecture

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,900
or does it require things that are

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,450
semantically or conceptually as

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,180
different as my sequel and cassandra and

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,830
so we took very early on kind of a big

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,560
tent approach or as we've called it the

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,470
green house and now have ten different

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,620
projects within that green house all the

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,139
different stages of the move from pure

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,780
R&D project to to final finalized in

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,310
production two that are now in

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,470
production and being used in some pretty

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,830
fun places and I'll show that in a bit

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:10,889
are hyper ledger fabric and hyper ledger

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,330
Sawtooth and I'll go to the depth and

00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,870
more depth on what what they do in kind

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,490
of their differences in just a bit but

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,080
overall five of those 10 are what we're

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,510
calling frameworks and these are

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,430
technologies that if a group of you were

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,320
to go build a distributed ledger to

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,090
build a common system of record between

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,430
yourselves each of you would stand up a

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,990
node that you'd have control over and

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,060
that might be hosted in the cloud that

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,650
could be hosted with somebody providing

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,300
a blockchain as a service service right

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,069
or it could be on your own physic

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,349
hardware if you really wanted your hands

00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:43,319
around that but you'd stand up a node

00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:44,849
you'd point that node at a certificate

00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,259
authority which kind of acts like the

00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,819
referee on a football field

00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,970
you know they grant a certificate to

00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,949
participate in in that blockchain

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,440
network that would also point you to the

00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:57,210
other peers and you fire that up and run

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,710
and you start writing transactions and

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,590
confirming other people's transactions

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,449
in a way you go so that's what we're

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,800
calling a framework and today we have

00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,259
five different frameworks than hyper

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,930
ledger again to those fabric and

00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,219
sawtooth to others that are really

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,569
getting a lot of well actually the other

00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:14,520
three are all getting traction in

00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,620
different ways and and are specific in

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,139
ways indie is very focused on

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,419
distributed digital identity hyper

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,940
ledger borough is an implementation of

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:26,069
the etherium virtual machine and Aroha

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,069
is this kind of redheaded stepchild from

00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:31,740
Japan that is very focused on payments

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,940
and very focused on mobile and we're

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,460
still trying to figure out exactly the

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,319
right way to fit it in but we'll well go

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,300
into more depth on that in a bit and

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,190
then a whole bunch of tools that make

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,469
using these technologies better one

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,669
that's an authoring environment called

00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:46,199
hyper ledger composer

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:48,419
another that's kind of a cluster

00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,300
management tool called cello which is

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,849
being really oriented around kubernetes

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,979
using kubernetes as the deployment and

00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,750
management framework hyper ledger

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:00,870
Explorer which is about being able to

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,250
browse around your ledger and see how

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,810
these bits are connected and these

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,930
transactions are connected to each other

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:09,240
and then a performance package called

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,400
hyper ledger caliper which is about

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,840
trying to get to an apples-to-apples

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
comparison when you characterize the

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,009
performance of a given block chain

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,719
Network a whole lot of momentum has

00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,060
emerged in the almost three years that

00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:23,550
we've been around December 2015 was when

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,830
we were announced February 2016 is when

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,389
the first code dropped and in that time

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,539
I mean we I think we've done pretty well

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,620
in terms of building the broader

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:33,779
developer ecosystem and the broader

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,029
commercial ecosystem around hyper ledger

00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,949
we recently crossed 800 different

00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:40,709
contributors across those ten different

00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:42,390
projects some more than others some are

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:45,810
much more mature as projects than others

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:48,480
but all of them now all of the ones that

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,310
have gone to production are now at the

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,740
point where the contributor can be

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,940
is larger than just one vendor than just

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,320
one company and that's that's pretty

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,970
important because that's part of the

00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,160
reason we exist is to provide this kind

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,410
of multi-stakeholder framing around each

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,300
of our open-source projects lots of

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,950
activity out there and in kind of on the

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,050
international side as well blockchain

00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,180
technology is not being driven by

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,279
Silicon Valley as much as many of the

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,620
other technology movements so for us

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,350
it's been important to have active

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,540
meetup communities and software

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,930
development events like our hack fests

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:25,830
and and others in places like Singapore

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:27,930
and Beijing and and all over Europe and

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,820
and so the meetup communities are truly

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,839
global at this point and they're they're

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,360
getting together they're talking about

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,339
use cases they're also writing code we

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,350
also have had a lot of activity recently

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,390
in these working groups and working

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,010
groups for us some of them are are

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,710
cross-cutting and very technically

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,130
focused one on architecture for example

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,750
that has published a series of papers on

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,430
consensus mechanisms on smart contracts

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,339
that sort of thing to try to weave

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,570
together these five different frameworks

00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,390
that we have and is something that makes

00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,220
some sort of coherent kind of sense the

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,990
identity working group has also been

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,390
very active in trying to talk about how

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,600
do we reconcile blockchains with the GDP

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,010
our for example and then also some

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,420
sector specific working groups that

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,300
we've launched one around healthcare

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,550
which was an essential way to try to

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,110
reach a community that had lots of

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,300
questions about blockchain technology

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:22,080
and very little background or experience

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,760
in distributed systems and so trying to

00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,190
meet them where they are and talk about

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,780
use cases talk about constraints when

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,250
would you not use the blockchain right

00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,400
there's a lot of reasons not to use the

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,780
blockchain it's a very slow database but

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,550
to try to talk about where that would

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,620
wit make sense that community actually

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,000
said well let's pick a use case and

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,900
somebody said well we're in the breast

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,670
milk donor supply chain business and

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,500
there's some real problems with the way

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,720
things work today that maybe blockchain

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,760
technology might address that community

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,380
now has kind of spun up its own kind of

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,290
software development project around

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,820
implementing blockchain technology

00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,250
implementing hyper ledger for that use

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,560
case as a kind of public exposition of

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,450
how do we build a something like this

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,140
how do we marry the constraints of the

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,520
use kay

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,590
with the constraints of the technology

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,900
and figure out something interesting

00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,640
that's been really fun to watch but by

00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,200
and large lots of different fun activity

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,140
going on oh I should also mention the

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,360
membership base because like other Linux

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,920
Foundation projects where all of our

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,320
work is done publicly it's all open

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,630
source there's no special rights that

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,370
accrue to two members in terms of access

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,410
to code or participation in the

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,510
open-source project but we're supported

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:34,020
in our efforts by by our members right

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,340
and so we've grown from kind of the

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,090
companies you've heard of and expect

00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,560
companies like IBM and Intel inde TCC

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,180
which I'm sure many of you here I don't

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,770
nobody outside of Wall Street has heard

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,490
of DTCC and I think they prefer it that

00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:49,050
way but I really like them hi Rob and

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,340
you'll hear from junior from Rob

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,260
yesterday you'll hear from them they'll

00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,600
hook you're new today yeah good because

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,180
it's an awesome story but we've also

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,800
grown in the form of adding kind of

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,270
really talked to your participation from

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,150
healthcare companies companies like

00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:05,400
change healthcare who have a network in

00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,320
production today processing millions of

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,820
transactions a day which from you know

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,250
from a big data perspective it's still

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,460
small beans but these are transactions

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:17,460
that are have to do with flowing

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,290
healthcare insurance claims from AI from

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,890
from basically from clinics and doctors

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:25,140
to payers and back and change healthcare

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,120
as part of McKesson and they process

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:30,030
about two trillion dollars a year worth

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,530
of healthcare claims 80% of all

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,060
healthcare claims in the United States

00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,310
get touched by their system at one point

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,710
or another and so they're in production

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,420
with the network now but we've also

00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,820
added lots of other members lots of

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,130
geographic diversity to what we do by

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,680
the way in the last slide Baidu might

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,440
seem like an odd duck to be thereby do

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,380
that is actually doing a lot with

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,210
blockchain technology internally as well

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,910
as deploying a blockchain as a service

00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,650
offering and we're seeing 10 cents in

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,390
Alibaba all have also launched

00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:04,110
blockchain as a service cloud offerings

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,420
in China for for their supply chain

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,850
purposes and for others and companies

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,770
like Airbus and Daimler who are not

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,170
blockchain companies they're not even IT

00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,580
companies but who see that reinventing

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,430
their business at a pretty deep level

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,120
it's a really fun fun group of companies

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,589
and even abroad

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,630
general membership that represents

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:23,700
companies across finance across

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,440
healthcare and all sorts of different

00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,240
supply chain settings supply chain isn't

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,100
really a sector so much as something

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,020
every sector does so it's been really

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,490
fun to see that play out in all these

00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,100
areas in addition to building

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:39,630
relationships with lots of government

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:42,720
agencies nonprofits student associations

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,460
and other universities out there both

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,660
you know and these kinds of

00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,339
organizations don't support us

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,440
financially which is great the they

00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,720
support us in other ways we use these as

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,120
a lever to get out to their communities

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,339
as well when somebody like the produce

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,800
Marketing Association wants to talk with

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:01,500
us we're like why and it's because

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,330
everybody in the produce my shipping

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,790
business is talking about using

00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:08,430
blockchain technology as a way to keep

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,680
the next ecoli disaster from causing all

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,980
produce from California from being

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,440
banned you know for the entire US market

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,330
right so and blockchain technology

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,100
potentially plays a role in that sort of

00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,810
thing so let me talk about really

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,390
quickly about a couple of use cases that

00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:27,029
we've seen a hyper ledger in production

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,459
today serving real needs there's a

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:33,540
network that's been set up by Deutsche

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:36,540
Bank HSBC Santander Societe Generale a

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,720
lot of other large banks to manage the

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,970
flow of paper related to letters of

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,350
credit related to all the kinds of

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,839
bureaucracy and paperwork that gets

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,850
involved in getting a container of stuff

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,420
from one side of the world to the other

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:54,089
right nobody wants to send a bank wire

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,740
to and to an address and then not see

00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:57,720
their stuff actually get delivered so

00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,450
the financial world is set up all sorts

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,480
of intermediaries and guarantees and

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,430
insurers and export-import banks and all

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,339
this infrastructure to deal with a low

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,350
trust environment when something like

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,510
blockchain technology can really step in

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,550
and cut a lot of the complexity and a

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,850
lot of the different layers down to just

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,950
a few and so this network is about those

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,810
banks helping their member accounts

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,850
their member companies small and

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,890
mid-sized businesses predominantly get

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,510
easier access to credit established

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,820
their history as a good trading partner

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:32,520
much more efficiently and cut the time

00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,870
to issue a lot of this paperwork in docq

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,350
and believe it or not the cost of

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:40,020
sending a container from one part from

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,660
Shanghai to Los Angeles half that cost

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,190
is in the paperwork and so if projects

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,530
like this especially if they start to

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,450
involve port authorities and and export

00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,220
authorities and such in the in the

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,630
managing that flow could do a lot to get

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,500
the cost of shipping goods around the

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:58,440
world similarly in the in the when it

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,300
comes to food there's a project that IBM

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,430
and Walmart and a couple of other

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,720
anchors have established it's now in

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,120
production it's called the food trust

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,200
network initially it's focused on leafy

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,670
greens but and and the kind of domestic

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,380
supply chain around that in the United

00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,020
States Walmart actually had just

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,940
announced that they will be requiring

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,670
all of their suppliers their Tier one

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,710
suppliers around leafy greens to all of

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,620
their stores to be on this network next

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,690
year and by 2020 they think that goes

00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,720
well the require the next year beyond

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,060
now if it was just focused on Walmart

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,140
then it would just be a Walmart API and

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,000
you could just build it as a Walmart

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,820
central database but even Walmart

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,190
doesn't have the market strength to be

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,540
able to say you know we want this all to

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,830
be centralized on us well they would

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,170
perhaps like that like any business

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,270
would but that wouldn't carry the enough

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,310
weight with the rest of the ecosystem to

00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:53,280
make sense instead Walmart is setting

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,900
this up in again with IBM and others and

00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,010
they're inviting other retailers to be a

00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,570
part of that they're inviting their

00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,960
competitors to be a part of that because

00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:03,000
that increases the value for for

00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,800
everybody in that ecosystem and and

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,360
ultimately the governance organization

00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,520
behind that will have to reflect that

00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,890
kind of diversity be interesting to see

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,270
where that goes and in China there's

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,950
some really big deployments that have

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,620
been done in kind of almost without our

00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:19,260
awareness or knowledge there's a bank

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,900
called China min Qiang Bank that has

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,210
driven the deployment with about a dozen

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,270
other large banks in China including

00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:30,240
siddik which is perhaps the one that

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:33,420
that you've you've heard of to also

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,950
process domestic letters of credit which

00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,390
are basically debt right corporate debt

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,820
their first day that they launched this

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,350
in production they processed a hundred

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,340
million remin B which is about sixteen

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,590
million dollars

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,390
u.s. dollars worth of letters of credit

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,790
issuance and there now to up to a couple

00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,340
hundred million renminbi per day this is

00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:56,050
a market that that you know worldwide

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,620
processes a couple trillion dollars a

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:01,540
day us so this is still kind of a just a

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,670
small segment of it but but pretty

00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,250
exciting and that's on fabric now and in

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,780
production likewise there's another

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:11,470
project that's a startup they're based

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:13,180
in China that is built a legal documents

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,830
blockchain for a number of these

00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,360
internet courts that have been set up in

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,530
China

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,140
these are courts where you can appear

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:22,710
present evidence talk to a jury and then

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,990
get your case resolved entirely online

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,880
and there's reasonable concern that you

00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,310
know the repository of these documents

00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,370
was a really attractive target for

00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:35,620
hackers so having a document repository

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,210
that could be tied to time stamps it

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,740
could be tied to hashes of those

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,230
documents where you could get a sense of

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,730
is this the complete record of all the

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,880
documents in that system was pretty

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,500
essential so they've been deployed now

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,870
for almost a year they have ten million

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,580
documents in the repository all sorts of

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,920
business illegal processes have actually

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:57,340
converged to deliver this so that's

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,420
really fun to see I just briefly on kind

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,970
of like what's new with each of the

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:04,330
different frameworks fabric was one dot

00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:07,300
oh like mid last year so 1.3 which is in

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,940
release candidate now is ready it's got

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,770
a bunch of new feature support for

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,890
different kinds of languages and the in

00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:17,830
the smart contract system for something

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,990
called zero knowledge assets which is a

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,240
way of kind of having confidentiality

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,430
around trend transactions lots of

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,470
different parameters you can tune when

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,610
if performance is your goal you can

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,610
trade off performance for

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,680
decentralization and get get higher at

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,490
higher speed that way all sorts of

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,850
interesting things

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:39,460
sawtooth as well recently was released

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,010
as 1.0 1.1 is coming up pretty soon and

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,230
it was the first one to support solidity

00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,030
smart contracts these are the smart

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,980
contract languages the smart this is the

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:51,580
smart contract language used by the

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:54,400
etherium ecosystem indy I mentioned is

00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:56,350
kind of our identity focused tool this

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,970
is a network that's being used by

00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,620
somebody called the sovereign foundation

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,510
to Bill

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,460
kind of a global kind of overlay

00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,720
connecting identities across different

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,270
blockchain Ledger's in a way that's

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,980
preservative a protective of individual

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,380
identity and individual confidentiality

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,320
there's a big project in the Philippines

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,360
now to use this to implement a kyc

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,650
mechanism but pivoted around individuals

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,690
it's kind of like if you had control

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,340
over your credit rating your credit

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,679
history and could decide who to share

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,289
that data with and audit that sharing

00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,360
this is a platform for doing that I

00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:29,429
mentioned boro boro is our EVM

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,440
interpreter that gets plugged in to

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,450
sawtooth and actually support in fabric

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,929
for it now this is the only apache

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,610
license DVM out there and it's it's been

00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:40,440
a key part of building a bridge to the

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,970
public ledger community and to the

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,230
community of other companies built

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,940
around that in fact we've announced

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,440
recently last week actually a

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,539
partnership with the enterprise

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,850
aetherium Alliance which is a standards

00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:54,840
body in the enterprise in the etherium

00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:56,940
space that we hope to actually use as a

00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,010
basis for finding other projects that

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,870
are related to the etherium ecosystem

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,700
that we can work on together really

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,559
exciting stuff and finally I mentioned

00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,669
everyone asks about interoperability if

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,309
you have all these different Ledger's

00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:10,260
out there doesn't that hurt your ability

00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:12,059
to to actually have a really fluid

00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,679
marketplace and there's going to be a

00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,870
lot of different approaches to interrupt

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,850
and a lot of different backbone Ledger's

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,350
I think that will connect and act as

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,169
kind of a discovery tool between

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,220
Ledger's but one of our plays here is a

00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:25,230
toolkit it's still pretty young it's

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,779
called quilt and it's an implementation

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:30,390
of the inter ledger standard which is a

00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:31,529
way to do atomic swaps between these

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,029
different networks do you want to buy a

00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:35,460
house and you want to pay for it with

00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:36,779
Bitcoin you really want transactions on

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,120
those two different Ledger's to both

00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:41,610
succeed or both fail otherwise you need

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,740
escrow and all that kind of stuff

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,679
and this is a toolkit for doing those

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,570
kinds of things another big win for us

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,000
in the last year is we put out an

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,500
educational course on EDX that has had

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,510
over a hundred thousand people sign up

00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,190
for it some of you might have taken it

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,370
and and seen my face on the videos and

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,470
and I was sorry for that but it's gotten

00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,690
really great reviews that in fact we are

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:06,029
we've added more content to that we've

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,940
also developed some more formal training

00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:11,130
around managing hyper ledger and saud

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,300
fabric and Sawtooth infrastructure and

00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,430
we'll start do

00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,440
developer certification against those

00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,020
standards and a test for a harness

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,930
against those standards before the end

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,370
of the year and with that that's kind of

00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,010
the state of where we are now it's

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:28,200
really a rocket ship very few of us on

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,790
the on my staff have gotten a full

00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,250
night's of worth of sleep in the last

00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:35,010
couple of months because we've been on

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,600
such a this rocket ship but it's really

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:39,870
exciting and the amount of actual

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,550
productive pick up of these tools I been

00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,470
great to see where it's not aspirational

00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,790
it's real and it's here today thank you

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:49,160
very much

00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:49,160
