thank you for that so hi everybody and

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,460
good afternoon I'm Schell I am the new

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,730
director of ecosystem at the CN CF so

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,870
first question who has heard of the CN

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:21,000
CF okay how many people have not heard

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:24,330
of the CN CF okay cool no more people so

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,359
most people think of the CN CF or the

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,250
cloud native computing foundation as a

00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:32,820
bunch of projects and a bunch of members

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,750
so the most famous project is kubernetes

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,690
and then the members are or include all

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,710
of the large cloud providers across the

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:50,640
US and China so question what's missing

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:52,230
from this answer end users because

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
that's why we build this right that's

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,420
why we work on these products and

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,210
projects

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,670
so the CSUF also hosts a bunch of end

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,660
users including Bloomberg in the end

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,350
user community and my role as director

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,330
of ecosystem is to make these end users

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,890
successful and productive so I've been

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,350
spending some time thinking about how do

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,140
you understand the needs of such a

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,530
diverse group of companies so should you

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,939
sliced it by vertical or by region by a

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:27,659
size or age or market cap but I want to

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:33,000
think about how these companies adopt

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:37,409
cloud native so in a 1994 book crossing

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,170
the chasm more defined the five segments

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,630
of technology consumers you've got the

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,840
innovators the techies who are willing

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,280
to invest hours into making anything and

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,520
everything work and they live on the

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,259
bleeding edge then you've got the early

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,320
adopters who have the insights between

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,020
some emerging technology and a strategic

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,850
opportunity and they can merge those two

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,880
things and they have the personal clout

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,849
to turn that into a high visibility high

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,190
risk project then you get the early

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,110
majority and those are the ones who have

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,930
existing operations

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,080
that they want to improve or improve

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,260
productivity by adopting a new piece of

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,170
tech and hence the chasm between the

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,230
first two and the third segment so the

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:32,210
first two are looking for disruption and

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:36,120
change the early majority wants

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:41,520
continuity and evolution rather than

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:44,550
revolution and not coincidentally the

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:49,680
these segments map onto the CNC F

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:53,160
project identities so sandbox incubating

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,709
and graduation projects so instead of

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,170
thinking about the CNC F as a bunch of

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,880
projects and a bunch of members you can

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,580
think of it as an organization that

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,610
helps open source cloud native

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,720
technology cross the chasm and get

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:12,840
adopted by the mainstream kubernetes was

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,540
the first in 2018 to graduate across the

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,930
chasm in CNC F terms followed by

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,060
Prometheus but it's worth noting that

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,170
chasm crossing isn't the end of the

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,709
story a third of consumers live in the

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:31,110
late majority and those just want

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,580
something that will work they don't

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,850
necessarily want to spend a huge amount

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,440
of time or a lot of need a lot of deep

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,560
expertise to make this work

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,590
so for instance using a managed

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,330
kubernetes service could help reduce the

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:50,489
amount of initial setup and the

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:52,590
operational complexity and of course as

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,459
the tech becomes predictable and

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,350
reliable enough this opens up a new wave

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,950
of innovation and a new bunch of

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,870
projects and that will hopefully

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:08,180
successfully move into that early stage

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,530
so how you and your organization's work

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,510
might have an impact on what sort of

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,840
technologies you should be looking at or

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,840
looking at adopting so if you are in the

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,900
innovator techy section section and you

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,900
can live with half-baked functionality

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,639
and missing documentation and you can

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,479
work directly with project maintainer

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,370
then you could be in the innovators if

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,389
you're an early adopter you will

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,379
probably be looking at what are the

00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,300
business outcomes

00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,979
why should I adopt this tech and what

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,680
impacts would I have on my my

00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:43,560
organization and then if you're in the

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,509
early majority phase you should look at

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,689
the case studies which are published on

00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:51,810
the CNC F website as reference guides

00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:53,759
for from other end users who can help

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:58,469
you understand how they've adopted their

00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,419
tech so if you want to learn more I

00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:02,039
highly recommend you come to one of the

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,710
cube corn or cloud-to-cloud native

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:08,219
cotton events those one now across North

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,689
America Europe and China and I think

00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:11,129
it's the best place to share your

00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:12,409
experiences and to learn from other

00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:16,500
people as well

00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:18,659
and that's it if you'd like to chat to

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,849
me then you can reach me at si hung at

00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:22,949
Linux Foundation org or you can find me

00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:25,180
on Twitter or Cheryl and thank you for

00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,860
your time I hand over to next speaker

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,860
