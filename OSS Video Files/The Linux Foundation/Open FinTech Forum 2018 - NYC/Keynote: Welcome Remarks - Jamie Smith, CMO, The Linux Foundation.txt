we look forward to a really exciting two

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,550
days before I get started I do want to

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,760
take a moment to just do a little bit of

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,250
housekeeping if that works for you most

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,430
importantly thank you to all of our

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,200

first sponsor of a first ever event and

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,090
so we're truly truly grateful to all of

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,010
you for supporting this effort and we

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,590
hope this is the first in many years to

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,000
will connect you with fellow attendees

on common interests based on your common

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,530
interests we have a lot of great content

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,750
and speakers to kick off the event and

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,560
look forward to tomorrow but with that

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,060
said we all know that often some of the

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,409
highest value we get out of these events

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,650
is networking and so and and if you are

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:27,750
inclined there is a reception later this

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,670
evening at Prince George's Ballroom the

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,070
address and the directions are also on

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,869
the back of your badge dinner and drinks

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,829
are provided so we hope that you will

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:40,470
make it there so with that said I

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,390
thought I would take like somewhere

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,320
around an hour maybe to just talk to

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,750
Oliver just make sure you're listening

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,490
so I have like 30 seconds of comments

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,340
and then we'll introduce our speakers so

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,320
I think you all know this but it's worth

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,119
just taking a moment to say that the

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,579
Linux Foundation powers and supports

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,140
some of the most successful shared

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,790
open-source technology projects in the

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,640
world we have over a hundred and 50

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,259
projects that we support and over a

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,649
hundred and 50 events that are happening

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,819
around the world that we lead and some

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,160
of the most exciting things and open

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:18,170
source are happening at these events

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,520
we are in 2018 alone adding a new

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,220
organizational member to the linux

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:28,650
foundation every single day that

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:30,630
includes the weekends um so I just I

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,580
think it's worth noting why why I'm even

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,350
standing here I have actually I'm not a

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,030
tech person I've spent the last 20 years

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,370
of my career focused on sort of that

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,960
intersection between policy and security

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,070
and governance and technology and

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,170
innovation advising a lot of c-level

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,600
executives and CEOs I worked for the

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,550
former president of the United States as

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,350
some former senators and members of

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,190
Congress some former secretaries of

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,300
state and I'm here because I think I'm

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,030
here for the same reason that you're

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,950
here which is that something is big is

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,210
it has been happening an open source but

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,710
the momentum is kicking up significantly

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,230
especially when it comes to financial

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,020
services there are so many different

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,820
ways that the open source world is

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,890
opening up even even more and there are

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,450
people who know a ton about it and are

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,800
extremely detailed and all the

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,730
technology and then there are a

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,500
surprising group of decision-makers who

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,730
are in a position of saying can you tell

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,870
me a little bit more about what that is

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,190
and I don't want to admit I don't know

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,600
about it but I'd really like to

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,350
understand more about what it is and why

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,540
I should care and at the very core of it

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,960
you know what strikes me is that over

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,940
80% of the technology we use every day

00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,410
is open source and I think that's kind

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,780
of a jarring statement and it's just

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,870
because it's becoming even more so

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,130
stock markets cars phones grids retail

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,590
shopping you name it in fact we just

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,110
launched a project where an open source

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,670
in moviemaking so that's exciting to say

00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,590
for the first time ever my mother

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:03,660
understands what I do so that's fun oh

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,800
so what I like to say is that my special

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,180
talent in life is that I take

00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,590
complicated things and I make them make

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,970
sense so it's an honor to be here to

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:15,560
learn from all of you and I want to

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,560
