so yeah my name is Yuri Latino CH and

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,690
I'm a senior cloud engineer at

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,240
Scotiabank

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:15,150
and today I'm gonna talk about the

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,550
journey that we currently going through

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,000
and its how to become a technology

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,920
company in financial services but first

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,439
how many of you heard of Scotiabank here

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,810
quite a few that's good so let me give

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,590
you some numbers on that and Scotiabank

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:39,200
is the bank that is based in Canada we

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,460
have 24 million customers globally and

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,800
that's actually this about the same

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,550
number of people living in Australia and

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:52,230
the month our top markets are not only

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:56,789
Canada but Peru Mexico Chile Colombia

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,270
and other Latin American countries bank

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:04,170
employees ninety six thousand people

00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:05,299
globally having the 27 billions of

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,650
dollars in ready

00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:14,040
it's decent size and only the IT budgets

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:20,369
pants are on the scale of 3.1 billion

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:26,520
dollars annually and in 2016 our CEO

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:29,759
Brian Porter said this we're the

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,189
technology business our product happens

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,490
to be banking but largely that's

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:39,290
delivered through technology and that

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,020
has set a course for the whole bank for

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:48,689
until now basically he said an objective

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:51,420
that we want to transform in a 160 86

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,079
year old organization into a modern

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,930
technology company in financial services

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:01,200
and today I'd like to share with you how

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,340
about this journey and how Scotiabank is

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,369
becoming the technology company in

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:12,560
financial services

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:14,599
so how we do you know that to undergo

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,060
this transformation we have an

00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,849
organization organization called

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,540
platform organization and it's also

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:26,420
known as Plato so Plato is the name for

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:29,120
that orc within a bank and we often

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,200
think of Plata being an engine of

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,780
modernization and we're changing the way

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,209
that things get done including changing

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,000
the way that organization like ours they

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,340
normally operate within a bank and let

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,519
me give you more details for that

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:50,239
so we consider Plato as a software

00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,879
company within a bank with all its

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,030
benefits and being a software company

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,670
we're a profit oriented we're also

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:02,810
customer focused customer centric as

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:05,180
opposed to cost centric and operating as

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,239
a software company played a pretty much

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,790
equips their clients with services just

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,480
needed to get job done abstracting them

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:16,970
from all the nitty-gritty details

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,819
knowing how infrastructure works and all

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,799
these things that so they can focus our

00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:24,109
application teams and developers they

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:28,639
can focus on solving their business

00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:31,340
problems and also we're in kind of a fin

00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,099
tack in that sense operating like a fin

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:38,060
tech its innovative its forward-looking

00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,549
and it's operated like a startup but the

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,030
difference between having that work

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:47,090
within a big bank and typical FinTech is

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:51,019
that we have the backing of a big bank

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:55,840
and it means that we have support from

00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:58,010
all the way from CEO and that allows

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,569
organization like ours to get things

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:04,400
done Plato is also the name of the

00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:07,669
platform we have and if you look at the

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,880
slide here you'll find the components of

00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:14,419
that platform and I would like to focus

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,659
on a number of them the one of the first

00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:19,519
products within Plato to I'm going to

00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:23,660
talk about is

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:27,650
accelerator so think of accelerator is

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,720
as a software development pipeline what

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,210
it pay would this pipeline does it takes

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,639
all the complexity that it takes for a

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,220
typical application in the bank to go to

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,880
production and ultimately solve that

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,340
within this one software delivery

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,180
pipeline it's like an interface like an

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:49,849
abstraction layer that that gathers all

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,900
the tools security scanning tools

00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:56,330
different repositories and it makes sure

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,699
so the security policies are enforced

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,740
and as you know being working in a bank

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:04,099
you've got to make sure your security is

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,710
on the high level and all the other

00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:08,030
requirements and components for

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,300
application to go life to a production

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,699
and if that all happens within that one

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,759
single pipeline when developers run

00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:18,949
their code they use it and after

00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,919
successfully running through it they get

00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:23,960
their app in production so single

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,820
pipeline single way of deploying to

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:31,490
production and that allows us to deliver

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:35,380
fundamental benefit of cloud which is

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:39,979
making change faster velocity

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:42,830
accelerator deploys applications to a

00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:46,219
different product called cloud for cloud

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,590
development platform or CDP CDP is based

00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:53,479
on pivotal Cloud Foundry how many you

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:56,900
have heard of PCF quite a few and it

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:59,319
just provides the cloud capabilities for

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,150
digital and web applications

00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:04,400
applications deployed to CDP they are

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,280
permitted to connect your on-prem

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,370
services and to existing systems and

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,940
they also store the can store data in

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,130
the cloud and instead of just being

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,600
stateless

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:25,390
so let's talk about the cloud because as

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:27,920
I said we have cloud as our primary

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:32,180
fundamental foundational part of Plato

00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:35,330
and we use clout because of the number

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:39,350
of reasons so first of all cloud

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:42,020
provides you with an easier and fast

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,410
access to a superior infrastructure and

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:48,260
that accelerates delivery that sort ins

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,920
the deployment cycles that also have

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:54,290
security all building and one of the key

00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,570
features of cloud is the automated way

00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,180
of infrastructure of getting to

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,890
infrastructure so you just click you go

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,530
to the console and you click a button

00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,900
you get your compute compute resources

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,670
you make an API call you get your

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,400
storage resources it's very easy it's

00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,860
convenient there is no longer need to go

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,940
and wait for hardware to get installed

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,670
in a datacenter

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,710
it just happens like that so it's

00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:22,460
insulin provisioning it happens in

00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:24,890
seconds minutes but also cloud gives you

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,000
dynamic provision which means that if

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:31,340
you have a bigger load you get

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,190
automatically scaled resources to

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,290
accommodate that load if you don't need

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,410
those resources and they're in the idle

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,580
State it's automatically scales down

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,240
which is great

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:47,900
and you pretty much pay for what you use

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:52,430
and for cloud at Scotiabank we decided

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,610
to go public cloud you may ask why

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,640
public cloud and there is a number of

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,400
reasons why we do that using public

00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,150
cloud providers and one of them is that

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,220
public cloud allows you to get economy

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,130
of scale it means that there is this

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:13,190
major cloud provider that has this

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,990
infrastructure and it's shared by many

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,830
customers what it brings it brings

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:23,330
better speed and much less overhead

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:25,430
because then their primary of thing is

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,669
to build this infrastructure and that

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,080
the that makes our costs less

00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:32,060
another good

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,399
a reason to go public cloud is higher

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,740
performance because cloud providers they

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,459
invest money in building this

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:44,000
infrastructure and services and for

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:46,720
example storage in the public cloud can

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,850
have like seven or more nines of

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:55,120
durability it can have zero replication

00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:57,769
which is might be a little tough for a

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,510
regular enterprise let's say to build

00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:04,180
the same same good technology around it

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:08,029
among other reasons is of course it's

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,430
better security a big cloud providers

00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:14,630
they can afford hiring thousands of

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:17,329
people to actually do secure the cloud

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,420
and despite having this work public in

00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:24,920
it it's actually can be done very

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:27,950
securely and of course you pay for what

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,500
you use if you use this you pay only for

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:34,760
X amount of resources and there is no

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:39,680
upfront cost on journey in the cloud but

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:44,029
we also love to say that using cloud is

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,850
just a method cloud is a method it's not

00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:50,959
a location that's the phrase that we

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,060
often use and what it means is that it's

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,350
not only about moving things to the

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:59,930
cloud about taking your application and

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,910
putting it as is to run it in public

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,440
cloud it's about building all the

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,860
processes around it it's about

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,550
transforming the way application is

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,860
built if your application is monolithic

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:15,709
while you modernize your infrastructure

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,720
your processes you want to make sure to

00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:22,730
make it micro services if that makes

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,980
sense that also gives you it's about

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,589
modernizing development process it's

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,800
about building continuous integration

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:33,250
continuous delivery around it and that

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,449
all increases velocity because

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,149
eventually it's all about velocity

00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:42,130
software technology companies they

00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:43,830
operate as a faster that what makes a

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,020
technology company

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,140
a software company and that's what we do

00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:53,130
at the bank we try to operate as a

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:55,010
software company and this is a this is a

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,390
cloud journey we've been going through

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:01,050
and Scotiabank

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:03,600
can be proud of being a innovative

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,580
leader in many areas like well for

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,940
example a scotia bank is the first

00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:12,570
Canadian bank to open branches and

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:15,900
outside of Canada beyond the UK and us

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:20,180
it also be is the first Canadian bank to

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:23,520
appoint women as a branch managers and

00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,580
I'm also excited to say that Scotia Bank

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:31,310
is the first bank in North America that

00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:33,930
goes open-source we've open sourced a

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:38,400
number of components of the accelerator

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:41,190
pipeline I've mentioned and we believe

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,490
that doing so promotes this innovation

00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,950
among the industry and that also keeps

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,500
us diligent so if you're interesting

00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:53,130
check this link github.com slash

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:56,160
Scotiabank to learn more but that's not

00:11:53,130 --> 00:12:02,400
it and Scotiabank another way of

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:05,220
modernizing things there is by becoming

00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,190
a value-added reseller we're in that

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:11,490
journey and we believe that being a

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:15,180
value-added reseller by adding some

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:17,910
custom software on top of our services

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,200
from Microsoft from Google from pivotal

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:24,570
and selling it to the rest of the bank

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,020
that also demonstrate that your parade

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,940
as a software company and with all the

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:36,810
benefits that it brings and our

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:39,630
innovation journey continues so I want

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:42,930
to say the quote by Steve Jobs and it

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,790
says that technology is nothing what's

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,250
important is that you have faith in

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:50,550
people and they're they're basically

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,740
good and smart and if you give them

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,410
right tools they do wonderful things

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,059
with them that's what we believe at

00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,549
Scotia Bank as well

00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,469
so modernizing the organization it's not

00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:03,479
only about changing the technology it's

00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:05,579
also about changing the culture in it

00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:07,349
it's about changing people it's about

00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:11,149
changing the mindset of how you approach

00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:14,329
problems how how you solve them and

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:18,479
bring Edgehill practices in place and

00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:22,019
even change in your workspace and right

00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:25,399
now Scotiabank is in the process the the

00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:27,919
platform organization is moving to

00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,909
so-called activity-based working

00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:34,579
workspace how many of you heard of

00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:37,559
activity-based working one person good

00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:39,179
so you know it's innovative and we

00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:43,799
believe that it will improve our

00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:46,409
efficiency and in all that stuff so and

00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:50,819
from being an engineer working for this

00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:52,849
kind of projects I can say that I love

00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:55,889
the journey for a number of reasons

00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:57,569
because one of the reasons is that you

00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:59,689
find yourself being part of this

00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:03,749
transformational journey that happens

00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:05,819
once once in a while and what I like

00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:08,519
also is working with greatest and latest

00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:10,379
tools like we use Google Cloud we use

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,649
Microsoft Azure over work was pivotal

00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:16,529
cloud foundry we work with kubernetes

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,749
cloud databases real-time events

00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:22,589
streaming and also you work with smart

00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:24,869
people around you that make this ideas a

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:29,519
reality and they generate bright ideas

00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:32,869
and working as big Bank being a software

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,689
company inside of a big bank is also

00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:38,519
good from the perspective that you have

00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:41,279
this you feel that you have the support

00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,649
of CEO and when you get the support you

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,819
know that this ideas this bright ideas

00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:50,549
of innovation and modernization they are

00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:53,189
happening and we have enough fuel to

00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:55,739
make that success to make that

00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:58,619
successful but I think the most

00:14:55,739 --> 00:15:03,689
importantly is that that gives you this

00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:07,439
sense of purpose that you you do world

00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:09,539
that matters and by performing that way

00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,330
you're contributing to the well-being

00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:12,400
around

00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:15,130
and that you're changing the face of the

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:19,900
industry which is considered to be

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:23,320
pretty conservative by many and not

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,180
that's innovative as let's say software

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,820
industry so being a part of that

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,620
projects really is a gives you some kind

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,340
of purpose and feeling that your work

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,950
matters and if you're excited about the

00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,640
journey to about solving interesting

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:43,450
engineering challenges and you like

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:46,540
working with agile teams and digitally

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:52,350
transform industry I have good news for

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:55,150
