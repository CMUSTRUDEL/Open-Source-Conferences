thank you for stopping by our booth for

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,520
this demo

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,480
i'm joe pearson and i'm here to

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,200
demonstrate

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,960
low-touch automated onboarding and

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,920
application delivery

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,880
with secure device onboarding and open

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,560
horizon

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,560
two lf edge projects

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,560
i'd like to show you how secure device

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,519
onboard

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
or sdo can eliminate the need for

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,800
manually

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,599
installing and configuring the open

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,960
horizon

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,840
agent software this then allows open

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
horizon

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
to deliver containerized workloads to

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,559
edge compute nodes

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,840
and to manage their life cycle to

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,840
illustrate this

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,840
here's a hypothetical scenario

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,239
laura wants to install smart cameras

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,520
in five factories these cameras would be

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,239
used for visual

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,239
inspection

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,160
laura's challenge is to get the cameras

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,640
configured

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,440
with the proper software and network

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,640
placement

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
before installation

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,280
this means having the cameras shipped to

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,560
a central location for software loading

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,280
and configuration before reshipping them

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,240
out to the factories

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,960
or sending technicians out into the

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,960
field

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
after the cameras are already delivered

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,280
to the factories

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,840
to load the software and configure it on

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,840
premises

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,520
either approach will introduce a week or

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,479
more

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,400
of delay require extensive project

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,600
management coordination

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,880
and introduce extra expense

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,759
if the smart cameras supported sdo all

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,560
three of those issues can be mitigated

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,560
let's see how

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,560
first laura orders smart cameras that

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
support

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,719
sdo a manufacturer can initialize the

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,280
camera

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,040
while it is being built generating a

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,080
public private key pair

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,759
and an ownership voucher when laura's

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
purchase is complete

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,560
she has sent those vouchers that

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,400
uniquely identify each camera

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,599
these vouchers will be used to

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,720
authenticate and

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,640
authorize each camera at a later point

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,640
when the ownership is transferred

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,480
second laura sends the vouchers to the

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,800
team

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,519
that is responsible for loading and

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,319
configuring the software on the cameras

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
that team loads the vouchers into an

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,680
open horizon

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,480
management hub that they are operating

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,480
for this purpose

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,360
third the team associates the vouchers

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
with a specific node policy that will be

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,080
deployed

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
onto the cameras that identify

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,680
themselves as having a purpose

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,680
a visual inspection

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,879
fourth the camera devices arrive at the

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,360
destination factories

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,959
and local technicians mount them in

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,720
their proper locations

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,480
and connect power and network

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,480
connectivity before turning them on

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,120
fifth the cameras boot up and

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,000
automatically connect to the sdo

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,480
services

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,360
at a well-known location presenting

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,480
their voucher to confirm their identity

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,720
the sdo services authenticate them and

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,080
send back software to be installed on

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,000
the smart camera

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,440
which in this case would include the

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
docker runtime

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,000
and the open horizon agent software as

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,000
well as the node policy file

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,200
sixth once the software is installed and

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,920
configured

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,400
the open horizon agent contacts the open

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,040
horizon management hub services

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,280
and registers itself by presenting

00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,080
authorization credentials

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,200
it then publishes its node policy file

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,400
seventh the open horizon management hub

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,920
agreement bot service monitors for newly

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,519
registered nodes

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,680
looking for those that match the

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,560
service's constraint of purpose

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,200
equals visual inspection when it finds a

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,479
match

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,759
it enters into negotiation when and if

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,079
that negotiation

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,520
is successfully completed the smart

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,840
camera device has sent

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,360
information about the visual inspection

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,680
service

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,600
eight the smart camera retrieves its

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,919
visual inspection docker image

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,400
from the specified image registry and

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,400
runs it

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,120
so what you just saw was a solution that

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,880
did not require

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
either a point-to-point connection

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,440
between administrator and device

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,400
nor hands-on access to the physical

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,320
devices

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,800
in order to install and configure the

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,800
software

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,199
so if you'd like to learn more we have

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,919
additional materials available

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,199
about both the sdo project and the open

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,960
horizon project

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,520
as well as several other videos and

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,400
materials that go into greater detail

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,680
we also have links to the sdl and open

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,759
horizon project github repositories

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,039
open horizon also has a quick start set

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,639
of instructions

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,199
that will show you how to install a

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,160
simple all-in-one developer installation

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,160
of the management

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,880
management hub agent and sdo services

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,199
within a single vm in less than five

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,199
minutes

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,759
our booth attendants are also here to

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,800
answer any questions you may have

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,960
about sdo open horizon and workload

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,240
management for edge computing

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,240
