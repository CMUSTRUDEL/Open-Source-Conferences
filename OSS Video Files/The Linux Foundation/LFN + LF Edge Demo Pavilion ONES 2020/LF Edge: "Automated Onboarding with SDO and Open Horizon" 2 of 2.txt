hello i'm glenn darling from the open

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,480
horizon team

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,839
and i'd like to talk to you about secure

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
device onboarding

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,679
with zero touch imagine

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,800
being able to buy diverse edge devices

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,439
from various distributors or retailers

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,039
shipping them off to one of your remote

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,880
sites like a store

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:29,599
or a power plant or a substation

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,679
or any of your remote locations

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,320
and then just getting the local

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,760
technician to plug the thing in

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,960
apply power and network and then have it

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,239
magically okay not magically but fully

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,160
autonomously

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,520
install and configure all of the

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,440
required software

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,920
no ssh no usb nothing else

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,800
would that help your business would that

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,120
enable you to save some money

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,800
well open horizon with secure device

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,359
onboarding or sdo

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
will do exactly that on intel and arm

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,799
devices

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,320
and optionally it can use the hardware

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,880
root of trust or

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,960
like a trusted platform module if you

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,000
have it on the device

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,280
so how does it work first of all the sdo

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
software is installed at the

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,000
manufacturer

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,640
and then an ownership voucher is created

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,840
and it always goes along with

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,840
the device

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
the ownership voucher stays with the

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,400
device as it goes through the whole

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
supply chain so factory to distributor

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,880
to

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,720
whatever and ends up at the end customer

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,640
then when the end customers receive

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,560
their devices and their vouchers

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,840
they load the vouchers into an open

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,840
horizon management hub

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,000
and then in turn the open horizon

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,479
management hub uses this voucher to

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
tell the sdo rendezvous server how to

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,479
install the open horizon

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,240
agent onto the corresponding device and

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,040
configure it for this specific

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,040
management hub

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
now from that point onward it's fully

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,520
automated and we have our little agents

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,360
that are going to take care of

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,800
everything for us so it'll be

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,000
zero touch so once the voucher is loaded

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
onto open horizon

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
and the sdo rendezvous server has been

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,200
informed the customer can then just

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,200
start connecting their devices

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,200
on first power up each device reaches

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,280
out to the well-known address

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,599
of the sdo rendezvous server with an

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,879
identifier corresponding to its specific

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,360
ownership voucher the sdo rendezvous

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,760
server

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
responds with an open horizon agent

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,519
install script

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,480
and configuration details for this

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,519
specific

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,680
device then the sdo rendezvous server is

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
no longer required

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,120
the device can then automatically

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,280
install and configure the agent for the

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,920
appropriate open horizon management hub

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,040
and that happens without any user action

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,400
at all

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,080
the configuration includes the

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,959
appropriate open horizon device

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,080
credentials

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,599
and the deployment pattern or policy

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
the agent will then reach out to the

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,879
management hub and negotiate the

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,200
appropriate software deployment

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:18,080
using normal open horizon procedures

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,800
so let's do a quick review in the

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,879
factory

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,599
ownership vouchers are created and sdo

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,599
software is installed onto the device

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,840
vouchers and devices stay together all

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,159
the way out to the customer

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,879
the end customer loads the vouchers into

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,640
an open horizon

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,920
management hub and the open horizon

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,760
management hub sets up the

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,599
sdo rendezvous server for each

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,400
individual device

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,040
with zero touch the devices power up

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
contact

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,959
the sdo rendezvous server to get their

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,159
install scripts and their configuration

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,239
details

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,080
the devices then install and configure

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,720
the open horizon agent

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,480
and then from then on the open horizon

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,480
agent can take control

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,319
negotiate with the open horizon egg bots

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,159
as usual to manage all of the

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,720
containerized application software life

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,319
cycles

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,319
on the device from then onward

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,159
so this is available now as a tech

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,560
preview

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,439
only so it's not for production use in

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,359
ibm edge application manager version 4.1

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,359
which is an open horizon installation

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
if you wish to get some more information

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,160
about this you can use the

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,680
url shown in yellow on the screen here

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:34,160
hope you enjoyed this presentation and

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,160
