hello now i will show you up uh how to

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,920
deploy under clear container on

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:14,000
the device basically you will use

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:18,560
eve as an operating system but eve as a

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,160
hypervisor that can run many things

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,000
like containers like vms on any

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,199
architecture

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,679
and it can run windows linux

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:35,040
also it can run flip container

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:39,440
so first we will

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,719
clone the eden project so

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,000
eden is a project that allows

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,120
management of eve adam

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,680
and eden itself then we go

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,680
to the eden directory and

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,920
we

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,720
uh and we will make up

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,200
an image for google cloud platform

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,600
google cloud platform is the easiest way

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,159
to

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,720
work with uh eve also you

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,360
by specifying for example dev model api

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,040
you can build up a raspberry image

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,320
uh if you don't specify any

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,840
uh parameter then you will run

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:32,479
everything locally so right now

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:37,280
it's building up uh so we have one

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:40,479
then we need to specify the ip address

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,960
on which eden itself will run because if

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,799
will be deployed on gcp

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,960
so we specify uh

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,799
the address where eve will connect

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,399
after that we just

00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,600
specify some tagged if image

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:06,320
uh then i will show you up

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:09,520
how to actually

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,000
update the image as well

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,000
then we run setup

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,239
so we see that the leave image is

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,959
generated so

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,680
we the only thing that we need is to

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,080
upload it

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,080
and run

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,440
also here we have the

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,800
[Music]

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,800
google service key

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,319
okay the image is created

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
then we just run the image

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,840
that's it

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,519
and start the hidden so the image

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,280
is the image of the machine

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,840
with eve so we started hidden

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,840
now

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:18,159
now we can on board

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:21,360
if so we can see the status

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:32,959
so we don't see eve yet

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:37,680
but by issuing this command

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:42,159
we will register if on our system

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:46,720
so we see right now we see that

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:50,319
we the status has changed and now

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:54,959
we are waiting for some ids from

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:58,879
eve so right now we see the ips

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,879
and then we just

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:07,840
have one command

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,840
to update the container

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:19,519
so we send the request

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,519
and check the status of this request

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,479
and now the system is running

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,120
so now i see that the system is actually

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,120
