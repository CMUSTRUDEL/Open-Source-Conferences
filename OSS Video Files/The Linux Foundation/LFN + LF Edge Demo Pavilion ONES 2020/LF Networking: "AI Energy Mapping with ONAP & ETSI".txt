hello everyone destination from channel

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,759
bio

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,559
this time i want to introduce why i

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,400
evolution with the olaf case

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,599
back into the etsy ei which is

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,840
implemented by channel

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,759
with the compression of intel corner

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,119
cloud aluminum s3

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,199
okay let's begin firstly with more and

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,880
more infrastructure being involved

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,320
into the network that's analogous

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,720
becoming a much more

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
complexity so how to make the operation

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,599
more intensive and

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,079
needed and was tangent and a smarter is

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,559
the biggest energy

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,640
thanks to the olaf however latino

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,800
announcer was a design fantasy

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,239
what is the olaf olympic is a

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,719
comprehensive platform

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,360
for orchestration management and other

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,760
mission

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,520
of lateral energy computing servers for

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,079
network operator

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,160
cloud provider and enterprise retirement

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,360
currency driving orchestration

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,039
on the machine or physical and virtual

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,920
network's advantages enable

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,920
repeat automation of leo servers and

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,320
companies live cycle management

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,920
critical for 5g and next generation

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,760
networks

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,479
what is the ui its printer network

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,119
intelligence is defined a cognitive

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,600
network

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,240
management advisor using air techniques

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,439
and

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,119
contains a wire policy to adjust offered

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,799
service based on change the user it is

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,560
environmental condition and business

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,320
course it is therefore

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,479
foreign is automated

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,520
services pricing operating and not

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,720
assurance

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,759
as aware of the science management and

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,720
resource

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,479
orchestration ei has also announced the

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,240
proof of concepts i mean to

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,840
demonstrate how techniques can be used

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,280
to access that our operation include

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,399
pharmacy

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,600
the user of ai and technics internet

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,880
were also problems of future and i was

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,880
deploying and operations

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,440
we introduced a case of ei combined with

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,319
the olap

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,680
which is a young protein intelligent

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,280
telecom networking

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,319
energy optimization which meaning

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,680
employment biosome or lab approved in

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,080
general internally

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:30,720
that's for one year optimum numbers

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,720
including by inter controlled analysis

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,760
the case is mean to showcase the network

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,800
every i was

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,959
possibly proposed and developed

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
by the collateral with a special

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,599
attention to the ai ml

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,640
aspects in the containers defined by the

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,280
ei

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,959
the case intended to test and manage

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,680
opposes the negatives

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,040
proposed by the architecture of electro

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,160
self-organization and

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,160
energy operating

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,120
this case consists of two scenarios the

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,360
first layer is to demonstrate that

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,760
the air based techniques enable the

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,959
vitamin ms to be horizontal and vertical

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,800
screening

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,080
lateral containment to be staff when i

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
see that

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
the second scenario shows that cpu

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,840
frequency can be raised

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,720
to 20 by turning down intended to cpu

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,720
power 7.

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,280
the case many can be split into four

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,080
parts real-time series telemetry data

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,200
canada

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,440
from recipient and we have epc

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,720
infrastructure better platform clashing

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,239
agents

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,440
use applications

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,560
and influence to be processed

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,120
online or offline as required but i have

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,560
a screening

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,599
pf challenge on the cpu

00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:01,840
tuning down command send back to the

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,840
epc infrastructure

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,400
in the following video it will showcase

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,519
how i achieve

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,840
intelligent power management by alderman

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,919
we have several scaling and adjusting

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,600
simple frequency based on the

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,960
integration with an amount driven

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,960
elastic platform yes projects we work

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,120
together and offer a higher

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,560
manageability easier maintenance and air

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,000
driver management

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,800
location servers achievable

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
nasty gum analogue service scanning and

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,840
intelligent power management

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,680
power consumption in fast environment

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,800
must be heavier than before to full

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,680
phase high speed

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,680
rather connectively and various kinds of

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,720
service level agreements

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,360
in the case we developed an air driven

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,280
with automatic access to pre-configure

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,520
and press again in the servers

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,520
for the future demands also simple

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
frequency is optimized to improve power

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,199
impedance

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,039
when the system determines to scan the

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,560
system automatically slow down

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,440
the cpu frequency then start to timing

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,160
the two valves

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:24,160
and mark the series penetrate show in

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:26,960
the decibel

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,720
in the same scenario when the system is

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,360
determined to scare out

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,160
the system speed up cpu from semi-while

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,440
the system

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
also lands towards the maxillaries are

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,479
sent

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,360
during the static board to figure out

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:53,360
the community of

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:57,360
the service

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
