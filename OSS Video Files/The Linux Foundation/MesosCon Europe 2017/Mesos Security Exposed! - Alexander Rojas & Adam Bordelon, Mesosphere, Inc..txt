	Mesos Security Exposed! - Alexander Rojas & Adam Bordelon, Mesosphere, Inc.

Security is one of the major pursuits of Apache Mesos since it reduces the amount of concerns operators have to worry about. As such, every year a lot of work is done to reduce the work of operators when running their clusters. In this year’s talk we will focus on:

* Authentication and authorization of the V1 API
* Executor authentication (JWT, claims)
* Secrets as first class citizens.
* Elliptic Curve cryptography support.
* Enhanced isolation.

Come learn about these topics and share your thoughts on security.
