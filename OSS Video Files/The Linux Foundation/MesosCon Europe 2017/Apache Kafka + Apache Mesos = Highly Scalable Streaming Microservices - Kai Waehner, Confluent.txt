Description: 
	Apache Kafka + Apache Mesos = Highly Scalable Streaming Microservices - Kai Waehner, Confluent

This session discusses how to build a highly scalable, performant, mission-critical microservice infrastructure with Apache Kafka and Apache Mesos. Apache Kafka brokers are used as powerful, scalable, distributed message backbone. Kafka Streams’ API allows to embed stream processing directly into any microservice or business application; without the need for a dedicated streaming cluster. Apache Mesos is used as scalable infrastructure 
under the hood of Apache Kafka and Kafka Streams applications to 
leverage the benefits of a cloud native platforms like service discovery, health checks, or fail-over management.

A live demo shows how to develop real time applications for your core business with Kafka messaging brokers and Kafka Streams API and how to deploy / manage / scale them on a Mesos cluster using different deployment options like Marathon, Docker, Kubernetes.
