	There and Back Again: How Tunstall Healthcare Built an IoT Platform for Health Monitoring Using Mesos Cluster on Azure - Fredrik Lindner, Tunstall Nordic AB

When designing a platform for collecting wellbeing and health telemetry data, Tunstall decided to use mesos as the backbone service orchestration tool. In this talk Fredrik Lindner from the Tunstall I&D department will show how the implementation of a telemetry IoT platform requires a robust, scalable foundation and how well Mesos fits into this scenario.

In addition, We will provide Tunstallâ€™s learnings by presenting the implementation process from the early stages, using templates on Azure, to the production-ready solution using custom made deploy and scale templates, integration with legacy applications and the high level of security and auditing that is required in the healthcare business. During the talk we will also show a demo of how we use Mesos to scale the platform from 500 telemetry sources to 1000000 telemetry sources without changing a single line of code or configuration
