	A Year with Apache Aurora - Rick Mangi, Chartbeat

Chartbeat, a real time web publishing analytics platform made the decision last year to migrate the bulk of our workload from puppet managed AWS EC2 instances to Aurora. Today, the majority of our migration is done and this talk will focus on what we learned and the decisions made along the way, including what not to migrate to Aurora. We chose to adopt Aurora for a variety of reasons: cost savings from better resource utilization, consistent deployments and monitoring of services, streamlining of the development workflow and the ability to approach scaling our platform holistically. Aurora has helped us to reign in server sprawl and get a much better handle on our footprint. We don't claim to have done everything "right", but it works for us and that's all that matters.
