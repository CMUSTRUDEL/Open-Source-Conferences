	00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,240
so I just want to quickly have you each

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,460
introduce yourselves

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,290
um you know say which company you're

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,599
from and a little bit about what your

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,219
company's doing just briefly before we

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,679
get into the questions maybe some of

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,299
your own background so start with Devin

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,430
so my name is Devin Bauer

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,250
so I'm coming from Audi I'm heading a

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,920
department that is taking care of let's

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,640
say collecting and processing all the

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,400
data

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,789
our cars are producing during the usage

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,910
of the car so we primarily building up a

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,300
platform which should be able to be very

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,690
flexible and to handle a lot of data as

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,059
I said we will be able to make good new

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,960
products for our customers so personally

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:50,010
I'm with Audi since I guess 15 years so

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,600
we have a history in software of course

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,940
mainly in the embedded software and now

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,070
we are spreading out into the packin

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,850
software as well so that the car is part

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,890
of the IOT world yeah I'm who batricia

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,260
order from Audion the senior project

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,780
manager of the IRT project collecting

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,220
weekly sensor data I've been in several

00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,470
project before within the company and

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,090
now I'm part of that transition the

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,640
company goes through from a pure

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,060
hardware developing company to an IOT

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,090
company hello my name is Oliver goalie's

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,210
from Deutsche Telekom Manager in the

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,850
networks and service area we are using

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:34,650
DCOs in particular and this mac stack

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:37,439
for creating more value for customers in

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,560
terms of selecting access networks so or

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:45,710
I can briefly and give more updates

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,149
later but who using smack stack for that

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:52,110
good morning my name is Cassandra ops

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:55,470
I'm product architect or within a SML so

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:59,820
I'm doing this for a project which is a

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:02,280
compute and data platform we are I think

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,729
quite new in the smack stack so we

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,729
started beginning of this year and we

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,849
are not using all of the letters right

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:16,469
now and so I'm eager to learn and

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:19,379
exchange information throughout disease

00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,269
next two days great so we'll start again

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,230
with you I sort of want to ask as much

00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,999
as you can share about your

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,590
infrastructure with regard to what

00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:27,239
technologies using the size of the

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,040
infrastructure whatever you're

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:34,049
comfortable sharing I'm sure many in the

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,540
audience would be interested to know for

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:39,060
us a challenge is we are a Dutch

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:43,499
equipment manufacturer which are sending

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,810
out machines to our customers and these

00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:48,359
machines are operating and creating a

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,629
tremendous amount of data and our

00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:54,829
compute platform now needs to be able to

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:57,419
properly scale and compute and storage

00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:00,599
but also needs to be able to properly

00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,699
actually take the individual failure

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:07,129
modes down to cross data center

00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:10,769
availability and that's we have chosen

00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:14,599
mezzos for infrastructure that you can

00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:19,079
actually operate the compute and data

00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:23,400
capabilities so we are all that stack we

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:25,019
are using mezzos and the kafka part we

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,560
are heading out to the spark

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,250
computations in the future and map

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,169
that's what we are

00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,620
oliver tell us about Deutsche Telekom

00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:40,530
yeah so we had a problem that we started

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,720
about two years ago I think everyone

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,629
knows it at least we have all of the

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,400
Wi-Fi password here on our batch but

00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:49,349
actually we try to automate that so that

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,239
our customers can get into Wi-Fi

00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:53,879
networks but with a good very good

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,239
quality so if the Wi-Fi is really poor

00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:59,009
you don't get there so what we started

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,799
to build is a mobile application that

00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:04,680
collects enormous amount of information

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,409
about the access networks you're facing

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,919
as a customer and we want to give

00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:14,639
recommendations or - oh no mobile

00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:18,750
application deployed which in X networks

00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,729
you are going to be steered and this was

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,300
quite a challenge to go with a whole

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:27,990
stack infrastructure and since we're

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,840
we expect a bigger customer base come

00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,150
there the distributed way of all this

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,289
max Decker's designed gives us quite a

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:39,389
lot of opportunities here yeah so we

00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:42,470
have already we have millions of car out

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,250
there equipped with onboard

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,580
communication you need for data

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:51,360
collecting listening to the bus systems

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:55,020
in the car and sending those data

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,949
generated out to a back-end so back in

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:03,150
this our project to set up we use all

00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:06,090
the five letters of this max tag to

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,539
ingest those data to do real-time

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,550
analytics of those data coming in

00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:15,300
identifying patterns and cause reactions

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:20,039
back in the car to the customer and we

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:22,919
do use Park for the for that specific

00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,740
purpose the whole infrastructure is

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,050
currently based on Amazon but we have

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,250
the approach to be and to stay cloud

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:35,940
agnostic and for that this us helps us a

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,819
lot to spread the load between different

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,710
cloud providers to get an perfect

00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:45,630
exploitation of the cloud resources

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:47,580
which are expensive and we stay

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:51,979
independent from any cloud provider so

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:58,409
we can switch from one - or to another

00:05:51,979 --> 00:06:01,620
in using this us great take a look at

00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:04,080
some more aspects as we are a global

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,020
company forces we are very important to

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,750
also have global solutions and for that

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,909
we know there are different countries

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,949
where maybe we can use immerse or maybe

00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,830
we are not able to use maybe in the look

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:20,759
to China there's always a little bit

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:22,770
let's say legal uncertainty what you can

00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,779
do so what is very very crucial to be

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,120
able to independently from from the from

00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:29,759
the single infrastructure infrastructure

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,740
provider and even to have the

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,159
possibility to make some hybrid

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,639
solutions as part of the box one group

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:39,789
we also have in

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,340
of internal capacity for 14th ascenders

00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:45,129
so in future I have in mind that we

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:49,930
really could use both internal external

00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:51,430
data center for this purpose so I think

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,979
I heard a little bit from from a couple

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:58,300
of you using the full smack stack so

00:06:53,979 --> 00:07:00,310
that's SPARC maysa akka Cassandra and

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,560
Kafka so you guys are using all the

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,199
letters I think most of the panel here

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,960
and then well you're using three of them

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,939
right yeah okay

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,319
so what I guess specifically speaking to

00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:14,169
this mac stack and the collection of

00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,449
technologies that is what has that on

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:18,039
the application level you've touched

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:20,199
upon that a little bit but is if there's

00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,169
anything you'd like to add what has that

00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:26,469
specific data driven pipeline done for

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:30,339
you well I guess the most important

00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:32,979
thing is the fastest fastest Ness as we

00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:35,919
want to do our analytics in real time so

00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:38,310
really want to go out and to go into the

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,259
field of being able to react immediately

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,479
on situations that are happening in a

00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:45,909
single car and were that we we have to

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,969
be able to to know what's happening

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:50,830
outside and to be able to to get the

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:53,319
knowledge that we get it from from the

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,569
rest of the fleet to be able to send

00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,930
directly to the single call so that's

00:07:55,569 --> 00:08:02,110
crucial force yeah and next to the whole

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:05,169
analytic stuff it's important for us not

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,629
to lose any data you can imagine we have

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:11,169
millions of cars sending in seconds

00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:13,899
millions of data so we need some kind of

00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:16,089
infrastructure which is capable of

00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:20,050
collecting those data and not losing any

00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:21,520
of those yeah sure I'm just at the

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,180
distributed workloads are quite an

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,039
advantage of this Mac stack especially

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,539
if you don't have customers there you

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,339
can really scale down the infrastructure

00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,740
as well it's just not support it's not

00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:34,779
so bad as well yeah which sort of leads

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,760
me into my next question and we'll start

00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,199
over there sort of that that's talking

00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,690
about the application level but also the

00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:43,839
infrastructure level how using

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:46,589
containers and DCOs and mesas and this

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,760
Mac stack has really has that helped you

00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:50,320
you know build out your infrastructure

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,730
and plan for the future

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,810
if you could speak to that a little bit

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:58,570
few so yeah so what we are looking

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,570
forward to and what also the last year

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,400
of that project has shown that we gain

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,040
actually the capability and the

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,240
flexibility to scale to have the high

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,610
availability to also dynamically use and

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,680
reuse the resources that are on the

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,530
hardware level available for our

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,140
applications and what we build within

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,090
our compute and data platform is the

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,100
foundation for the applications that are

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,380
built on top of that so also we are

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:31,300
providing a middle layer towards our

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:33,520
application developers actually sure and

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,650
just to add this was not an easy road to

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,620
get everything in the containers but

00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,800
yeah so did you incrementally or did you

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,750
do like one big we built completely new

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,170
because the mind shift is quite hard

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,760
well telcos maybe sometimes occur to be

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,650
a little bit old-fashioned so when I

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:57,010
started the project we asked and where's

00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:59,350
the VM so yeah yeah yeah talking about

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,090
containers we're looking forward to two

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,190
software-defined networking and some

00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,560
defined storage so that would be a

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:09,550
really good good next step for the

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,600
holistic so as you're looking we've got

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,760
a lot of people in the audience are

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,670
planning on moving to this Mac stack or

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,870
her just getting started if you could

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,310
talk about some of the challenges or

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,020
successes that you've had in your

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:27,370
migration over to a smack stack that

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:29,230
people can benefit from I guess when we

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,170
have you know in our history our

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:36,250
whiskers recommend try to start on a

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:39,070
green field to really get up from

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,230
scratch to be able to get all the

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:46,600
advantages you get out of such as max

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:48,880
tech and the second issue is start with

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,090
some POC so of course on an open source

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,610
basis but we really want to be in the

00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,470
enterprise level so for our companies we

00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,080
have big companies here on the on the

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,150
end around here you need professional

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,850
support you need professional services

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:07,029
so as soon as possible

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,069
change to the enterprise versions yes

00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:13,839
it's advertising year

00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:15,730
I didn't you say that no SEC in our in

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,829
our mind we Nikko to my poor and say

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,990
okay you're introducing new and new

00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:22,810
architecture in your software so where's

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,220
the support structure who could be

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,500
calling something is going wrong

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,930
how what about a down time what about

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,180
some issues our backs whatever because a

00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,790
lot of the board members think open

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,100
source is something for freaks something

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,980
for yeah you can do it in India or at

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:43,300
your home based software development but

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,860
nothing for enterprise so to to convince

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,420
them that it's a professional way of

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,800
working enterprise versions of very

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,329
quickly about go back to green fields um

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,699
did you have existing infrastructure

00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:56,500
that you had to move over or were you

00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:00,040
able to really to start with a fresh

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,930
project yes we were lucky and head and

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,420
be able to stop the fresh project okay

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:08,290
so with the with the clean Amazon

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:12,100
infrastructure right there we had the

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:13,899
same challenge we needed to convince our

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,670
management that we don't go with our

00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,490
operations team but rather are deployed

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:21,579
on Azure because we're faster in doing

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,779
of using a public cloud service and we

00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:24,250
directly started with the premium

00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:28,120
support of the premium Enterprise

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:30,189
licenses and it's just easier with the

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,279
support of the vendor and we iterated

00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:37,120
very in very small cycles this helped us

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,350
a lot not to go too far just one step

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,029
ahead and did you have a legacy

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,100
infrastructure to move over at all or

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:45,009
were you starting everything you yeah

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:50,490
everything it's the easiest way I'm sure

00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:53,769
it is yeah about over so yes we we are

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:56,529
to two-way actually so we do have a

00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:58,660
hardware platform that we currently ship

00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:01,029
to our customers where our software's

00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:04,540
running on but we have to grow out of

00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:06,279
that infrastructure so we move into our

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,399
customers data center with the

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:12,370
deployment of our platform and the

00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,500
second aspect is that we do have to keep

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,350
the investments that we had already to

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:20,620
the compute stack so we have to

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,360
first also create new processes together

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,270
with our customers and close

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,340
collaboration and second we have to make

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,040
sure that our investments stay still

00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:33,850
active I want to compute level so the

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,680
migration that we did from the Java

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,260
Enterprise world into a more

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,180
fine-grained containerized architecture

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:45,460
it works it's doable and this is what we

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,930
did in the past could you give a few

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,580
more details about or were there any

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:53,380
challenges specific things you could

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,220
give advice at the migration um two

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,790
challenges

00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,340
it's a also a new software stack most of

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:04,540
is in our organization so you do have to

00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,580
do a lot of convincing people and

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,450
showing that it really works it's a

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:12,040
different way of doing the development

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:16,600
but yeah you have to do your homework in

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,870
order to bring that to the audience it's

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,580
also like kind of community management

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:24,940
you could say so and the second aspect

00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:30,190
is on customer side they also have the

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:32,500
same challenges from moving the yeah the

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,150
ownership of that hardware stack from

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,670
the business people to their own IT

00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,920
department that's also the things that

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,260
you need to communicate you have to be

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,510
open there and yeah it's doable

00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,210
yeah yeah it's like we heard in last

00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,350
talk it's not just about the technology

00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,540
communication is really vital with these

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:54,220
projects exactly I couldn't subscribe to

00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:56,950
that maybe let me add communication and

00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,520
Trust so I think it's for us it was very

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:03,430
helpful to do that to be really could

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,710
rely on our on our software developers

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,770
and our architects to say ok this is the

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:11,290
right way we want to move and don't

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:14,470
bother them with too many comparisons

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:16,360
too many pieces too many oh please could

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,120
you could you give me some more inside

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,920
why we exactly use this specific product

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,510
and not those out of the twenty other

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:27,670
products trust them and to add as well

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,950
one challenge that we had there is

00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,270
actually a you need a completely

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,630
different skill set of people

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:36,190
that can work on the smack stack so it's

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:39,160
quite challenging to find good people

00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,020
that I actually do the work so that's

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,620
that's really a hard one that's the

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,510
reason why we have an HR booth out there

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,620
for some of you are interested in I mean

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,300
if you found you've been able to train

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,900
some people internally already to get

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,870
them up to speed

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:55,270
yeah that's great and last but not least

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,370
we have to mention that it's not purely

00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:01,210
a technically issue to do this shift

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:05,320
it's mostly a cultural shift necessary

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:07,420
in in big companies and also a shift of

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,490
the work mode of the skills that if

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,300
you've already mentioned so there's lots

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,260
more than pure technology yeah

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,020
wanting to it with regard to

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:20,080
communication I think been yesterday in

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,510
the DC US afternoon had one sentence on

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,500
on its lights which talked about

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:28,300
communication and actually there was one

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,960
subject that you could exchange share

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:34,810
with any kind of yeah with any subject

00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:39,420
but it all came down to communication is

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:42,070
the key yeah that one I really liked all

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,800
right it's the last question I had for

00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,910
all of you is sort of a future looking

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,220
one

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,960
so we're implementing this Mac stack now

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,370
it's running well where do we see the

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,940
smack stack in a few years what is the

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:58,200
smack stack 2.0 do the DAC does the

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:03,700
acronym change what are you thinking

00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:07,209
maybe but for us the important thing for

00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,470
smack stack to do is to get the stuff

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,300
I've already mentioned software-defined

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,690
networking of different stories that

00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,430
that's a would be a good thing and the

00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,070
tight integration of the products

00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,560
together would also be a really a huge

00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:23,410
advantage for us to avoid down times

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,820
while migrating to higher versions and

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,260
things like that and that's that's the

00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,430
components inside the smack stack

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,250
themselves yeah

00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:32,230
integration or the applicate other you

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:36,730
know this mexic itself and each

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:40,090
application within and the other thing

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,740
around is that we have to implement more

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,450
and more components into that stack

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:49,269
regarding

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:52,809
ái capabilities that's one of the

00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:57,220
crucial factors for us to succeed in the

00:17:52,809 --> 00:18:00,070
matters of envisioning environment

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:03,010
building map layers with real-time

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:06,190
events on it to let the car drive on its

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:08,529
own in the future yeah

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,440
it's Mexican I guess will not change I

00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:14,559
can still download lamp probably the

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,620
package still different things in it but

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,470
the label sticks the same I think that

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,090
the a lot of the majority will do will

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,240
be done on the on infrastructure level

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:28,029
like new orchestration frameworks

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:32,370
appearing this is more where I see

00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:32,370
future something's going to change

00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:40,179
looking into the future I hope that

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,159
there will be a smack Enterprise so if

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,559
you really build products that are

00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:45,899
running at your customers you have to

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,909
take HIPAA take care about

00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:52,330
maintainability monitoring security

00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:55,630
aspects encryption at rest and transit

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,049
and if you would like to add all this on

00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,149
your own

00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:04,450
yeah then you actually build this Mac

00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:06,900
Enterprise all right thank you everyone

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:11,229
this is great

00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,229
