	More Bang for Your Buck: How Yelp Autoscales Mesos + Marathon on AWS Spot Fleet - Rob Johnson, Yelp

Yelp was an early adopter of Mesos and Marathon, building PaaSTA, a PaaS that provides an easy way for developers to deploy their services and batches. As we migrated more parts of the infrastructure to run on PaaSTA, we had to figure out how to maximize cluster utilization and minimize costs. In this talk, I'll discuss how Yelp autoscales both services and servers, shuffling tasks around our Mesos cluster to improve utilization, whilst dealing with the extra volatility caused by running on AWS Spot Fleet. I’ll tell stories of outages, strategies for improving resilience against AWS pulling the plug on instances with 2 minutes warning and gracefully migrating services actively serving traffic, and discuss how we decide when to increase and decrease cluster capacity.
