good morning mrs. Khan it's really hard

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,460
to see with all this light but I hope

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:10,230
you're all awake who is awake not not so

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,500
many people I was actually wondering

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,330
what your wishes are so if we had the

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,850
option of either starting earlier and

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,949
having more content more cool town halls

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,230
more missus university sessions or

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,119
starting an hour later and sleep longer

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,130
and therefore have more fun the evening

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,760
before would be for the option of

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,710
sleeping longer about half the people

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,130
and who would actually like to get up

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,170
earlier and learn more at mrs. Khan oh

00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,210
yeah I also have okay so probably we're

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,070
just gonna stick to the schedule in the

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:47,700
middle so to fit kind of both both

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,620
interests here so yesterday was already

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,449
pretty cool day I must actually admit I

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,550
wasn't here at mrs. Khan yesterday

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,649
beaker say what it was it sparked summit

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,379
in Prague but I heard there was a lot of

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,289
great stuff going on the town holds one

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,080
mrs. University session yesterday we had

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,659
C smack track we had an Operations track

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,390
and we had the missiles internal strike

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,490
which usually is my favorite and today

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,310
we will actually continue with this cool

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,200
program so today we have some more talks

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,970
about smack and actually machine

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,369
learning with some pretty cool new

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,470
announcements as well then we have

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,540
another session of the operations track

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,860
and we actually have our frameworks

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,229
track where we going to talk about

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,299
marathon and other frameworks running on

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,189
top so I feel this is a pretty packed

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,520
program so it's good that we're actually

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,990
starting this early but before we get

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,140
