	What Building Multiple Scalable DC/OS Deployments Taught Me About Running Stateful Services on DC/OS - Nathan Shimek, New Context

As a systems integrator specializing in cloud transformation projects, New Context has helped customers run mission-critical applications on DCOS. As part of that work, we’ve overcome a host of challenges that pop up when running stateful services like databases, queues, and key-value stores on top of DC/OS.

DC/OS supports local and external volumes for stateful applications, but there are a number of documented “caveats” that must be overcome like volumes being pinned to hosts, inability to dynamically provision volumes at run time, resource requirements being fixed at task launch, and being limited to one task per volume.

This talk will provide background on the main gotchas of running stateful services on Marathon and DCOS, and will discuss how to overcome them based on real-world projects conducted alongside some of the largest container users in the world.
