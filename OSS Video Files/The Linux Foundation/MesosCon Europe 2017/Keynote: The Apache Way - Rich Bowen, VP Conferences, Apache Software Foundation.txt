Wow so it's it's really an honor to get

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,950
to speak with you today and it's always

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,260
exciting to see the Apache Software

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,469
Foundation grow in ways that we never

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,509
even imagined when when we started it

00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:17,760
and and you know this is one of the

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,740
really exciting projects within the

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,720
foundation I want to talk with you

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,760
briefly about the Apache Software

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,750
Foundation which of course may sauce is

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,510
a part of and there there are things

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,239
that happen within your project that may

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,820
seem a little bit arbitrary and so

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,820
understanding a bit about the the

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,370
foundation and its history is can can be

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,700
really informative as as you see those

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,140
things happen the Apache way that we

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,450
call you know this thing that we call

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,620
the Apache way is a number of things

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:56,039
it's a a governance method it's a way of

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,780
running communities it's a belief that

00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,489
your community is more important than

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,070
your code and so these sorts of

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,640
gatherings are so important to bring

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:09,630
your community together so looking back

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,200
20 years a group of people gathered

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,970
around a piece of source code and

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,560
created this foundation and so here's

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,689
this this picture from our very first

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,759
Apache con in 1998 and they were they

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,380
were specifically scratching their own

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,619
itch they were trying to get something

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:32,790
working that was broken brian behlendorf

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,640
brought this group of people together

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,380
because his web site was running on an

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,560
abandoned piece of software and he

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,460
wanted that to work so he got several of

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,500
his friends together to ensure that they

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,030
could fix the problems but one of the

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,299
things that was very critical to him is

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,240
that whatever software they came up with

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,009
he wanted to be able to use that if he

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,719
moved to another employer he didn't want

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,119
it to be locked in he wanted this to be

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,119
something that was independent from any

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,640
one organization so here's that same

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:12,540
group of people 20 years later at our

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:13,890
reunion party in Maya in Austin and most

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,110
of these people are no

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,900
longer involved in the project but those

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,910
principles that they put in place govern

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,490
how we do things within the foundation

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,580
one of the things that is in our roots

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,209
is this notion of bottom-up leadership

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:34,230
that we lead by example rather than

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:36,930
passing down edicts from the board

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,540
the web server project has grown a

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,540
little bit but what's grown even more is

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,760
the Apache Software Foundation as a

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:50,040
whole we've grown from one project on

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:53,390
day one to now 315 projects as of last

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,390
week's board meeting

00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,560
you know our project the project that I

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,400
started with has grown from those eight

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,440
initial contributors to 118 contributors

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,560
probably a dozen or two that are active

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,980
on any given month and we add new

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,620
members every year just as your project

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,380
adds new members every year the

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,120
principles by which we operate are the

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,420
these are the three most important ones

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,340
in that squinty font up there I wonder

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,590
yeah I need to fix that anyway so

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,709
collaborative decision making is is very

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,860
critical having a flat organization so

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,410
that everyone has an equal voice and

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,959
being able to resolve conflicts without

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,269
destroying relationships pier Giorgio

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,670
gave a great talk yesterday about how

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,910
our governance model allows people to

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,910
disagree violently in public while not

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,290
destroying their personal relationships

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,660
um you know there's a lot of other

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,390
governance models in open-source that

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,350
are perfectly valid but we've chosen a

00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,570
model that reflects Brian's initial

00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:04,140
desires that things were done by

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,880
collaborative decision making now at the

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,680
foundation level we have this this

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,450
mission statement which I imagine that

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,500
you've seen and I am NOT going to read

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,959
to you we have our vision statement but

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,709
the the core parts of this are consensus

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,919
based decision making and ensuring that

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,560
we from the beginning our desire was to

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,389
create reference implementations of

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,539
important technology and

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,699
lead the world by example maysa is one

00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:35,490
of the great examples of how that's

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,949
actually happened you people here have

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,819
created and led an industry that didn't

00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:44,069
exist before you came along the legal

00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,009
structure of the foundation is that we

00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:50,819
have a Board of Directors and the

00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:52,590
membership elects other members and the

00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:54,629
the Board of Governor the Board of

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:59,009
Directors is responsible for the legal

00:04:54,629 --> 00:05:01,469
aspects of the foundation but you know

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:04,979
the ASF exists as a legal entity so that

00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:08,189
we can raise money to do events like

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:11,759
this and Apache con and handle the

00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:14,340
infrastructure needs of our projects but

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,639
we we've created a management structure

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,669
that tries to completely separate

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,639
technical decision-making from

00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:26,009
organizational governance and so the the

00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,229
Board of Directors and the membership

00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,999
that the membership elects the board of

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:33,479
directors to handle the governance

00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:35,789
aspects of the foundation but the board

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,770
stays completely out of the way when it

00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,960
comes to technical decision-making on

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:44,189
projects that's left entirely up to the

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,020
project every once in a while the board

00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:48,629
will step in when a project goes

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,490
seriously off the rails fortunately on

00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:54,569
20 years we've only had to do that twice

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:59,729
and you know it's not something that

00:05:54,569 --> 00:06:02,219
that we take lightly from the project's

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,229
perspective the project should see the

00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:07,259
foundation primarily as a service

00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:10,020
provider we provide infrastructure

00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:13,469
support legal support financial support

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,689
where necessary and and as a as

00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:18,779
mentoring so that those of us that that

00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:22,169
have been around for 20-some years and

00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:24,060
have seen projects that are healthy as

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,460
well as projects that are unhealthy can

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:32,370
maybe offer some advice some guidance

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:34,279
but not not direction by edict projects

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,129
are responsible for their own code

00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:40,589
they're responsible for their internal

00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,160
governance structures so been mentioned

00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:44,070
a moment ago

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,530
that within the maysa project when

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,960
someone is made a committer

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,360
they are also made a PMC member at the

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,490
same time that's something that varies

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,700
greatly from one project to another some

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,380
projects will select committers and then

00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,820
not make them part of the project

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,540
management committee until possibly

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:07,260
years later and this is something that's

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,310
left up to the project's another core

00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,560
principle that we have at Apache that

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:16,020
some people can see as being

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,000
old-fashioned is the notion that

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,340
everything has to happen on the mailing

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,930
list but there's some very specific

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:27,180
reasons why we have done this one is to

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,630
ensure that there are no private

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,420
conversations around important project

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,150
decisions this all all in the open

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,630
complete transparency so that you don't

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:42,780
have decisions about your project

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,330
happening in the boardroom at mesosphere

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,700
that's that's not allowed and and

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,340
because we have companies like Mesa

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,160
sphere that understand this your project

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,950
can be healthy and community led it's

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,320
also to ensure that people who are not

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,560
in your time zone and don't speak your

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,530
language can participate as equal people

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,400
on your mailing list out-of-band

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:11,700
they can they can translate they can

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:15,900
participate in a another time zone it

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:18,780
doesn't have to be synchronous we chose

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,610
open source at the very beginning of the

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:25,470
project because we wanted to ensure that

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,570
there was no vendor lock-in that

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,490
projects controlled their own distant

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:34,680
destiny and were not controlled by a

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:38,640
corporation and that there was direct

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,860
user input that you don't you don't tend

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,130
to get when decisions are made in closed

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,010
source projects out of that came the

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,900
apache license which codified some of

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:54,360
these things it was based directly on

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:56,790
the MIT and BSD licenses and the

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,670
also further insured that not only were

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,739
projects independent but that companies

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,600
could then take that code and build

00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:05,220
their businesses on top of it so we've

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,850
been we've tried to be very business

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,790
friendly from the very early days and as

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,559
a result of this you see apache code in

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,899
absolutely everything so if you look

00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:19,439
where that red line is you'll see apache

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,730
this is the the load screen of minecraft

00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:22,679
I just you know picked something

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,360
randomly here but every time you run

00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,429
minecraft you'll see that it's using

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,759
Apache Commons libraries under the hood

00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:31,860
and that's because we've created we've

00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,670
used this licensing model that allows

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,739
this to be used absolutely everywhere so

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,119
the Apache way works because we believe

00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:43,259
very strongly in individual merit

00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,899
individuals come to our project as

00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,879
individuals they grow in the communities

00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:51,600
trust and appreciation and then they're

00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:53,790
given the reigns transparency allows our

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,129
projects to be developed completely in

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,489
the open ensuring that everyone can

00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:01,169
contribute on an equal playing field and

00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:03,329
we believe that great software is an

00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:06,269
emergent property of great communities

00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:09,720
and therefore we place community health

00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:12,329
even over the Software's health when we

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,489
evaluate a project as the board we're

00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:18,389
concerned primarily about the health of

00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:20,879
the community and less so about the code

00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:23,730
quality because that's up to the project

00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:27,019
themselves and we believe that the

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:30,029
results of this our vendor neutrality

00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,279
increased diversity of projects which is

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:35,369
something that we continue to strive

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,949
towards that that the software that's

00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:41,819
produced can be trusted and safe and

00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:43,949
that the the best ideas are what wins

00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:47,189
rather than the people with the loudest

00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:50,699
voice so you can propose your ideas you

00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:56,249
can turn them into code and you can vote

00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:59,009
with your commits the concept of merit

00:10:56,249 --> 00:11:00,959
has also been very core to to the way

00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,449
that our communities evolve over the

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,899
years and this is another place where

00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:08,160
projects determine independently what

00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,110
merit means whether

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,230
it means number of commits or a code

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:16,889
quality or the value the quality of your

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:19,680
ideas but it's important to remember

00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:22,649
that it's not just code that matters

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,600
within projects it's people that write

00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,839
documentation it's people that put on

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,199
conferences people that design your

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,290
logos and your websites and all of these

00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:38,209
things are equally important to the

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,209
health and longevity of projects

00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:44,220
community over code is one of our

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,959
sayings and it's shorthand for saying

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,209
that the community matters more than the

00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:50,670
code a sustainable community leads to

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,709
code that you can depend on but good

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:56,600
code all by itself isn't sustainable

00:11:52,709 --> 00:12:00,420
because the world changes every day

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,240
collaborative development is another way

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,459
that ensures that projects are

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,339
sustainable and are not simply the work

00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:13,139
of one person that could decide to go

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:15,209
work on something else tomorrow now I

00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,100
mentioned earlier that there are some

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:19,319
things in the governance of your project

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,600
that may seem a little bit weird when

00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:23,189
you first come to it and these I hope

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,750
that that showing you some of the

00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:27,680
history of where the foundation came

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:31,199
from will explain some of those things

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,139
people that come to apache projects from

00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:36,779
elsewhere in the open-source world have

00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:39,750
this cons have this notion that apache

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,399
has way too many rules too much too much

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,959
too many restrictions and you know we

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,339
hear this from a lot of projects

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:50,459
particularly as they go through the

00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:53,339
incubator and so you know once again I

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:56,459
hope that I've helped explain some of

00:12:53,339 --> 00:13:01,980
those things we we have very few actual

00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:04,949
rules we have rules around how you use

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,930
our trademarks because that's really all

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:08,939
the foundation owns is our trademarks

00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,699
and so we we hold on to those and we

00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:15,360
protect the value of those not just to

00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:17,850
have something but so that we can be

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,100
trusted so that when people see the

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,779
Apache mark on a project they know that

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,990
that stands for something they know that

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:27,029
stands for quality and Trust so that's

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,220
very important to us to protect correct

00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:33,319
usage of our trademarks so that is a

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,319
place where we have quite a few rules

00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:39,329
but beyond that we really don't like to

00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,550
and we the board don't like to interfere

00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:47,040
on the way that projects manage

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:49,230
themselves we do as I said require that

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,779
all projects conduct their business on

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,610
mailing lists most projects have at

00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:56,339
least a user and developer mailing list

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,180
there's also a private mailing list that

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:02,550
the project management committee can

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,860
talk on about issues that are sensitive

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,499
such as electing new members to the

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,689
project however the board keeps a

00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:11,670
lookout on these private lists and tends

00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:13,949
to scold projects that have discussed

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:17,360
discussions on the private list that

00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:19,949
should really be public and transparent

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,699
so what do we control we control our

00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:26,100
trademarks we ensure that projects

00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:28,230
operate in a vendor neutral way and are

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,800
not being controlled by a particular

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:34,259
company or organization and we protect

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,750
the provenance our of our code which is

00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:39,779
a fancy way of saying that we try to

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,430
ensure that we don't have code in our

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:45,959
releases that you're going to get sued

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:47,459
for we do have a number of non-coding

00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,110
teams within the Apache Software

00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,480
Foundation and these can be thought of

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:55,339
as services that we as the foundation

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:59,360
offer to projects we do offer

00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:02,250
infrastructure for all of our projects

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,019
we don't require that projects use our

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:08,399
infrastructure but it's available there

00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:10,379
when projects want it we offer public

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,199
relations and travel assistance to

00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:15,240
events if you want to bring people to to

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,730
maces Khan and they can't afford to get

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,800
there you contact the travel assistance

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:23,309
committee and we have funds to help that

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:27,740
happen we provide legal and trademark

00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:31,529
services and we provide fundraising and

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,079
we have a table out here in the foyer

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:35,490
where we've got community development

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,480
people that

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:41,339
helped do community type activities

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,640
nearly everybody that works at the

00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:46,680
foundation does so as a volunteer we

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,600
have many of us have very generous

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,510
employers that let us spend our time

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,600
speaking at events traveling to events

00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:57,120
and working on a patchy code we do have

00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,800
a few paid people we have paid

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:05,970
infrastructure support we have a paid

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,860
marketing department now when you all

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,050
came to the foundation you came through

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,300
the Apache Incubator so this is the main

00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:15,870
way that projects enter the ink into the

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:18,830
foundation at the moment we have 60

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:23,250
projects that are in the incubator and

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:25,110
these projects are projects that have

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,270
come from somewhere else and want to

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,630
participate in what we have to offer at

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:34,110
the foundation they are learning how to

00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:36,959
run as an Apache project and also during

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:39,240
that process we ensure that their code

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,250
can in fact be released under the terms

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,630
of the Apache Software license

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:49,860
legally there are many many ways that

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:52,079
people can contribute to the foundation

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,430
here's just a short list of them of

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,589
course most of the people that

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,450
participate in projects are writing

00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:00,740
source code but all of these other

00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:04,709
activities are equally important and

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:08,579
ensure that projects keep keep moving

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:10,949
along one of the things that's built

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,949
into the DNA of the foundation is

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:15,870
mentorship so this this attractive

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,280
gentleman here is Ken core he's the

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,559
person that mentored me into the

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,750
foundation all those years ago by

00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:24,089
encouraging me to do things that I

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,480
didn't think I had the ability to do

00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:28,800
like public speaking for example

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,700
mentoring is built into how the

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:35,010
incubator works and it's also built into

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,370
the committer and PMC and project

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:43,290
relationship as you know more implicitly

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:46,070
that that the existing members of a

00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:50,629
community bring on new contributors and

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,799
teach them the ways of the project

00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:55,139
now finally I want to mention how

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,539
organizations can contribute to the

00:17:55,139 --> 00:18:00,149
Apache Software Foundation you all

00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:02,669
represent a large number of companies

00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:04,919
that oh your existence to the mesas

00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:07,139
codebase and there are many ways that

00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,899
your organization can help the health

00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:15,210
and success of mesas as well as the

00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:18,149
larger Apache Software Foundation your

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,609
your companies have generously sent you

00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:24,720
here and they pay for your time to work

00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:26,399
on the code companies can also sponsor

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,710
the foundation if your company is

00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:31,169
interested in any way in sponsoring the

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,379
Apache Software Foundation come see me

00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:37,519
afterwards and I can I can give you the

00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:40,830
details of how that actually operates

00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:43,169
these are some of the organizations that

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:46,409
sponsor the Apache Software Foundation

00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:48,629
these are our platinum sponsors and each

00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:52,739
one of these organizations sponsors the

00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:55,710
foundation at $100,000 a year there are

00:18:52,739 --> 00:19:00,179
also other levels of sponsorship all the

00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:03,179
way down to sponsoring us by giving 5%

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,359
of your amazon.com purchases to the

00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:12,659
foundation so there's there's a variety

00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:16,259
of ways to sponsor there are many

00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:18,179
reasons that companies sponsor the

00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:23,669
Apache Software Foundation and other

00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:27,600
open-source foundations and the you know

00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:29,340
motivations vary greatly people want to

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,019
sponsor the foundation for altruistic

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,999
reasons because they see that we're

00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:36,690
doing good things in the world that we

00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:39,629
have we have projects that make the life

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:42,239
better for people and so they want to

00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:44,580
give back a little bit of what they're

00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:46,739
using the value that they've that they

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,049
get from that software they want to give

00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:51,350
back so there's altruism there's also

00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:53,820
the practical and forward-thinking

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:57,019
aspects of companies that understand

00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:01,109
that their business model depends on the

00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:03,090
on the health of these projects and so

00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:05,130
they sponsor the foundation

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,250
to ensure that their business model will

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,170
continue into the coming years and these

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,060
are the kinds of sponsors that were

00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,200
particularly interested in because they

00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:18,360
they understand that if they don't

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,880
contribute to the health of this

00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,130
organization that a couple years from

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,680
now these projects are no longer going

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,750
to be around and then of course we also

00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,860
have people that that sponsor us because

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,450
we link to them on our sponsorship page

00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:38,760
which is an ongoing debate within the

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:42,630
fundraising team at this time the

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,210
majority of fund is that we take into

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,220
the foundation go directly to

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,250
infrastructure support this is to run

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,010
the source repositories the mailing

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,410
lists the CI infrastructure the web

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:58,770
infrastructure and on and on and on the

00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:01,040
the various infrastructure needs and the

00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:04,290
next biggest piece of the pie is

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,760
publicity and marketing followed by

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:12,510
legal services like brand management and

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,040
various other administrative costs so
