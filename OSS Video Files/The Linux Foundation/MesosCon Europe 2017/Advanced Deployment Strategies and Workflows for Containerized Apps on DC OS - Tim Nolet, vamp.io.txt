	Advanced Deployment Strategies and Workflows for Containerized Apps on DC/OS - Tim Nolet, vamp.io

DC/OS container orchestration on Mesos is a powerful tool already embraced by many teams across many enterprises. After taking this first step towards containerized workloads, teams are confronted with complex and time intensive deployment and release requirements; canary releasing, zero downtime, constant health tracking and roll backs to known states.

This talk deep dives into different deployment and release patterns, how they can help in real life scenarios and how you can code these using Vamp’s advanced automation workflows. I’ll show how to integrate these patterns into typical CI/CD tools like Jenkins and provide Node.js based workflow examples how you can use live metrics and health statistics to influence a deployment’s course dynamically.
