	Marathon and Jobs - Today and Tomorrow, Johannes Unterstein, Mesosphere, Inc.

Marathon and Chronos have been the core and essential frameworks for most Apache Mesos clusters. Marathon ensures long running tasks are running in the datacenter and is commonly used to maintain high availability of other frameworks. Chronos is the fault tolerant cron of the datacenter. Not long ago, Mesosphere introduced Metronome as a replacement for Chronos based on the Marathon code base. There has been significant change in Marathon to leverage the latest features of Apache Mesos, shift the framework to a reliable and stable state and improve its overall performance and scalability. This session will provide an overview of all the new features, a reasoning about how and why Marathon will grow, and will conclude with a look at the roadmap for Marathon in particular and frameworks launched via Marathon in general.
