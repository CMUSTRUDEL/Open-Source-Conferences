Description: 
	Container Networking for Micro-Services: An Apache Mesos Networking Deep Dive - Jörg Schad & Deepak Goel, Mesosphere, Inc.

Apache Mesos and DC/OS allows users to deploy distributed applications and in particular micro-services across a large cluster. Therefore, networking becomes an important aspect especially when trying to provide highly-available applications on top of an unreliable infrastructure.
In this talk, we will first present the various challenges around networking for distributed micro-service architectures, including
* Connectivity
* Service Discovery
* Load-balancing
* Isolation

As for most of the above challenges there is not a one-size-fits-all solution we have an in-depth look at the trade-offs between different solutions. 
Afterwards, we will deep dive into the actual implementation of the different components in order to understand how we can achieve a scalable networking
