Description: 
	Using External Persistent Volumes to Reduce Recovery Times and Achieve High Availability on DC/OS - Dinesh Israni, Portworx Inc

Most modern distributed applications like Cassandra and HDFS provide replication of data across nodes and failure zones to be able to deal with failures. But the time taken to recover to a pre-failure level of redundancy in cases of permanent node failures can be large, since a lot of data needs to be copied over to the new node. Also, some of these applications cannot accept new writes on the nodes being bootstrapped, further increasing the recovery time. 

Dinesh Israni will talk about how you can use dcos-commons frameworks for Cassandra, Elasticsearch, HDFS, Kafka and Spark along with External Persistent volumes to reduce recovery times for your distributed applications and achieve high availability for applications that donâ€™t provide replication.
