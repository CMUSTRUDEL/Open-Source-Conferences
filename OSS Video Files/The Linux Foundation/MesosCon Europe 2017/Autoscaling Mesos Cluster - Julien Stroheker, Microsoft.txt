About Julien Stroheker
Hi! I am Julien Stroheker and I am working at Microsoft as a Software Developer Engineer on DevOps. I like talking and sharing about how Dev and Ops can be better together and work as a strong team. From a Ops background profile, I am trying to become a better developer to have a thorough understanding about this DevOps thing.
