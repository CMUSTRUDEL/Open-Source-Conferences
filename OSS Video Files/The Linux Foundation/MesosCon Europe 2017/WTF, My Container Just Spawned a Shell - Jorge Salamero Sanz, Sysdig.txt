	WTF, My Container Just Spawned a Shell - Jorge Salamero Sanz, Sysdig

While there have been many improvements around securing containers, there is still a large gap in monitoring the behavior of containers in production. Thatâ€™s why we created Sysdig Falco, the open source behavioral activity monitor for containerized environments and works great on Mesos too!!

Sysdig Falco can detect and alert on anomalous behavior at the application, file, system, and network level. In this session get a deep dive into Falco:
- How does behavioral security differ from existing security solutions like image scanning?
- How does Falco work?
- What can it detect? Building and customizing rules
- Next steps

About Jorge Salamero
Jorge enjoys monitoring all the things, from his container clusters to writing sensors plugins and DIY projects with Raspberry PI and ESP8266. 

Currently he is part of the Sysdig team, and in the past was one of the promoters of HumanOps. When he is away from computers, you will find him walking with his 2 dogs across the countryside or driving his car through a twisted road.
