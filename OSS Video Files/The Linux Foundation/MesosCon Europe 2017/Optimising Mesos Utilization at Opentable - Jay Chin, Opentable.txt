	Optimising Mesos Utilization at Opentable - Jay Chin, Opentable

I will provide an overview of how Mesos and Singularity is used at Opentable and the operational challenges supporting the various microservices that rely on Mesos. I will describe how we gather useful statistics on Mesos/Singularity and the tools we use (Grafana, Graphite, Elasticsearch, etc) to provide meaningful dashboards and data to users in order to optimise their usage and performance. I will also provide a brief description of the open source tools we have written for gathering statistics out of Mesos and building dashboards.
