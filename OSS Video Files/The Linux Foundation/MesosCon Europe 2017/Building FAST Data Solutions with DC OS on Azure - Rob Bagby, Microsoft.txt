Description: 
	Building FAST Data Solutions with DC/OS on Azure - Rob Bagby, Microsoft

In this session, we will illustrate how to develop, deploy and manage FAST data solutions at scale on DC/OS and Azure. We will discuss the challenges of stateful containers in the cloud and provide guidance on how to implement both Cassandra and Kafka in DC/OS. We will further discuss how to manage your deployed solution with a partner solution. This session will be demo heavy, illustrating how to develop Cassandra and Kafka applications locally, run them at scale in DC/OS and manage them with a 3rd party workflow solution.
