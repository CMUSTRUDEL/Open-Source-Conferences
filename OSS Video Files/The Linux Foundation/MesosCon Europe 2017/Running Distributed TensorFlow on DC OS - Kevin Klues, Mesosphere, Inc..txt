Description: 
	Running Distributed TensorFlow on DC/OS - Kevin Klues, Mesosphere, Inc.

Running distributed TensorFlow is challenging, especially if you want to train large models on your own infrastructure. In this talk, Kevin Klues and Sam Pringle will present an open source TensorFlow framework for distributed training on DC/OS. This framework addresses several challenges associated with distributed TensorFlow, and they hope it will make life much easier for anyone doing machine learning with large models/datasets. Kevin will introduce TensorFlow on Mesos and DC/OS, and Sam will give a live demo of the framework.
