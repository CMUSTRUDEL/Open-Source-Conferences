	Containerization in Mesos, Embracing the Standards - Jie Yu, Mesosphere, Inc.

Containers are now everywhere. Apache Mesos, as one of the most powerful container orchestrators, greatly simplifies the deploy, provision, and execution of containerized workloads. In this talk, Jie will talk about the evolution of container technology in Mesos. In particular, how Mesos embraces the industry standard for container networking, storage and image specification, and how Mesos achieves that by using a pluggable and extensible architecture. The first part of this talk will give you an overview of the container technology in Mesos and how it has evolved over the years. Then, we will dive into three specific areas in the container technology: networking, storage and image provisioning, and the three industry standards that Mesos is adopting: CNI (Container Network Interface), CSI (Container Storage Interface) and OCI (Open Container Initiative) image spec.
