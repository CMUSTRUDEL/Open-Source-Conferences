	Fault Domains in Mesos - Vinod Kone, Mesosphere, Inc.

While Mesos itself is highly fault tolerant, the apps running on top of it traditionally had to depend on non-standard mechanisms (e.g., agent attributes) to make them highly available. This changes with the introduction of native support for fault domains in Mesos 1.4! Fault domains, as a first class primitive, allows Mesos frameworks to speak a common language when it comes to their desire to launch fault tolerant applications.

This talk will give an overview of the feature and also discusses a few of the use cases this feature unlocks for a lot of organizations. Specifically we will discuss workload bursting from on-prem to public cloud instances and doing rack aware scheduling for stateful applications.
