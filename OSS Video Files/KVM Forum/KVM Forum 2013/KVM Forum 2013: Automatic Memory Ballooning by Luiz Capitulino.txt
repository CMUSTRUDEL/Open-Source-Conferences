When a Linux host is running out of memory, the kernel will take action to reclaim memory. This action may be detrimental to KVM guests performace (eg. swapping). To help avoiding this scenario, a KVM guest could automatically return memory to the host when the host is facing memory pressure. By doing so the guest may also get into memory pressure so we also need a way to allow the guest to automatically get memory back. This is what the automatic ballooning project is about. In this talk Luiz will dive into the project's implementation, challenges and discuss current results.
