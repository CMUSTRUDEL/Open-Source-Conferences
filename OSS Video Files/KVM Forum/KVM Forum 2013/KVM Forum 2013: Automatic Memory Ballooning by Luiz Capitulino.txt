Title: KVM Forum 2013: Automatic Memory Ballooning by Luiz Capitulino

When a Linux host is running out of memory, the kernel will take action to reclaim memory. This action may be detrimental to KVM guests performace (eg. swapping). To help avoiding this scenario, a KVM guest could automatically return memory to the host when the host is facing memory pressure. By doing so the guest may also get into memory pressure so we also need a way to allow the guest to automatically get memory back. This is what the automatic ballooning project is about. In this talk Luiz will dive into the project's implementation, challenges and discuss current results.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
I work for red hat as a software

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:11,280
engineer and today a family with all

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:14,250
automatically this is our end up for

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,730
debate for a filibuster our introduction

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,220
the balloon driver is about how may stop

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,840
lomatic and after that I am going to

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:32,009
talk about that show you some numbers so

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:35,910
long driver give you namely linux and

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,940
windows gas at special driver for the

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:43,140
balloon driver this mechanism in school

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:46,950
and operation they are all in this late

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,050
in place to the team memory from the gas

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,899
and giving to the host divorces youth

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,770
and you take the process of getting the

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,949
death and sorry about give to the guy

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:03,420
for the gas use and the bubbles are also

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:07,080
part is reporting but you're not going

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:11,490
to talk about that today so let's see a

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:15,119
room two examples how's it working x

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,170
very simplified exam so let's talk about

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,229
like fur so you also have a heart yet

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,600
and watch this one isn't that I can give

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,210
to the post what would you do you both

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,170
at the end you open a humor monitor and

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:35,390
your eyes alone three if it's negative

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,390
is what I'm if Rebecca that's for you

00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:42,450
when they kept me reduced to a shrink to

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,670
three years and when he will be given to

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,149
the host so now the host has one

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,070
additional me rephrase on youth now

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:55,049
suppose one to the doc wants take

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,939
memories back to get we do reflect your

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,630
book this again you open a homeowner

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,509
analyze button for eclipse the zoo cause

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,500
the horse to take it from itself and

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,300
give to the gas so the gas grows and

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,720
after that the gas has one additional

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,600
people the desk is expertly and the host

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,230
s1 give

00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,510
so that means list and why would you

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:27,270
want to use this city what is the main

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:32,520
advantage of this future bubblin manage

00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:36,930
Vantage is that it allows you more yes

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,030
your host because when your train sorry

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,400
when you reach the gas when we inflate

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:47,250
its relevance you are making room for

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,530
Margot to run and the very picture you

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,720
want to be able to maximize our

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:57,150
resources duties which includes their m

00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,630
this works is already exists and works

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:06,050
just as I strike but it has a serious

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:10,050
problem it's completely manual so

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:12,990
suppose your trick again and after a few

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,610
minutes you're getting remember because

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:20,850
the station in there are 12 a program

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:24,150
you are not watching then you're getting

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:27,739
me die out of memory so this requires

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:32,610
you to be there what for again and

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:35,940
suppose you have the several oh how can

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,330
you possible you know monitor all your

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,690
gas then operate deflation it feels like

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:49,680
because inflates also required how much

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:54,989
memory and how your business needs how

00:03:49,680 --> 00:04:00,690
much infinite yes so we're going to be

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:03,870
really useful it had the effect it would

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:07,410
be like this when the whole to safety

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:11,010
and fracture is hotel yes you've

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:14,640
memorized the hope and it is possibly

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:18,540
get through ran out of memory then the

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:23,820
guests with all of my voice if we

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,860
deleted that the management of yes gonna

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,610
host with which has its memory of quick

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:33,659
because

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:37,780
Oh Elka message now let's talk about how

00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:40,180
may how we can make ballooning message

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:45,129
I'm going to describe an invitation

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:47,979
which is based on ideas I ribbon and and

00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:52,180
i also got help from a developer oh

00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:55,479
lucky me also they got help from you

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:59,710
guys all implementation decisions and

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:04,210
all but they're all mine all mine also I

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:08,439
know that is this one Roger Hall mom

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:14,080
Emily which tries to solve this in

00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:16,330
problem is going talk about but I have

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,139
been with a few guys like Adam

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:25,360
and arm and we probably can integrate

00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:29,379
the two solution so when we talk about

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,339
making messes we lost 12 moves to

00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:39,190
Aboriginal neck inflation as first off

00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:42,069
inflate how it can be automated recent

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:46,110
Colonel research with thriller sin but a

00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:51,550
new API hold the pressure easy our CI r

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:54,279
memory captain ds easy I notify user

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:58,270
specification when the fennel is running

00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:00,759
out of memory the GI defined really

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:03,879
pressure levels whoa which means that

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:07,240
they're loaded plenty members for

00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:10,539
publications medium which means that the

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:14,319
colonel has our squad for which the

00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:20,610
colonel is out of memory and interior a

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:24,339
ram at any time there are two important

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,169
details about GDP I work it is part of

00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:31,300
the memory controller see group so we

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:34,539
got to support and secondly the

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,899
notifications are gone through event at

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:40,630
least so if you are interested with

00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:45,190
three levels in the three notification

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:48,370
then you have great free even if then

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,920
render them with the third so we're

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,560
everyone for low 14 million and work for

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,040
people we are going to be wiped

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,350
importance is a present an active life

00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:02,560
so this seems to be a very good fish to

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:09,130
know when the host is under memory

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:13,600
factor and that's exactly that would so

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:18,610
q mu is ezgi so cute registers for low

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:21,600
vision and principal and when the whole

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:25,000
city memory pressure give is not fired

00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,910
so we have the opportunity to ask the

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,710
gas inflated balloon by some amount of

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:36,700
people in very statute this some of

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:39,970
these are actually free as i said so we

00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:46,600
have a mega furlough so when swimmer is

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:51,660
not final oh yeah ask the gas inflate by

00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:57,720
women which follows the manga and both

00:07:51,660 --> 00:08:02,290
I'm with mega from and format for with

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:06,010
her infectious this is hardcoded able to

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:08,940
make this a comment line option for you

00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,800
then it should be that way so

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:19,200
implemented that's like this it works

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:25,240
but has a number of problem for it's not

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:31,570
pretty unless it has a door you came so

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:33,550
requires our testing research I have

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:38,140
been talkin to huh file what we could do

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:40,810
to maybe remove this pretty painted rock

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:46,390
I of a year but to instead of having

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:49,420
predefined values we could we could less

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,910
p.m. you just tell the gas that the

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,279
hostess is memory pressure and they have

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,589
to get food try to resist

00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:02,249
they have it's a free pages to the hope

00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:12,430
do you just an idea it's not done yet

00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:14,769
what sorry oh oh yes yes it then the

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:18,970
August are not fired so the question is

00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:22,149
how the host selects like yet to taste

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:25,959
pages from all gases are not fired and

00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:27,610
you try to return pages to the host we

00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,740
are going to see what happens if the gas

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,480
runs out out of memories to it they got

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:36,839
to get some air pressure event see in

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,670
the next life but it's a very precious

00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,670
the other problem which must be using

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:46,180
the colonel API the memory pressure API

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,999
is that if the host is under heavy

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:52,569
memory pressure I think that as many as

00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:55,660
20 and per second which is a lot

00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:59,589
positive to get inflates the balloon by

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:03,519
too much the solution is to implement

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:07,420
rockland which I did and now is events

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,370
are limited to one per second but it

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,910
makes me wonder if it should be done in

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,759
user space for it should be moved to the

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:18,730
car no api some way and the other

00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:23,559
problem which is also would discourage

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:25,569
I've is as if you if you have if you

00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:29,050
have an application and you are

00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:31,660
interested in two notifications into

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,790
lack of like low and medium and you

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,459
register for them and you use different

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,329
identities for this and the kind of gas

00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:43,689
medium pressure then your remote

00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:46,480
identity is also going to slow image and

00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:49,509
if you are selling it three levels which

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,199
is our tape then always even if deserve

00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:54,670
woken up it's as if you do if you want

00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:58,420
to have a different policy for each

00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:02,620
level because graceful all your policies

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:05,230
are going to execute I had a long

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,870
discussion I tried to succeed in the

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:11,350
colonel I had a long discussion with

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,870
american author and i didn't succeed to

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,930
get in my sessions of five and

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:21,270
distillate solution was he suggested to

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:24,400
me to delete flag events in user space

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:27,370
which is usually for this three domestic

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,070
asians and when you get one of them you

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:33,760
decide which one to dispatch which for

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:38,650
medium are or or low implemented it

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,660
doesn't arise i can move for both

00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:44,230
happy because we knew you can't fall

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:47,529
flags have to use some infrastructure

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:51,550
which is very few but it is the code

00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:53,890
didn't gets pretty so I wonder if you

00:11:51,550 --> 00:12:00,040
can maybe keep using the colonel some

00:11:53,890 --> 00:12:04,589
way now about this like this is the

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,589
process of getting memory actually get

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:11,650
the general has this other API call

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:15,760
different API which is not related to

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:19,029
the memory of every guy which available

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,100
for drivers and subsistence oh its

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:27,490
internal to the kernel which implements

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,560
caches so if you have a driver for

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,709
example within the minitek write a

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,589
function called drink potion which knows

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:38,470
how to shrink our cash and your register

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:41,320
is with the curve when the colonel is a

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,810
female refresher it is going to call all

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,380
current function and then you can reduce

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:49,750
your test to refer cash and you return

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,050
memories will occur so this is a good

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,570
fit for us for I'm going to this place

00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,700
because when they get turnovers under

00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:01,839
memory pressure it is going to call

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:07,360
shrink all shrink fun so that's why did

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:11,620
I wrote a shrink until afford a reliable

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,810
driver which it registered when the

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,780
Colonel's other member fresher let's say

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:19,200
that we inflated by too much as much

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,170
more or less the question here ah

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,870
biggest bill

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,829
ran out of memory and this Republican of

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,639
all the balloons driver shrink function

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:33,050
which identity displays a balloon and

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,730
these memories from the equipment used

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:41,170
to the gate it is implemented it works

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:46,579
but has problem the first problem at

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:48,529
this this machine design determine what

00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,240
internal call the stream function its

00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,180
passes the number of stages to the

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,290
excess your driver assistance to return

00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:01,899
to the curb however this value seems to

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:05,570
be hard-coded to 128 stages for a call

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:09,940
which is bad for us because our balloon

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:14,630
can be one gives forgive long and doing

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:17,410
deflate by 120 pages for all makes the

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:20,329
deflation is low and the guest grows

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:23,810
slowly which can cause they get to run

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:27,519
out out of memory another problem which

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:34,269
also get referred to that ultimate

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:44,449
inflate and deflate Kevin intact and a

00:14:34,269 --> 00:15:00,769
lover of Mark tapes cute which also got

00:14:44,449 --> 00:15:04,240
the gas run-up now a simple quick update

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:08,120
on the status what it does describe is

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,670
cemented but if you still expert in

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:15,019
experiment with it I'm doing all of

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:19,880
testing and I have to sublicense is get

00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:24,170
into a veritable days however I posted

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:28,100
it twice extreme as RFC versions I got

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:32,329
feedback from from Rick from Michael

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,910
certain inform it it was very good

00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:38,920
feedback but I need more feedback

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:43,520
so please the next versions if you can

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:47,420
now let's talk about testing how do this

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:50,300
test it I'm going to show you a test

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,660
case and and some numbers refer to that

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,670
like I have someone first lesson has

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,920
been the most difficult part in this

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:01,220
project to me maybe because I'm new to

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,380
this area are many deposits which are

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,200
just before it was difficult to me to

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,870
find the test case which should measure

00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,630
automatically baloney and wouldn't be

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:14,210
artificial eventually is offered

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:18,620
something but i am not one hundred

00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:21,860
percent confident is good enough another

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,420
problem is that we have an truoc

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,070
kilometers right to have the number of

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:30,950
pages to inflate and this way and if you

00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,500
change one of those parameters then you

00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:38,180
can completely change the results of the

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:42,170
test so sometimes it's not clear to me

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:47,830
it's a bad number or median average

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:52,330
would improve isn't because of a problem

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:57,470
my quote are a better answer I I have to

00:16:52,330 --> 00:17:02,660
and that is always very simple we have a

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:09,260
lot of generic method to the bestest

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:12,970
it's like this to a host of Giga hope

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:19,190
right we had the effect there are yes

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:21,350
the end brand is the HGTV test is the

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:26,570
benchmark sorry if I don't have time to

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:29,740
try this thank you so when I started

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:33,050
task is the tu viens juste in peril and

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:39,080
the first p.m. we run sex ed with death

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:40,280
threat discover that the end to be

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,110
pleased we use all the memory

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,140
de-allocation that's assignments with

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,770
which is one gig while this is happening

00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:51,380
that examines either

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:55,160
after a minute this changes the first vm

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:57,980
goes idle and the second vm ran 30 to be

00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:03,440
with sent back this father's memory from

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:07,840
the first vm v after community the

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,730
changes again the first games both back

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,250
Reggie gb with dennis red and the second

00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,960
vm goes either this causes memory from

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,700
the first vm should be swapped in and

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,700
memory from the second theme to be

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:23,020
swapped out we expect that of my

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:26,600
suburban will reduce all the swap and

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:30,710
here are the results for can run average

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:35,380
I tested it with auto body disabled and

00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:45,560
enabled this other runtime didn't change

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:47,600
to drop in the host what better without

00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:54,500
my bologna because the reduction of

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:58,640
almost ten percent when a body's

00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:03,310
innate varlon a profit for the whole top

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:09,140
we also got reduction of 6.5 person so

00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:13,460
you chose that of experience ah swati

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:16,670
min ago and then finally we have these

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:20,780
activities are with which is why the to

00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:25,640
be an evolution for a maximum because

00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:30,380
improvement of 123 person which is

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:34,960
probably used the Egyptian suave oh so

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:38,650
it shows that reduces and simple XP

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:44,870
ultimate ability is showing improvement

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:48,230
and that's dismissed with that URL so

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:52,100
easily stage for the project and there

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,530
is some description and institutional

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:58,760
how it works what I just subscribe here

00:19:54,530 --> 00:20:00,519
and also pointer for my repository for

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:25,089
the tournament in you

00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:29,440
and I am open to questions I tried happy

00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:31,989
so I in the driving the video balloon

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:37,329
driver I returned mart and I was asked

00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:42,459
for it was difficult for me to you know

00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:44,559
have a conclusion on this in this case

00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:48,909
I'm not mistaken it didn't prove a

00:20:44,559 --> 00:21:34,119
little bit that wasn't too much so we

00:20:48,909 --> 00:21:37,779
wondering if it's something else your

00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:41,440
eyes that you may first try to test this

00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:43,389
I it's just that I generate too much

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,299
pressure which wouldn't measure anything

00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:51,099
and I struggle with that far for some

00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:53,019
time but at the same time what I have

00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:58,959
observed in my testing is that when the

00:21:53,019 --> 00:22:05,340
gas swap the sexy gb softwoods goes down

00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:09,150
the roof this video because you know

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,570
maybe Thank You mr. interval furnace but

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:19,100
uh then conclusion what that the guests

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:19,100
can swap because the preference goes on

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,700
well if you'll have your test is to

00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:59,030
share with me at me very happy to to try

00:22:29,700 --> 00:23:02,580
them mark election in a bucket started

00:22:59,030 --> 00:24:10,170
the microphone is in the back can't

00:23:02,580 --> 00:24:14,780
really come here I am after all fine yep

00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,780
looking after for fun the guy

00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:57,470
so it almost have mystery fine yeah yeah

00:24:53,159 --> 00:25:01,049
then and that's interesting point cloud

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,809
maybe up with a play that flute to that

00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:09,330
far we only need a better way to deplane

00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:17,220
if you play special and uh yeah we have

00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:20,480
to work yep that's the point Marcus and

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,480
the lesson

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:27,730
nope because the bottom of it because

00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:29,890
there we ran out of time and think you

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:35,820
talk about it says we are going to see

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:35,820
