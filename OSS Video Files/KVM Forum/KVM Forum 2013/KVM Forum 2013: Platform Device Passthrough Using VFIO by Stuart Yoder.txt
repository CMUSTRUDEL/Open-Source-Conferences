VFIO provides a framework for securely allowing user space applications to
directly access and use I/O devices, including QEMU which allows pass-
through of devices to virtual machines. QEMU and the upstream Linux kernel
currently support VFIO for PCI devices.  System-on-a-chip processors frequently
have I/O devices that are not PCI-based and use the platform bus framework
in Linux.  An increasing number of QEMU/KVM users have the need to pass
through platform devices to virtual machines using VFIO.

This presentation describes:
- vfio
- how VFIO-based passthrough of PCI devices is similar and different for platform devices
- issues and challenges in solving platform device pass-through
- proposed kernel changes to enable this
