okay welcome to my second over the lobby

00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:16,800
that stop ok so first who said i'm penka

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:20,560
first I am a software engineer this is

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,430
what I do I work with credit for

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,430
five years

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,220
and what I do on my daily basis is

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,529
working on the

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,529
over Romania

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:42,690
and I'm like to know do you guys anyone

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:48,990
here knows about the old

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,990
yeah you guys try to keep a languid yeah

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,489
and without clothes

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,980
so what am I going to go along so first

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,979
time that I talked a little about them

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,550
I'm going to give in production what is

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,280
cloudy and how does it for and how you

00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,880
can use it i wouldn't give also

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,990
introduction to over and i will go a

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,650
little deeper to over a detective and so

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,200
it will be the base for a

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,280
later on

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,630
limitation

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,330
so integrating cloudy and over and I

00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:37,100
would give an example of how you can how

00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:41,380
cloudy is working with

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:44,620
azizam in within

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,920
that I'm go about what else is needed

00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,920
this

00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,580
so cloudy by definition it invokes earth

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,290
the initialization of cloud instances

00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,250
what it means is that cloud me is the

00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,350
service grants

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,540
with our machines when the virtual

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:07,649
machines Club instance is actually a

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,830
virtual machines and I also call it vm

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:16,450
in a short so and when the vm boots club

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:21,220
the club in service runs and what he

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:25,360
does it look for some in user data that

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:28,510
is a provided from the cloud provider so

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,020
for example the ec2 and metadata and

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:35,470
service you can see the things here if

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,770
you have instance running in a legacy to

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,350
you can get this URL from the Indian

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,130
stinson see some instant specific

00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:48,640
metadata about the instances instance a

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:52,080
day and some information and the other

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,620
one the user data is a way to pass a

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,890
user costume information into the

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,650
instance an open stock is something

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,290
similar and they call it the conflict

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,890
right and basically in the same way to

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:13,060
pass a user data user custom data into

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,730
the VM and gives me a garage attached to

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,090
the mia and it's important to say that

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:24,340
this data is instant specific every vm

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:28,600
has a different user data the street on

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,850
a creation so what do you do with it

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,490
what is this

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:37,110
initialization so basically anything you

00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:39,720
would like to do and when you first put

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,510
into your new creative instance if it's

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,600
setting the first name and the root

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:49,620
password and other simple stuff like

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,450
okay time zone and also some more

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,600
advanced things like network

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:58,950
configuration a virtual interface a

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:03,810
configuration if it's easy p your study

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:07,080
guide be a better stuff like ssh keys

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,710
that allows and connecting to the vm

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:14,400
without hearing the wood password so

00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:17,280
this is really good one you can just

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,400
post the ssh into the instance it would

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,480
have it separating and users could look

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,740
into it using your ssh key and the most

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,720
important thing is running a user custom

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,139
scripts basically to whatever you want

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,930
install software

00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:41,229
other configuration and create files

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:44,029
manage things inside the air and go back

00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:47,749
so this is the fun part how to use it

00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:51,650
and this is very easy actually and first

00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:53,469
we have to have on your a base image or

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:58,550
template depends on your cloud provider

00:04:53,469 --> 00:05:01,310
and some linux distribution installed

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:06,500
and many distributions they are

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:09,289
supported by cloud me fado home to

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,500
weather settles in and so on it's a

00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:16,729
popular lady and once we have this you

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:20,029
only have to install glodny on it is as

00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:24,589
simple as young as dog growling and you

00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:28,099
have it and once you have this base

00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:31,069
image distantly just creative end of it

00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:33,800
create a new instance of it started with

00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:37,639
a specific user data the specific

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,759
configuration that you a want to run the

00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:43,909
vm and clothing it will greatest any

00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,939
configuration and we execute all the

00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:51,740
configuration according to the

00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:51,740
to the specific in distribution

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:59,520
okay so how does it work inside just a

00:05:56,219 --> 00:06:02,819
little and because I'm going to mention

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,400
this thing's dead wrong so as I said

00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:10,699
community service and it starts when the

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:13,080
vm boots and it first looked in his

00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:17,960
configuration in the cloud config file a

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:22,169
what data sources and it should a ring

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:25,990
there is a sample this how it looks like

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:29,830
the data source list so

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:33,580
as an example with no blood pumping

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,230
drive by default it looks for and what I

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:40,240
showed you before the ec2 Megha beta

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:43,000
service the user data assuming is some

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,720
data source was found and increase all

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,300
the configuration from me and executed

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,230
according to the specific distribution

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,160
so there is very distribution and

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,950
implementation of some comments because

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,390
there are difference like selling

00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,770
hostname

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,490
Fedora's different peoples the

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,490
qualifications

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:10,729
so so far and on clothing any questions

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,719
what Carly

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:18,139
great Oh so what is opened from the

00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:20,150
beginning by definition is a large-scale

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:23,629
centralized management for server and

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:26,809
desktop utilization what it means is

00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:29,839
that this is an open source platform for

00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:32,360
virtualization for data center

00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,099
virtualization it provides a good

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,629
alternative for vsphere and vcenter

00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:42,379
economic and poverty has focused on kvm

00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:46,129
on kvm feature is tailored for it and

00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:50,419
the adventure advantages of the kvm

00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:54,860
features and it also focus on ease of

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:58,009
use and deployment so if you saw our

00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:00,649
booth and yesterday you could see a

00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:03,879
really simple day only one installation

00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:07,399
that was locking just like five minutes

00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,039
so environments you can be blowing over

00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:13,159
you can have the simple one post one

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:16,550
datacenter and run few games on this

00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:18,830
host this is good for evaluating over if

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,670
it's good for you one of the feature out

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:25,540
look like how he's always easy to use it

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:29,080
also good for demos and private messages

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:32,870
and of course oh we can grow and have

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,990
more new data center in multi quality

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:39,080
cluster cluster is it over is the

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,190
migration so all the ends in a cluster

00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,890
can migrate live migrate between costs

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:53,150
and basically over can manage a many

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:57,590
data centers and many clusters so the

00:08:53,150 --> 00:09:01,910
overt and present three ways of looking

00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:04,520
at it play ways to use it first you can

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,780
see on the screen and screenshot of the

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:13,820
use of hope this is a basic portal that

00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:16,010
provides the basic actions simple user

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,460
it can do with the system basically is

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,209
just look what we as I have and I can

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,300
stop and stop them and I can

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:26,970
back to them some information on the

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,769
side above the vm a what operation

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,079
system and memoir and stuff like that

00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:35,579
and that's it this is the simple user

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:37,800
all you need is here and for advanced

00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:40,139
user what we call perusal we have the

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,399
same provision in court on this proton

00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:47,670
and in addition provides ways to create

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:52,290
vm provision UVM's and create templates

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:55,850
and manage them so it's like a simple

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:59,939
administrator up it allows a more

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:04,160
power for music and of course we have

00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:08,040
the app instead of hotel this is the

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:12,389
full administration importa the written

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:15,839
administrator needs in order to manage

00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:18,869
their standards manage a host storage

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,439
and network configuration in creating

00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:26,429
virtual machines in users permission

00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:28,200
everything is here this is i'm going to

00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:35,400
show you

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:37,980
oh so high driven and tiptoe over first

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,260
we have the engine the engine is a java

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,220
application the transfer cables and

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:47,970
basically a most of a decision making

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:51,060
and business logic is done there on a

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:56,130
user interaction and all user requests

00:10:51,060 --> 00:11:00,810
of a process in the engine and executing

00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:02,460
and on the metadata configuration is

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,290
safe in the engine so the engine is

00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,080
using a database of course where it is

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:10,890
fosters in order to and save these

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,530
configurations or GMA arena and we also

00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:17,720
use some kind of end observable for a

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,720
user authentication so

00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:27,690
other end up settings on the other hand

00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:30,480
we have a rest api for a integration

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:33,780
with other components for scripting and

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,850
stuff like that and where of course the

00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,420
web class did I just show you the free

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:43,860
web clients and vitamin today also java

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:48,030
sdk NCI for extensions for use of

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:52,080
students and so on so the engine a works

00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:56,250
with the hosts so we have a cost on the

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:59,310
host windows agent we call it VD sm the

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,890
video sam is responsible for all costs

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:06,200
level configuration if its connection to

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:09,720
storage is its network configuration and

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:13,910
the video sentence using liver to

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,910
manipulate GM starting stopping via

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:23,190
and we also use a month project for

00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:29,880
scheduling if it's the ballooning and

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:34,370
seducers VM images discs of the VMS are

00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:38,430
safe on local storage if it's a one host

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:41,640
sir and for multiple hosts we sleep we

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:48,410
use shared storage so shirt storage can

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:52,320
be in NHS posix by waste or it can be a

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:56,400
blocked block-based if it's fci study

00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:00,390
and also force glass surface then

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:04,920
finally and most important the VMS run

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:08,149
another cost we also have a gas station

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,149
is lieutenant Python

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,680
which is responsible for a sending

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:17,220
information form with the images and

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,740
outside like applications installed and

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,720
IP and stuff like that they're also

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,380
responsible for strong actions like

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,380
single son

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:32,260
albert is also using SPICE and spices

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:35,410
light to connect to the guest actually

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,810
there is a session today too if you're

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,800
interested and more about that

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,800
over the world

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:47,500
so what we had before coming if that

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,690
took up now that we know about last

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:54,730
night yeah do you mind going to the mine

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:57,910
or I really grippy and above great said

00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:03,450
because she is he was sharing a database

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:06,120
and with the Ovid engine what when

00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,970
speaking in a high level work is always

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,920
residing what happens if you're over

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:16,780
phone calls or whatever it's their way

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,050
to give it a higher bid yeah so over

00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,330
jealous

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:28,050
is a java application over cables so

00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:32,880
there are hea solutions and four tables

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:35,430
and in case it shows it's important to a

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,649
number of that the hosts that actually

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,200
launched the beams of steel authority so

00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:44,510
James aligning and users can a state

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:47,490
where the only downtime is and when a

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:49,709
user tries to create any I'm starting

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:54,000
behind so basically you so request of

00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:57,540
loved one and in your databases also

00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,380
having the hiring them and the database

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:04,140
is possible database there are also

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:08,370
solutions for I available but not inside

00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:10,440
and outside of the engine because the

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,390
point is that did proper dungeon is

00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,920
actually not really that critical I mean

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:18,120
if the Machine the ice to BMS are really

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,860
still running I know but even said that

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:27,480
VMware does it that they have migrated

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:37,350
virtual machine has the center so they

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:41,220
will do that thirdly my dream yes there

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:43,500
is no stood engine but I will not go

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,930
into the door what it means is the

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:50,850
engine runs on a vm higher goodwill

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:53,610
games and it's managed by another hav

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,130
solution so basically gives you high

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,560
availability for the engines all right

00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,930
it will help you have to cast itself

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,730
crashes or something but it allows you

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,750
to migrated machine somewhere else if

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,750
you need to do some maintenance

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:14,970
okay so back to club and what we have to

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:18,149
talk to Ali so over today before today

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,339
had an integration on you with Windows

00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:24,149
history for anyone who doesn't know

00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:26,910
windows sister is basically a way to

00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:29,490
configure Windows viens on wood it

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:32,910
allows to set the windows key that are

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:36,329
set in the Active Directory domain and

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,529
setting times on basically this is it we

00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:41,189
had duration

00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:43,529
for this since the beginning probably as

00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:46,290
you can see it's pretty simple hands on

00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:47,889
the main only for windows beams and this

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:53,709
depends

00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:57,279
a boot of a windows vm and this is what

00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:59,319
we had so now we were missing something

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,290
similar for games this is where plugging

00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:06,100
in cough so let's have an example of how

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:08,860
to use a plug in it with all so first

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,250
what we need to have is temple in order

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:15,750
if we have template

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:19,430
has linux installed in it and we need to

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:22,470
install clogging also in addition today

00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:25,199
to the operation system of course you

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:30,920
can also install any other software like

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,920
the overcast agent another thing that is

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,670
optional step is still in the hand

00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,330
before creating the template and

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:42,990
basically you can do in some unknown

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:45,930
figure and come on the basically step

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:51,120
and some goal for the operation system

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:54,000
to show the first first set up on the

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,440
next book this is lots of related but

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,850
this is nice to know that you feel good

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,660
and then you create a template from

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:07,010
yeah so now we have a template with

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:09,440
fedora and a clothing now we need to

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:12,440
create a vm from this template so how

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,240
does it work over let me ask from the

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:19,690
engine again to create that a vm from

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,690
this tablet

00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:29,950
the engine goes to the database and

00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:34,879
bring all the technical information and

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:37,219
save a new vm in mega it out the

00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:40,190
configuration to the database and in

00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:44,059
addition we need to go to video s m and

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:47,960
s free to create the discs for the game

00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:54,080
and said on the relevance torture and

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:56,029
this is how the clogging looks ok this

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,960
is how cloudiness configuration screen

00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:01,670
looks today hey when running with me so

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,120
now that we

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,730
we know

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,310
and it has fedora inside and only has

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,400
done it and now we need to use so this

00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:16,859
is how we pass on the user data related

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:22,169
before into this so you can see

00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:27,010
the emotions that in network if it's a

00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:29,750
window they specific or no recipe

00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:34,610
dns and

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:38,030
SSH is the dimension to allow connecting

00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:43,480
to the vm widow password time zone and

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:43,480
good password and we go is hidden

00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:49,540
setting of files into the vm so why we

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,540
show

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,180
also how does this one that mean has run

00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,300
again and it fills out of the

00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:01,760
information that he likes in the screen

00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,760
the engine first create is clogging you

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,070
configure I so we have to create the

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:11,000
driving in a way that plugin e knows to

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:13,850
read and looks for then we have the

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,950
schedule mechanism that we look for the

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,730
best host they according to the schedule

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:21,470
and policy to start this v n1 and once

00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,340
we happened we asked for video sent

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:27,389
Chris Christian for us in it start

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:31,940
diseases inhibitor breaking

00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:35,279
xml and we have TMO process with RPM

00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:39,629
hopefully with the club in a running

00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:43,440
inside so what do we do for this

00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:46,289
implementation to walk and on the overt

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,389
side we used an existing feature that is

00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:51,479
called gameplay dome given payload

00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:55,529
basically allows user to inject funds

00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:59,309
into the vm and use it as a civil war or

00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:03,599
floppy so you can see an example and

00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:06,869
here's a chin rest api a basically you

00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:09,570
can see the bagel type CD on this is

00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:12,179
defining and only one part was supported

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,219
some content and that's it when you run

00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:19,799
the vm despite with way to the sea

00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:24,989
tomorrow other stuff that we have to do

00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:27,719
is to create a specific and cd-rom drive

00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:31,070
it's called the name has to be conceived

00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:34,320
as to and organize all the information

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:37,919
inside the serum in a way cloudy with

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,440
3a allows some steel some stuff that

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,860
over does in addition to actually

00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,720
configure plugging to extend so first

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,870
nominee has something that we call

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:52,049
instrum same and basically every

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:54,149
configuration as a 19 in although for

00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:56,669
cloud you need to know that already then

00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:58,200
okay so if you run the pier on the next

00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:00,630
time I don't amount of the configuration

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,230
to London but if the user want

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:09,750
specifically to run clothing it again so

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:12,360
we set in your ID for parent and as I

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:15,289
said we are setting the data source

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:19,950
configuration the data sources who has

00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:22,440
no cloud and drug and so clothing it

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,419
will not look so the metadata service

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,639
because we don't have it in order it's

00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:32,129
only four is two and the most important

00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:35,639
inside it right we have any two parts

00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:38,490
one is the metadata JSON file it

00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:41,220
contains all a user configuration

00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:44,990
that is supported by flooding me out of

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:48,770
the box and hostname network

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:51,470
configuration kids that within seconds a

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:56,090
JSON file in a nice formatted

00:22:51,470 --> 00:23:00,110
xml and the other part is all the custom

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:03,380
user data so here we put our own

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:05,820
configuration for clogging it and we are

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,870
setting files in this

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:12,950
in this part and in the future also

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,950
custom scripts and stuff like that

00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:19,940
so and

00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:24,150
in cloudy we just needed to use the

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,760
config drive data source we just to help

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:30,170
make sure that and we are sending the

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:34,770
right volume I need to configure dashtam

00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:38,250
and we didn't have to do much more in

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:40,150
plugging it we contributed only few

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:44,260
pitches

00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:47,080
some fixes and to walk right with the

00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:51,570
wrangler and if i remember correctly it

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:55,660
was some system d related issues and

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:58,270
looking for the quantity right devising

00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:02,740
SL 0 minus a 1 because this is how it

00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:04,690
works and it'll even the same what we

00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:08,910
have to do and really sense the host

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:11,980
agent all we have to do is to extend a

00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:13,990
the vm pale and that i talked about

00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,340
before so we have to support multiple

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,590
files first because we want

00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:23,120
all the user send more files into the

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:29,630
p.m. and also and we have to support a

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:31,130
rename the drive to be confident in the

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,370
engine we have to do a little more work

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:38,000
so first is the same stanchions today we

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:42,200
unveil a future but in addition we have

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,539
to first create and the UI produce and

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,299
so the user could actually fill in all

00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:49,460
the information and also and we have

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:52,669
rest api for passing this information

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:55,940
and the most important stuff is the

00:24:52,669 --> 00:25:00,200
actual loggin actually I've got it for

00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:04,360
building all this on this nice screen

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,360
into the direction what it way

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:15,570
so what are we missing and

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,970
first we would like to have all the club

00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:24,770
unique user data persisted into our

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:24,770
database and this is today missing

00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:30,670
sorry we need for better automation what

00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,860
does it mean it means that we will save

00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:36,710
the user data a with the template and

00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:40,130
basically allow when you create we have

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:43,130
spawned this template a very automation

00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,530
because if for example you set the ssh

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:51,140
keys and you said the hostname to be the

00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:53,720
gym name it will be down to money and I

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,550
don't think that we are missing is not

00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,650
everything that is supported today

00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:03,020
including it is supported in over and

00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:05,270
the most important thing is the custom

00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:11,270
user scripts basically allowing the user

00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:13,680
to write whatever you want to to run

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:18,120
when the vm boots so we got

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:20,850
a nice feature that we thought about it

00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,000
hey we could use cleaning to do that was

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:27,150
actually along the user to check if he

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,530
likes and the overcast agent installs we

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:36,870
could use clogging to install it as a as

00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:41,670
a custom user agent and one thing that

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:46,410
is a long shot in case the clogging it

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:48,570
would and be supported in a right way on

00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,270
windows we might be able to replace

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:54,659
windows display or maybe enhance Windows

00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:57,539
display with blogging

00:26:54,659 --> 00:27:01,549
so I'm not sure about this one

00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:01,549
thinking what may be

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:09,160
and another thing you should remember at

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,570
the beginning I told you that over it is

00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,180
a blood sample data center of

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:16,300
organization but actually you could use

00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:20,770
over also as exactly as a cloud

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:23,560
infrastructure and we have on our world

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:29,549
map some features like instance type

00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:33,629
that will allow better a cloud floats

00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:37,710
second our templates and flavors and

00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:43,980
clogging it could be a fitting to make

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:48,710
this flows even better so questions I

00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,710
have how much time we have

00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:56,480
questions

00:27:52,610 --> 00:28:04,580
okay so and I have quick demo if you

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:06,890
like so basically what basically what

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:12,460
i'm going to show you is creating a vm

00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:18,970
from template that i already made and

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:18,970
setting and some a lovely information

00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,620
in front and in support so what I'm

00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,370
doing here excuse me is a record I

00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:33,259
wanted to do a live demo but my silver

00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:33,259
and it doesn't go

00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:44,450
and what window here first i'm going to

00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:47,070
create the cluster and 75 pretty funny

00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,799
fedora

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:52,309
that

00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,309
before

00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:59,350
and now what I'm doing is in selecting

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:03,220
the optimization we have two types of

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:07,889
optimization a14 server marco desktop

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,889
and though in some small

00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:17,740
those are small differences and the main

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:23,230
thing is that desktop does a thin

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:25,930
provisioning and several does a clone so

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:28,980
this copies of course one faster now all

00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:36,200
I have to do is just type in something

00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:38,529
no hands and then go let's

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,529
problems

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,570
and it takes very quick as you can see

00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:54,250
because this is desktop is provisional

00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:58,240
and no much work to be done and what I'm

00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:02,290
gonna do now is stop the vm so I'm going

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,500
to the initial run any top and I would

00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:08,890
think that I don't want clock me i SAT

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:12,890
here on the hostname and to beat the

00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:16,130
default is the DNA for simply

00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:21,140
what gives it once and I'm going to

00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:22,670
attach try today yeah this is the part

00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,850
that you couldn't see in the stranger

00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,850
before

00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,460
sometime

00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:39,389
that's great this is no this is not a

00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:42,229
custom shoe this is part of

00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:42,229
all coming

00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,140
so clicking okay actually starts the vm

00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,320
in the process that i show you before

00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:58,160
creating the config drive sending little

00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,470
BDSM human forces started and

00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:04,630
this is the first time that they r mb

00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:10,170
CBM and I would connect to

00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:10,170
using SPICE first client opens

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,720
and though I stalking

00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:22,980
see this is

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,980
the first good on your wedding stuff

00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,130
fedora No

00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:09,780
and now on Saturday I'm just checking

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:12,240
the those two configurations really

00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:15,210
actually happen so if you remember I

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,809
said the hostname and put some fire on

00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,809
your damn

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,390
what if we sit there

00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,140
