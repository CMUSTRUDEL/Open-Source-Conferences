Networking in a typical KVM-based system involves a virtual virtio device connected - through a vhost backend - to the host networking stack. The performance and capabilities of each of these components therefore define what networking within the VM can do. In this presentation, Michael S. Tsirkin will review recent developments around virtio and kvm networking, discuss challenges faced, and look forward to how we may address these challenges.
