hi everyone nice to meet you it's a

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,800
great conference so far a lot of over

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,870
attraction in here at five or six

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,839
sessions in cloud open over the

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,210
yesterday ax + 2 r's integration lab for

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,720
the different integration pieces we've

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,330
not did then forward intro to you in

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,670
cloud open its room I can tell you I

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,099
people there did a question of who knows

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,140
what it is over well almost all hands

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,230
were raised as a dramatic changeable

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,079
where we were last year I'm going to

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,520
cover him where we are on community side

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,170
don't the events we have this year some

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,230
of the updates happening throughout the

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,270
year Beatrice the inversions that came

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,850
along and it looking to the future with

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,870
your thoughts do more technical side

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,690
features Dave nearly has a session later

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,270
today on the community aspect of where

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,859
we want to grow the community later on

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,359
this year I'll cover more than technical

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:07,049
side of em so our users mailing list we

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,350
have about 200 Red Hatters on it mainly

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:14,189
stand debt numbers being fiscally static

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,900
since we started the project but as you

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,270
can see the number of unique addresses

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,470
send at least growing all the time a

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,680
very good we have about 800 or 900 user

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,340
800 users currently subscribers sending

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,229
driven over time about 900 users using

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,350
it so if you reduce a red one is a

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:38,250
douche grow for users asking questions

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,049
using or several similar you can see

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,290
that number of commits pronouncing a

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:47,070
project and took a huge at a huge broken

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,470
which number 500 1000 commits per month

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,149
in the various git repositories we

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,590
started with a few gifts and you will

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,799
get our gear if like now right there a

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,750
lot of products going on there this is

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,619
unique contributors per month also

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,770
pretty consistent around the 70 75 each

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,680
month different people we would you go

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,760
obviously for months the same people for

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,200
most of them but again clear grove of

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,860
the number off

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,430
working on the project booking in the

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,590
releases so we're booked over 2014 it's

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,640
a bit hard to remember our first version

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,319
was just last year all right februari

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,540
2012 is when we released a word free

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,090
auto november two thousand eleven was

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,470
the first overt or shopping when we

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:41,880
launch this project back at Cisco in

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,790
sunnyvale but since then right I mean be

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,340
good if there's a clear growth in

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:50,069
community adoption features in the

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,880
versions no the feature coverage and

00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:55,440
parity that we have with other

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,769
virtualization management providers /

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,620
data center and also with the robustness

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,420
of the version over time I'm so free

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,690
other was the first version it had some

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,819
issues one of my favorite emails that

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,610
was a recent email by someone sending an

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,730
email i'm using board 30 and four door

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,519
16 and I'm want and I want to upgrade it

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,340
to free dot free like really who

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,019
remembers that one right so long ago so

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,600
but this running in and is happy with it

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,280
so that version while we considered

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,590
compared to what we have not right with

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,410
hundreds of thousands of bug fixes then

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,290
and hundreds of features since then it

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,780
was still a very good version probably

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,840
good putter King stood we had back at a

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,790
time so looking at this year februari

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,220
looks like ancient history right now we

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,010
will be screwed up so I know the user

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,590
adoption is going behind us what for us

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,780
and we're last phases of women were

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,000
fixing Freda free and looking at three

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,720
to four right now so but very least we

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,819
got free after sorry free to in April

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,829
will least three two one three two one

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,410
had an one important change with other

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:08,670
than bug fixes was the first version

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:11,130
released an l6 send us grell version of

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:15,150
overt until then there was a famous drea

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:18,150
repo that was maintained with back porch

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,380
and fixes 4006 sport but since three two

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:24,419
one reform we support fedora fedora and

00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,460
centos well this ropes and we're working

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,800
hard

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,650
adding under support there's gender work

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,560
that's going on and the engine can

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,900
actually work on gender today we're

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,219
assuming that mundo will have a gender

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,719
is the path to the only one so that

00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:47,080
that's one of the things I hope will

00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:49,419
close again to increase the adoption but

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,849
there's also a lodge Debian community

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:54,639
which is closer to pupunta forum you

00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:56,169
know but still they're different for

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,539
talking about mostly about the

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:02,080
infrastructure guests can run of course

00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:05,080
we heard about Souza the other day and

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:10,599
debian and ubuntu claim on today as

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:12,759
guests September just last month right

00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:15,009
released over three dot for you so much

00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,479
so many things going on released or it

00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:19,120
freed are free now or between the two

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,419
heading porting features in that old

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,439
field of he was a huge version we're

00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:28,000
listing over 331 with closing some of

00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,650
those featured it and if you look at it

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,150
over to least notes for free free one

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,879
which is in beta because it's such a

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,800
large fixed version that we're giving it

00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:39,490
a data and a testing cycle of its own

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,770
and it has literally 100 of bug fixes in

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,449
this version because freed up free was a

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,909
very large version i'll go into more

00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:48,430
details about this you know what's in

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:50,379
two versions in a second but this is one

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,779
of the reason for free da for we're

00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:55,330
looking at shortening the cycle of and

00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:58,000
changing it a bit my dream has continues

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,879
the delivery of monthly versions ago

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,129
will get there we talked about

00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,879
shortening the development cycle to both

00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:08,979
deliver features earlier and more more

00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,379
stable more robust so it's not only

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:13,479
shorter but we're also changing the

00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:15,490
amount of time in the version life cycle

00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:18,580
between development and civilization so

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:21,069
be forking earlier to the stable branch

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:25,449
that the overt accreta to stable branch

00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:27,400
had dozens of patches over 30 free

00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,379
stable branch has hundreds of patches

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,319
and that's not something you really like

00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:34,719
so we're going to check change out and

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,000
probably true that for free at four and

00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:38,180
versions money for so we'll have smaller

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,949
versions with small

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,630
hopefully faster and more stable looking

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,479
at events this has been a very busy year

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:50,090
for this is the first five months of the

00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,669
year right where the events the green

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:56,300
ones if you can see them are the events

00:06:52,669 --> 00:07:00,199
where community users members went and

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:03,080
presented over and not in the idea of an

00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,330
overt workshop orchestrated with by if I

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:10,370
read over our partners we have nada

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:14,419
hosting us in january and indle hosting

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:17,900
us in march in beijing in chicago saw in

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:20,930
shanghai these were two workshop that

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:24,979
were planted last year and one of the

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,949
changes we decided on in the neta board

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,990
meeting in the board meeting in the net

00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:32,210
up or shut up is that we want to use our

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,280
number of workshops we have going

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,220
forward we still kept pushing high which

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,580
was planned and Kevin and plan for this

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,490
one alongside kayvyun for but other than

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,440
that now we wanted to put much more

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,380
emphasis on being in the events like

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,380
this and you know events where users IP

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:57,050
users which are our natural audience for

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:59,960
some fun over you know go do so over the

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,240
events this year around more users

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,180
it's across so linux conectado when was

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,419
kind of women do all of them i think and

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,250
we're planning again table maybe talk

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,780
about this a bit morning in the

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,860
afternoon we're trying to go two more of

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:18,229
those so pause them now we have a huge

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:23,300
present in his column australia back in

00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:24,680
january there was for stockholm and you

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,259
know construct summit the two sessions

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,560
and over it or one was by IBM and one

00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:32,890
was by HP on how to integrate actually

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,870
the issue one knows how to use it over

00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,339
how could open stack views over while

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,399
we're usually done on how over to

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:42,079
leverage OpenStack technologies we had

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,390
someone in cloud open Japan doing over

00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:47,480
infra and SLA and hope it pronounced

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,950
ugly unix often hear nothing another all

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,810
waiting for a lot of forward enjoy the

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,960
different ones you know we

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:56,680
move it right at summit a lot of bluefin

00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:03,590
presence in bizzle I think they call it

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:05,900
I can't renounce the India one we went

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:09,560
to one in Israel to plot open North

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:13,490
America there was a using it up in

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,810
Minnesota k log and obviously this one

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,510
is a big one and I already found out

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,850
that the thing is simple form over those

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,480
was ending in another one no in germany

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:26,029
next this month as well so i look for

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,120
the future but again been busy we've

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:31,460
been traveling but what one other thing

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,350
i hope to see you know from next year is

00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,360
more community members going to local

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,070
conference and talking about their

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,750
implementation looking at the Keely

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:43,100
presentation yesterday it was a great

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:45,050
presentation for two reasons one its for

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,790
us on wii u make if you've been there

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,460
you notice that we were very interested

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,220
in asking person how they use things and

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,410
but also because it's how this can be

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,810
used and what problem it's solving and i

00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:00,170
think going with that type of

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:03,560
presentation by or users community users

00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:09,230
to presentations in their area will help

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:11,060
the outreach off the orbit project back

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,960
in april i started sending emails with

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,820
forward updates reason i did isn't that

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,080
i found out to my surprise that i don't

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,660
know everything that's going on in your

00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,180
world and i have to and find out about

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,880
stuff so i started exciting i don't know

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,160
what's going on right probably others

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,120
are not familiar with all the activity

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,280
going on now i just put highlights here

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,010
of things that have no this moment look

00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:41,120
you know migrants support and ansible

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:45,230
support the known boxes people did a see

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,650
an api sdk library for over the covert

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,860
one we had at the moon to ensues a guest

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,270
OSS to over the night your arm for Boone

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,240
Debby and the guest agents themselves

00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:59,480
and again a lot of other artists not

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,410
going to cover all of them we had an

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,100
intriguer to DUI plugins one of the nice

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,990
one with

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,120
show writing conferences is a crash

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,680
course on how to develop a UI plugin

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,230
because it's so easy to develop them

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,480
it's just JavaScript that you can deploy

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,190
on top and over engine over engine and

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,860
to make this appealing porch that who

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,630
develop that there's a nice guy plugin

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,279
which is about protecting your data

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,509
center from alien invasion right it

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,069
shows how you add something to

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:29,959
right-click all right when you're

00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:34,490
standing on the data center and then you

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:36,889
get this nice html5 game and it's my DC

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,329
is under attack right and afterwards

00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:41,000
chose to score and things like that so

00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:43,250
it's a very nice crash course it you

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,639
know it has all the JavaScript in it to

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,440
do that I just know wiki page on the on

00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,709
the website everything I showing here is

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,800
from everything is from presentation

00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:58,190
wiki pages on the website which I coffee

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,709
one of those you I plugins which very

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,440
valuable is for the monitoring plugin so

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:05,839
monitoring plugins are not yet plugins

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,149
there's an adios plugging that monitors

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,759
over it and if you will go to know yes

00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:14,360
you see some statistic on the house and

00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:16,610
on the engine from the nagios you I but

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,240
if you're inside the over the engine you

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:23,060
may want to see those nagios statistics

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,519
off on your host and this UI plugin

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,500
allows you to stand on a host and see

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,290
them both nagios is collecting from our

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,819
attention and the graphs inside the

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,639
house there are a lot of other do i plug

00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:36,199
into the net on soon and there are

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,399
others that are being worked by

00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:43,040
different partners that's going to be

00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:44,899
published soon as well so after the

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,170
fizzle conference there wasn't we have a

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:51,199
user maleness in portuguese now it's on

00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:53,779
traffic there one of the issues we had

00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:56,300
her spice was that was only by

00:12:53,779 --> 00:13:00,709
personally next and activates which is

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,959
hard to get on windows and this was

00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:05,089
greatly improved by the great group on

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,430
the one hand and by the spice group on

00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,949
the other hand so there is a spice for

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,220
mac now I think the ones for Android as

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:15,410
well and despite 60 I finally supports

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,970
windows as well but also the Mayan type

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,180
based launch which allows you to

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:24,680
spice without rappers to it so that's a

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,779
great improvement we feel freedom for

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,910
the freedom free version we also did a

00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,800
lot of deep dives on the large features

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,660
there so there are deep dive session

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,160
into a pre-release know there are links

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,139
to those sessions those sessions were

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,939
sent to use a mailing list of what you

00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:41,180
speak live in them and the role is

00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:43,490
recorded on stall them we recorded so

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,920
for large creatures and feed our free

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,889
there's a one-hour session usually going

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,100
into details on how that feature was

00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:54,350
designed with how to use it which i

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,850
think is a wealth of information for

00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:00,980
learning on dancing that version this is

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,769
the NAP you i plug in some of it at

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,300
least when this we trust I have a this

00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:08,029
allows for better integration with

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,180
another storage array to do things like

00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:13,459
fast provisioning can clone the vm will

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,230
do it in you know a few seconds set of

00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:18,529
beating all the information because it's

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:22,129
asking the storage to clone the image

00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:25,279
and register it in the over engine so

00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:27,139
you add in a storage area here and then

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,019
you can just take actions on it and

00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:33,439
manage that's working with a bit more

00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:38,000
features for netapp storage kimchi got

00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:42,290
incubated which and uncovered yesterday

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,449
can choose for less of a data center

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,939
distribution more managing that host by

00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:51,800
host support single host play and the or

00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:56,089
word node added a plumbing for it so we

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,550
can have an overt node with kimchi build

00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:00,470
out of the box which i don't remember

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,600
was released but since kimchi is an

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,290
active development at some point they

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,360
need to release that together um i

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:13,399
mentioned the ubuntu and debian gas

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,290
station that we have and I despise 6pr

00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,910
for windows which is interesting wonder

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,459
and there's a consider a lot of updates

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,319
are not going over all of them I was

00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:23,569
thinking look at that presentation later

00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:27,139
on for all that all with my monthly

00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:29,209
updates um University of Kansas

00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:31,120
pronounce its full name that is as well

00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:33,790
you dance University

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,339
they created their own self service

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,260
portal they called the order portal they

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:39,940
shared the code on the users mailing

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:43,570
list so it's a different user interface

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:46,720
for ordering the ends off different type

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:49,480
that they have for users using the coda

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,270
mechanism and the rest api and pike and

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,610
sdk but with the user interface built

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:59,620
for their use we actually created sample

00:15:54,610 --> 00:16:00,940
user portal in java Ruby and Python for

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,120
anyone that wants to develop something

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:07,990
like that for the basic use case off and

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,540
started the etc heater more has more

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,940
functionality also creates VMs things

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:17,500
like that but that code is also sure

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:19,660
anyone wants to use that one of the nice

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,760
things that we saw in the past few

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,580
months so there was work by IBN do it

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,440
powerpc support to BDSM but it wasn't

00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,970
integrated into the overt engine and

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,770
there's a presentation later on today

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,560
but another from the other illicit

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:38,770
center about their powerpc war to add

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,890
multiple architectures to be over engine

00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,750
so I'm guessing that this should get

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,820
merged into free divorce or if we that

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:49,830
for should hopefully have support for

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:52,660
managing our PC hosts as virtualization

00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,640
hypervisors the engine I expect we'll

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,010
see we XA is safe but it's one engine

00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,200
and our blog post so it's a good start

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,900
and one of the thing now and I'm

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,550
surprised to see a couple weeks ago

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,939
suddenly found out that there's a puppet

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:09,699
and shift confident chef scripts recipes

00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:14,319
to deploy forward engine and overt node

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:17,589
by a private chat which okay one other

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:21,280
came and now do in the community and

00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:24,250
leverage and intestine but nice zero dot

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:28,600
one version testin contribute to that

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:30,880
github repo that's on you know various

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,740
updates and things that happen let's

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,480
look at some of the future so if we not

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,780
do as I mentioned boo remembers right as

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,060
well back in February the eel six of

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,340
what was that was first introduced there

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,510
which has somewhat of a better life

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,130
cycle for updates then

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:50,530
which isn't leader working after six

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:53,660
months then he'll sit sit a bit more but

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,520
stable you got 21 erupted it does have

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,550
the drawback off some of the features

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,710
are not there until they arrive while we

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:03,380
can you can use them with fedora we're

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,760
seeing this with the negative cluster f

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,130
s George domain which is available in

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,270
khadora but still not available in which

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:15,500
centers on pl6 we're hoping to solve

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:17,210
that creating some specific rpms or

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,610
something like that or the missing

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,850
features for yellow 6 but it's extra

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:26,770
what we have to do but again so each one

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:29,000
has its pros and cons other you know

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,860
right now they look like obvious one

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,350
would do a lot of for him time to get to

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,770
them like live snapshot flash storage

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:39,620
migration this plug Nick the UI

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:44,300
plug-in which allowed to grow the

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:46,040
ecosystem of products and project

00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,380
integrating with the old project so

00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:53,480
billion-fold inversion is more to

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:56,540
closing future gaps we got free that is

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,220
a huge version and there are so many

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,150
features on that two pages of the

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,920
highlights of features in feed are free

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,170
from the live snapshot with memory and

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,180
we show this we saw and we started

00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,760
leveraging mom for cpu shears and

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,980
ballooning and finally i have open LF

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,900
indication still only with karros

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,300
working on that for free the 42 not

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,210
required Kerberos but still have that

00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,760
although entities in a bit more details

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:26,240
the OpenStack a neutron network provider

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,730
so we're trying to be much more friendly

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,560
to integrating with other things so you

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,690
can see that when we started with back

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,590
with the video sent books which allow

00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:39,430
you to control some flows at the host

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:42,440
level then we added the rest api and

00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,840
python and java sdk and there's a ruby

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:50,030
sdk and yourself a c1 and i found out

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:53,510
that there's a closure sdk as well but i

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:55,040
do go look you know what it's about so

00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,240
we're trying to add more and more in

00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,240
feel free we have

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,750
openstack neutron integration which

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,670
allows an ability to add to use networks

00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:07,100
food network providers not only Neutron

00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:11,150
you can create other ones as well you

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:14,120
can use the OpenStack glance project you

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:16,220
can use for meant for host provisioning

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,920
you can use the pluggable scheduler to

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,480
write your own custom scheduling

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,550
policies and control the scheduling

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,460
policies that you have which the one

00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:29,630
will cover so oven something else this

00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:33,770
was healthy yeah so a lot of focus on

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:35,810
integration so the OpenStack Neutron

00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,730
provider in the network providers in

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:41,600
general allow us to leverage both the

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,690
ecosystem of companies worgen and

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,500
partners working to implement Neutron

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,300
providers so out of the box deals that

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,480
will you use open this switch and not

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:56,600
just Linux bridge no point as an

00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:01,940
implementation mechanism and it allows

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,890
to use either there directly by writing

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,160
a different network provider or through

00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,360
the neutron implementation things like

00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:12,020
mellanox networking the serial

00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:14,840
networking cisco ucs things like that

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,940
that the gap to implement them now

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,830
doesn't quite changes to the engine

00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,030
better implementing a network provider

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:25,210
or just a small fish driver free BDSM

00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,950
using the existing network

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,450
implementations in your pond that's part

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,830
of the thing if allowed to do and the

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,990
other thing it all has to do is to

00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,090
leverage more easily new features

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,430
introduced in your online security group

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,200
I Pam IP allocation management things

00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,030
like that that we're still on accusing

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,320
today but we're going to see going

00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:47,960
forward another thing is we had feline

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,790
management so far and now you can we can

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,260
look at govt tunneling and the explain

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:55,340
things like that through the neutron

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:57,080
integration so you just go ad a neutron

00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,240
provider you have been stolen on it

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,490
doesn't insult out a box for you and

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,260
then you can import Neutron networks

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,180
will create your own networks and you

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:09,679
know to the definition for that and if

00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:11,630
leslie won it also deploys the neutron

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,870
taejun on the hosts

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,790
figurative things like that the glens

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,700
image providers of lenses and image

00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:22,730
repository images are read-only discs or

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,800
like our templates in overt mainly you

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:28,370
can use this as an import and export to

00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:31,700
name it has the drawback of it doesn't

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,800
support snapshot change like we support

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,500
in our expert domains but on the other

00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,210
hand you can connect it to multiple data

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,550
centers and multiple over it soon

00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,360
taneously so it's much easier to export

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:46,610
and import between environments using

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,790
glass so again you just add it and then

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:53,060
you have this new storage domain type of

00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:56,450
glance and you can import you can import

00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:59,570
from it interesting the foreman is a

00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:02,720
project that is that allows lifecycle

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:06,440
management of host or virtual machines

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,620
basically of new of physical or virtual

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,480
machines we want to integrate more with

00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,490
it right now the integration is about

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,820
post provisioning so if you add a phone

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,680
provider you can search house from form

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,170
informant has barely starting things

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,920
like that and heavily uses puppet and

00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:26,750
smart parties to manage the machine in

00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:30,220
the environment registering it to be in

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:35,660
the mtns configuring networking for it

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:37,250
things like that so with adding the

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,710
phone integration you can manage your

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,280
physical health reform in and add them

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:45,080
to over engine I see this you know

00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,870
extending a bit to both allow some more

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,820
forms vm lifecycle and a bit more of a

00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:55,820
burial discovery and implementation for

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:58,880
overt for hosts so this is the pluggable

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,740
scheduler you can now control the

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,480
policies the policies used to be kind of

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,090
embedded in the code for how do we

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,220
schedule choose which host is better or

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,560
which house can be used which is weights

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,760
and filters and this was a model in a

00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:15,410
way is very clear on what each part in

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,430
the scheduling does and you can now

00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:22,250
decide to say i don't want you know this

00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:25,460
filtering and i don't want this waiting

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:28,039
model or just want to affect the waiting

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,929
of some things in the scheduling the

00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:32,630
other nice part about this is invite

00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:36,049
your own Titan based filter ways and

00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,600
scheduling policies and there's a and

00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:42,140
the over engine talks to this scheduling

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,299
proxy in Python and very simply you can

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,309
control the scheduling and improve it to

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:48,770
your needs tailored to your needs even

00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:51,049
for things not covered by the engine

00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,059
today which is similar to how VD sm

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:55,460
copes allowed you to do change at VD sm

00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:57,980
level before they were implemented in

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,630
the engine there are samples already for

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,360
samples for different scheduling

00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:05,090
policies and again some of them more

00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,559
useful scheduling policies will probably

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,020
be implemented in the engine going

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,340
forward but now you don't have to block

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,590
on it's a missing feature you can do

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:17,870
that yourself very simply with samples

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:20,360
and obviously help now listen the

00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,130
watchdog allows you to configure VMware

00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,990
the watchdog watch it means that it

00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,789
monitor p.m. is monitoring the guess if

00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,490
the guest doesn't function it has water

00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:31,610
prior inside it can you will recycle the

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,980
guesses that another type of h8 from

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:37,669
channel you can get to bit more rent /

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:39,770
than the forward HOA functionality which

00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:41,450
is still needed it general crash or the

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:45,730
house crash but it gives you a bit more

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:54,230
functionality with virtual wash off in

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:56,809
free free one not missing patches would

00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:00,230
be much more set of patch is missing in

00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:03,169
free free to close implementation of the

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:07,159
Vinick profile so now you can define or

00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:10,760
a Vinick profile and for those profiles

00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,620
you can define the limiting quality of

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,549
service off the network so how much

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:19,159
traffic this minute and now can use how

00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:22,039
much bandwidth etc so you can do some

00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:25,549
more quality of service so that adds to

00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:28,190
the ballooning and cpu sharing so we now

00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:34,120
have cpu memory and network quality of

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:36,980
service introductory cloud in it is a

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,480
kind of a guest agent that runs on the

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,230
first boot there are different ways to

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,850
do image

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,669
provision English there's the fix-it

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:46,520
kickstart approach there's a full image

00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:48,290
approach and cloud ends is more towards

00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,090
the image approach but I need to pick

00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:52,910
some things in it it's kind of like the

00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:55,070
windows sysprep that we use Windows but

00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,380
and we didn't have that for linux

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,910
clouding it is all in all linux

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,730
distributions of those are working for

00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:03,860
tinted windows is being used by both

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,690
amazon cloud and OpenStack you configure

00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,620
PS button and launch them for things

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:13,580
like what's the who can what's the

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:16,309
public SSH key for that guess so this

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:19,130
way if you pass that as the best

00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:23,470
launches you can ssh into it and you

00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:27,770
control who can use this guest when you

00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:29,960
launch that instance it's not all you

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:32,299
know everyone that knows the root user

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,760
password of my template to have much

00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:37,070
better granularity on how you use those

00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,960
guests and it's for things like IP

00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,700
address management times though and

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,530
again I think that the ssh one is that

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,049
the clear use case where you need this

00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,049
because dhcp you could use no i was

00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:52,100
named there were other ways to solve

00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:53,720
injecting the ssh key for root 2 against

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,370
is something that's very dear

00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,880
demonstration of how this feature is

00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:01,010
useful and actually allows you to run

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,020
any script that you want as well as part

00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:05,120
of the bootstrapping ejected there's a

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,010
lot recommendation around buffets are

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,120
there a lot of functionality Roncalli

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,520
and everyone say there's a lot of

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,000
documentation around it definitions rica

00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:16,360
cote obviously but but it is improving

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,520
and it is being used in the leverage

00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,190
both OpenStack and easy to use so it's

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,160
basically that's the way you provision

00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:28,669
guess this day pull linux and with work

00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:31,160
for this and some more features in freed

00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:33,530
up free right i want to exhaust released

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,179
one unless the station serves the words

00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:37,700
session yesterday about that so i'm

00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:41,840
going to detail job is the gave the novi

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:44,059
and see as well comes by a lot of folks

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,690
in the spice html5 one as well i guess

00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:50,080
which still has a few boxes windows it's

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,080
upside down

00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:58,070
it's a one liner right it says ancient

00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,770
India the host of the engine is still

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:04,460
coming some of it is in Italy but not

00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:07,150
enough to use it so I hope it's not in

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,410
51 I hope we can close that gap in 332

00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:12,020
for the other engine host of the engine

00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:15,440
is the ability to run the engine itself

00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,880
as a vm on the host it manages the one

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,179
we'll cover that in the next session in

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:27,289
much more detail again lots of features

00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:29,690
wouldn't go into them I looking at you

00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:31,669
know we just coming next every version i

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,559
do this fall to the community users

00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:37,280
community and what you want to see next

00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:39,230
and and we try to match some of those

00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:43,429
things like people interested in

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:45,799
implementing this sum of aligns with

00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:48,080
things that now we want to do if i do

00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:50,870
things that are already very close what

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,309
we have to do in the works and things

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:54,200
which are high on the radar that want to

00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:57,260
do it's not covering all the items

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,270
anything like that i mean we got to it a

00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:03,080
hundred items in it and photography and

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:04,669
more so very very high level so does

00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,559
what going on to refactor the

00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:09,020
vindication mechanism that we have that

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,110
is to allow easier integration of

00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:15,429
providers for things like LF without

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:18,770
care bras or or kerberos authentication

00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:20,419
to the API and user portal or not just

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,390
using hair loss after that if you like

00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:25,970
that the policy supported I mentioned

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:28,460
the rest api is currently only with xml

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,200
is going to use json as well which we're

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,720
looking for because we want to move the

00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,270
web and user portal to work on top the

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,190
rest api today view some old

00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,380
implementation that we want to clean out

00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:43,580
so doing that adjacent will do better

00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:46,490
than doing that with XML I shown me for

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,900
the quality of service plan / clinic but

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,929
there isn't the quality of service /

00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:55,460
logical network so you can control the

00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:57,679
migration network or how much of you how

00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,200
much bandwidth you can take so that's

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,900
when you closed here the future level

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,190
negotiation is something that we want to

00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,990
to do because frankly

00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,850
we used to work with cluster levels and

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:11,450
while I think it's very useful have

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:13,399
cluster levels we saw that the native

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,429
Gloucester implementation was in fedora

00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:18,320
but not on l6v dsm-iii-r free can do

00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:20,720
that but there's no q neoliberal support

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,730
on that machine I expect similar things

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,519
to happen with the par pc or the moon

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:27,049
distribution or yell 7 when it's coming

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,850
along it will have different features

00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:31,879
which will want to have in the same

00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:34,549
cluster level but we'll have to have VD

00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:36,769
sm to report to us by dou y plus or

00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:39,500
black lace about something's so the

00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:43,100
engine a lot try to use them incorrectly

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,409
a fedora 20 is coming along we do

00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,929
support that and want to get around

00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:49,580
ubuntu support host profile is mostly

00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:52,789
around networking if you need to

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,379
configure dozens of hosts which you know

00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:56,870
are the same networking wise you don't

00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:59,000
want to do it one by one defining the

00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:03,769
logical network so both profiles will

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,679
live to do this in a single one time the

00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:09,200
vm affinity built to run let's say

00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:11,480
clustered guess so you don't want to run

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,210
on the same host or it's a web and a BB

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,799
you want them too long the same nose

00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,149
this was always high on the list but we

00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:19,009
always said after will do the pluggable

00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:22,970
schedule now we did apart schedule so

00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:26,360
right same goes to hotpot cpu which is

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:38,870
you know just working for all education

00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:41,649
is there actually Keystone is integrated

00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:45,080
today because the way we use Neutron and

00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:47,029
Lance today is you have to give us the

00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,409
keys you don't have to you can use them

00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:50,659
anonymously if they can figure from

00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:52,519
nanas on occasion or you need to give us

00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:55,190
the Keystone potential but that's used

00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:57,139
today only for using Lance or neutron

00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:01,309
for configuring the credentials for the

00:32:57,139 --> 00:33:06,049
provider so we have the OpenStack gel

00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:08,690
SDK which fidelio send a few catchers to

00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:10,940
improve to local what we need so that we

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,200
using the OpenStack java sdk do not part

00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,399
of the OpenStack what is useful for

00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,840
anyone using Java with OpenStack so we

00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,720
improved it a bit of help improving

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,210
as well Alex III also now that it's

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,130
working human you okay against something

00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:29,470
that you always said will be once it's

00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:33,049
there it's there so close that yeah a

00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:34,970
host object manager so this is I on the

00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:37,309
radar a chance not something which is

00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,470
simple to close and that depends if you

00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:41,150
you know we can get it into the version

00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,370
as I mentioned one to do small versions

00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,710
so hopefully some of those will get into

00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:48,260
this one or the next one so if I going

00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:50,360
forward so ho something manager is about

00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,470
the ability to choose a closed set of

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,600
hosting the cluster and ask to update

00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,679
them and move a host of maintenance do

00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,350
that you know one by one like that

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,210
Foreman actually has the mechanism to do

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:08,179
this so we're not sure if you want to do

00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,490
this implantation performing or naked

00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:12,109
leading over because maybe who phone

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:14,379
will be much easier to do this we'll see

00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:17,000
then Blake versions that build you

00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:18,649
create multiple versions of template and

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,940
say that this is not just you know I

00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:24,830
have a bit rustic Ford or 19 fedora 19

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,379
am update after a month fedora 19

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:29,839
updated after another month etc rather

00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:32,089
say this is latest fedora 19 image I

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,550
want to use and for example with a

00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:35,990
stateless pool you could just say this

00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,540
will uses the stateless stamp like

00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,070
version version of that template and

00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,879
every time you launch something you from

00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:46,429
that pool if you use the latest image

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,109
private networks ability to run virtual

00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:49,820
machines connected to each other without

00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:52,099
being connected to the physical

00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:55,040
interface apparently there's an end for

00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:59,060
that use case came out in the community

00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,820
Paul as well resizing a storage domain

00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,680
lung so you had a nice cozy lon you

00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,470
extended it because we need more space

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:11,330
but which day doesn't know and handle

00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:13,339
that in that's it basically does not end

00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,720
with inputting a data domain you lost

00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:16,310
your engine you have the date of the

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,530
main you want to reinstall the engine

00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:20,900
want to import it today it's like well

00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:24,109
if it's NFS change to export and import

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,180
it or DB it all that stuff just want to

00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:29,089
support it negatively which goes along

00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,740
with ability to support posts which

00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:33,050
starts in the same data center which is

00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:36,770
conan quest again these are just things

00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:40,490
which are hard to change actually some

00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:42,830
of the changes or both we that one and

00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:45,350
three two and free free are on the path

00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:47,090
to allow this is removing different

00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:49,340
things that prevent us from doing those

00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,200
changes you can take life snatcher but

00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,850
can't currently live in a shop again

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,190
something with the Keystone

00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,990
authentication and sender storage room

00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,410
in which will again allows you extend

00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:02,210
the echo system and features we can use

00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:07,400
around some of the sort management of

00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:13,160
storage features that's very high level

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:14,510
very fast before and you very much if

00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:20,150
there are any questions I'll be happy to

00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:22,480
answer okay get the guy Ron thank you

00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,480
