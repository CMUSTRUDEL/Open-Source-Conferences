QEMU supports many image formats, ranging from native formats such as QCOW2 and QED, to formats from competing software such as VMDK and Hyper-V, and many others. Each image format is implemented by a new block driver, and new image format patches are fairly common submissions to the QEMU developer mailing list. This talk aims to demystify the process of implementing a new image format, and act as a primer on how to create a new block driver. The interfaces required for a driver implementation are covered, as well as more complex concepts needed to create a fully-functional modern block image driver. These concepts include such topics as coroutines and how they relate to block drivers, backing files, and underlying raw files.
