Title: KVM Forum 2013: Empowering Data Center Virtualization Using KVM by Livnat Peer
Publication date: 2014-10-30
Playlist: KVM Forum 2013
Description: 
	Have you ever wondered how KVM is used in a full blown Data Center virtualization solution? oVirt is an open virtualization project which enables the management of multi-host, multi-tenant virtual data centers, including high availability, VM and storage live migration, storage and network management, system scheduler and more. oVirt provides an integration point for several open source virtualization technologies, including kvm, libvirt, spice, oVirt node and numerous OpenStack components such as Neutron and Glance. The session will provide an introduction to the oVirt project and shed light on how a data center administrator's actions in a web UI are translated into KVM commands running on the hypervisors.

for the past five years am a

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,790
neutralization and I would like know a

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,509
few guys I have a low heard about it Oh

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:17,340
build me one you know I did that well

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:21,029
that's good openstack last one in DM

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:26,099
well ok so that's a good proud of you

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:28,109
and I'm here to try and explain what of

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,830
it is a great choice when it comes to

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:36,030
managing your net your network yo your

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,790
wheelchair that is a data centers and i

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,309
would like to start with the short story

00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:44,940
so five years ago there was a start-up

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:47,039
named kuma net and they had some

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,719
brilliant engineers one of them is

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,870
advocating found out okay here and cumin

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,590
i've had for multiple projects but

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,710
mostly they focused on kvm and that the

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:08,400
other project was management why do we

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:13,020
need management for kvm well that's not

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,460
the slide i was hoping to see you again

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,460
it's all major change

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:32,630
too many sessions I guess I have another

00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:36,170
session earlier this morning and this

00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:38,930
was the site I wanted to see so this is

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:42,770
the option of managing kvm manually

00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:46,280
basically it's nice it is for obviously

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:49,280
liberties much much better but then you

00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,340
can use amendment solution is needed

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,740
sakuma net at the time invested time to

00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:00,229
walk on the management solution to be

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,690
able to use KPM it into math and

00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:06,680
manipulates the virtual machines in

00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:10,610
there in a scale here's the friendly

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:18,470
manner then went back to my original

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:20,570
slide deck yep so for me cause i joined

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,459
over i joined put it at five years ago

00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:26,989
and i enjoyed it and because i wanted to

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:30,320
work on an open source a based projects

00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:32,750
working in Jogja and basically what they

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,150
got my first thoughts was you have to

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,549
work on a closed source project with an

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,060
in c-sharp and you have to somehow make

00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:43,640
it a walk here on boss work for Redick

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,150
which means over there Saffold walk on

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,600
linux etc so that was my welcome and

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,580
predict together but essence we came a

00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,920
long way and we have object which is

00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,709
listening well party Java partly

00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:03,230
faithful depends on which component

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:07,160
nvidia in all of it and that so i

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:11,230
started for me a way so i don't do it

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:15,019
about opiate is about managing your

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:19,579
virtualized back center it's still for

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:24,820
kvm hypervisor and it's an open source

00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:29,959
of energy for vmware vsphere and vcenter

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:32,810
please behind organs well we have some

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,959
big companies taking place area

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,060
obviously i'm from there and girls the

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,510
IP I'm an Internet Armenia

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,790
good companies that's got in the path of

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,120
the other government governance that

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:50,750
we're going to discuss later so over to

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,940
us is by default package for fedora and

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,430
there is also a packaging for well and

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,310
send us of course the community is

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:03,140
working on and making it available for

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:05,239
gentle and other flavors then you can go

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,220
to dealt with website and see which is

00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,600
walking on which distribution but mostly

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:15,260
and or the focus was until not long ago

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,000
it was it was definitely go on there

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,859
which is the letter get the price

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,850
neutralization product is based on

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:24,410
backorder testing what are the basic

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,419
requirements that we want to support

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,250
well obviously this is there a basic one

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,590
we have the hose with mass culture which

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,270
is running on it nothing special there's

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,760
a package center is a logical entity

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,200
that is the container for all the

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,220
resources that are required for

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:42,020
executing the virtual machine and more

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,289
interesting deployment is to have

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,780
multiple hypervisors multiple hosts and

00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:51,680
newer machines wanna connect wireless

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:55,370
and its regulation domain / because

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,350
immigration domain is useful a vm skin

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,169
language from one host to another stay

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,700
out of the data center level and the

00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:04,100
more typical deployment would be

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,800
multiple data centers in each one you

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,460
have multiple castells with with a

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:14,810
virtual machines a migrating between

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:18,020
their hosts ok so who is a typical

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:22,389
computer we have three flavors we have

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:25,610
the basic sticking penguin it was stupid

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:28,970
some consumers given and the basic

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,950
consumer of virtual machines so all you

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,620
can do is basically standard stuff is

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,289
virtual machines nothing special then I

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,600
get the poptart get the UI hotel with

00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:41,389
all the future machines it stop stop see

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,680
the technical parameters of the veal

00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:48,320
chop machine a more interesting user is

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,840
the dancing penguin he can actually

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,990
create its own virtual machines

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,150
and you can you can do that based on a

00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,680
quarter allocated for him by the

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,680
administrators that nice play to

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,199
basically allocated CPU memory and

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,199
storage and you can generate a virtual

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,210
machine just based on those on those

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,180
resources and you can also create your

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,110
future machines based on tablets

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,020
definitely something I'm going to

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:28,590
mention a to b cable and then we have

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:32,070
their way back kiss between this nice

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:36,210
little pinwheel and with toe box since

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:38,729
the administrator so he has the this

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,530
whole toolbox you can use he can

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:43,289
configure the storage and configure the

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:46,530
network and can set a filter shields in

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:50,160
a pool of virtual machines the idea is

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,960
that he should be able to all other

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:59,700
finishing on the configuration all these

00:06:51,960 --> 00:07:01,470
companies within 1 UI a possible so when

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,330
you first the management for me there

00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,600
are three aspects you should look into

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:09,450
the first one is definitely simplicity I

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,120
want to make sure that the management

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:15,030
solution amusing is simple to use and

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,669
I'm not wasting my time and configuring

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,680
the management solution I need to think

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,900
about capacity planning and you think

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,460
about the follow G of my of my setup I

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,400
don't want to spend my time just

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,560
deploying and redeploying over and over

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,330
the management solution the management

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,720
solution should be a tool for me to use

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,720
not spend my time on second the

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,789
objective would be stability I would

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,520
definitely want to make sure that that

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:44,580
the management solution amusing is going

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,680
to keep my work load up and running I'm

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,080
not going to lose my database I'm not

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,419
going to lose my disks my dad are my

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,849
precious data what does until is that

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:56,669
that's definitely stability before if

00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:59,400
they were just broke go for and the last

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:02,370
one is functionality and that's I

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,960
believe is a tricky one when you when

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,639
comes to choosing which type of

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,349
management solution you wanted

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,719
you want you need you have to look into

00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:11,249
what are your requirements what's the

00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:13,289
wall clock you're going to run on that

00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:15,300
management solution what kind of

00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:18,599
features you need and only then go and

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,939
look and see if it's available within we

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,370
didna put this specific solution you

00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:26,990
chose so we're going to look into those

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:30,319
aspects but believe it comes to open

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:34,560
okay so now it's like that was a people

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,479
duplicity installation okay so

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,089
definitely is throwing you over these

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,490
quite easy yum install it using fado

00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:43,289
it's already packaged there it's the

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,860
uninstall and then you do an engine sale

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:48,959
um setup is like configuring the lack of

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,820
AC oh well it's possible just basic

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,370
stuff and then you've got weeks at your

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,640
Apple ID so from installation point of

00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:00,180
view it's quite easy and consume what I

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,100
mean is to consume valid a user

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:07,560
interaction mechanism so i would say

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:10,250
that each one has its own flavor way or

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,680
it's no way to communicate Oh to use

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,019
technologies for learning go executing

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,000
things in their management so for me

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,519
it's like if you use Python if you like

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,310
biking than you've gotten over the 500k

00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,380
and you've got to see a life you have if

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:29,100
you like Java then you have the Java SDK

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,440
you definitely have the web services

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,500
that they lucky just use them books in

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,180
them and you have the UI so from that

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,899
perspective you can choose whatever you

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:44,130
feel more comfortable with and that is

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:46,230
they will note so so how did you like

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,410
the bird is this based on the burger is

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,660
this for Arnold yes oh the vm lifecycle

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,490
management is done via live on the whole

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,410
step so this is like you know when you

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,610
do on your client side where you have

00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,100
your management interface it's not

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,589
hunting about the insulation on the

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,660
nodes so actually you don't have to go

00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,579
to the note it said oh you have two days

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,380
walk with it with a management however

00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,810
bug you with you I we're going to see I

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,370
like them with them to probably make

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,310
more sense but technically all the

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,140
things that I executed on the host level

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,120
it's kind of unfair to the user unless

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,440
you want to customize it customize it

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,960
and that you can go to then

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:27,120
then we can see a mechanism called a

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:29,880
customized ago ok so there's over noon

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,440
we have my consider a desk so pretty

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:37,730
much yeah so here's that maintainer than

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,440
the ones working on that o is to open up

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,810
anyway over though it is just enough

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,800
fedora to be able to function as an

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:49,440
hypervisor the meaning of that is that

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,420
Fedora has a lot of packages and that

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,940
means a lot of security potential

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,160
security holes potential of

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,130
administration and lot of conflicts and

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,870
if you have so if you packaging just

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:04,560
enough adolphus but get an image which

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:08,100
is around 170 megas which is quite good

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,050
and you don't get all the North useful

00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,940
other packages that you don't want to

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,800
have on your hyper battle that's one

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,930
thing you get from what with North makes

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,910
it most simple to reading the other

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,160
thing is that when you want to add a

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,920
host to your setup then you can either

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,200
add a host via the UI we are going to

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,980
see that Florida oh you can use their

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,350
self registration a flow which means the

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,940
host is registering itself on the

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,460
management node and all you have to do

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,050
that is to approve that hope for that

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:43,040
you have to use the overflowed which is

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:45,690
their payroll image configuration what

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,900
some aspect of simplicity know what is

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,130
that you have the configuration is it

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,550
you have like a centralized

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,410
configuration in place you can configure

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,240
and change configuration for everything

00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,520
that you want in a single place and that

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,620
would propagate to all of your setup

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:07,830
which is quite easy and i think that's

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:09,390
it the simplicity pouts quick stop's all

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,250
you want so if you want to go and drag

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:14,100
over it all you have to do is eat it

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,589
there's a POC kind of deployment where

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,750
you get the engine they hide your eyes

00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:21,210
on the database and the storage all

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:24,150
located in a single host machine and

00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:25,770
it's still easy to consume you you do

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,170
that i am in store but you looked in

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:31,020
stores are the only one plug in and then

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:33,059
you do the engine setup stuff you

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,009
connect to the UI and there you go

00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:39,479
you've got object so I wanted to show

00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:41,429
you live demo I'm basting my demo on the

00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:46,279
nested field so I really hope it's going

00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:51,059
to behave what but they did do some

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:52,769
three preparations which one of them is

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,209
that they copied an image into the eyes

00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:58,849
of the men's I'll be able to use it

00:12:54,209 --> 00:13:02,879
within need to start of the drum machine

00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:05,579
technically that they did in addition to

00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:09,659
them to stay excited the installation

00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:11,129
and the configuration so I di didn't

00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,539
want to do I didn't want to do the

00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:15,569
installation out because it takes some

00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:17,519
time to download all the packages and I

00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:19,979
didn't thousand added value to that

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,389
sliced keep that car that must seem down

00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:24,629
with the configuration and you login

00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:26,519
into the console all you have to do to

00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:30,179
stop your vm is to just give me a

00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,559
dialogue and here you can see you guys

00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,509
everything filled out very differently

00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,489
you have a class that you have a data

00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:37,999
center already defined falou you also

00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:44,009
have their local storage defined for you

00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:47,429
you need to give it a name you can

00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:49,019
optionally choose a description for this

00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:50,789
specific virtual machine i'm going to

00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:54,179
put it from a CD to make sure it's

00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:56,009
phantom fast enough ok so those two

00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,749
images this is what they did before all

00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,909
the station i copied clean dishes into

00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:04,739
my eyes of the major be able to boot

00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:06,989
from the CD that's it i have at the end

00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:10,079
i can add this can i can add a net over

00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:11,729
but that's not necessary for for this pm

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,809
I just want to make sure you guys see

00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:17,669
the functional and access I start + this

00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:22,769
and start button and if you have

00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:24,539
explained right now so just just before

00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:27,179
we connected to the vm i want you to see

00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:30,269
this does the main tab for all the main

00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:33,719
entities we have the data centers we can

00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:37,169
also see it on the screen on the right

00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:38,429
hand side there are two defendants the

00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:42,389
local data center was created

00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:45,239
specifically for the all-in-one is demo

00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:46,579
I mean automatically when you determine

00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:50,029
what you wanted is a local

00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:52,910
we created for you we have the customer

00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:54,769
with a local a step because he hosts

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,679
which is that that the local hooks them

00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,540
hanging on and here you can see the

00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,579
virtual machine i just started it with

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,970
the powering up by the virtual machine

00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:07,220
is running on that host you can see the

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,989
network storage this i want to i want

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,360
you guys to see the console you can

00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:13,879
connect to the concert in this specific

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,639
day by music spice spice is the totem

00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,689
pole that is the optimized for

00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,029
cooperating to your virtual machines

00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:23,629
exactly and see but it's another

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:25,249
protocol and here you can see i'm

00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:26,749
booting the real this is a parcel to the

00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:33,220
virtual machine and started so this is

00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:33,220
like nestle via hope I'm trying to walk

00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:40,610
okay in the meantime till we get the

00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:42,679
console I can also show you something so

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:47,329
for the virtual machine specifically

00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:52,669
that we've created we can add disks and

00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:54,709
ad network you can either this and here

00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:57,410
you can choose what size did work sighs

00:15:54,709 --> 00:16:01,309
disk you want you can choose which

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,980
driver you want but we will value ID it

00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:05,959
ready for its thingy for vision but you

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,579
can be out of place if you want to for

00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,410
example if the mobile you're using is a

00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:12,350
set of the base and you want to get a

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:16,819
good and performance is probably makes

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:21,379
sense to use the air located storage so

00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:24,769
let's get the concert clear the song

00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:26,949
isn't the Dean of service I'm sorry but

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:26,949
that's

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:36,029
okay so this is basically what you need

00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:38,130
to get your vm after learning people

00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:40,620
have time at the end of the slide deck I

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:43,230
would also be able to show you basic

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:47,450
stuff like how you read new interface to

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:52,050
a virtual machine and how you added this

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:55,140
okay I like them understand okay so this

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:57,000
was this is the schedule against like

00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,390
they don't even thought about it it's a

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,640
real fine okay so will allow it to

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,949
physically talking now we're going to go

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,020
from specifically it so obviously we all

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,900
care about sniffing for misty really

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,230
means a lot of things one of the things

00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,540
is this overt is used as there as an

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,189
enterprise-grade solution for that to

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,839
this provided later that I think that's

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:21,150
quite good indication about the

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:25,380
stability of products we have big

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,910
companies and supporting over to think

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,610
that's another good in the kitchen and

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,400
we have an open governance model so when

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:35,010
we're talking about stability it's not

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,929
all about your workflow definitely most

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,670
of it is about your war field but some

00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:40,679
of it is about making sure the project

00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,360
is open source is going to stay there

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:45,600
and not enough to see the company is

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,929
going to be a dominant and only and

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,510
fuller please whatever it wants to go so

00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:54,809
an open governance model which means

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:57,030
which is very make based on net it is a

00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:59,010
good indication for stability so if you

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:02,520
if you want to influence you just have

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:04,710
to come to be a contribute enough it to

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,390
the community and it become part of this

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:12,240
horrible project so I think that's part

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,840
of the building when it comes to regular

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,580
release schedules we have a six month

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,220
schedule in the Oakland we have a race

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,460
every six months we can't we kind of

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,840
realized lately that it's too much time

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,790
between we have too much time between

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,950
religious and we'll try to lower that

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,050
down we're trying to load the cycle for

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:34,080
we must because we think we have enough

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:36,450
feature set on a on the three months

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,910
places so we're probably going to move

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,950
to that very soon last place was like

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,600
few weeks ago which is all the filigree

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,190
and we're looking to

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,860
student for within three months

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,840
hopefully that would happen we have

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,210
stubble is a shin hyun our dream which

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,820
means we try not to get new features

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:59,760
into their main branch just fixing 66

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,250
existing staff and we have the community

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,140
test days well it's always with that's

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,539
what you're doing especially if you get

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,630
last test day was for example anyone how

00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:11,490
to test somebody else's feature request

00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,679
code because that's right it makes me

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,110
and people where all the other feet of

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,780
that where they added to other than in

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,059
addition I was able to find things that

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,539
probably they didn't we decided let me

00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:26,940
think about today's good next point is

00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:30,090
continuous integration on each page in

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,190
exton you have the full test to that is

00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:36,210
being executed and then you get a plus

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:39,570
one for me Garrett is from journeys in

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,549
get it and making sure that your catch

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,010
meets the basic standards we were able

00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:46,110
for networking specifically whatever to

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,630
do it and an additional set of tests

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,429
that was executed on each page they also

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,669
in the VD sm component so there are

00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:57,720
tests spell component in dsm an engine

00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:59,789
and active user community one user that

00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,039
is worth mentioning that the way which

00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:04,860
is there which is a hosting facility

00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:06,720
company in France there is an amazing

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,250
mentioning them is because they provide

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,740
a look with the continuous integration

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:14,610
host they are hosting for us the

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:19,440
continuous integration is else I think

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:21,690
that's for stability functionality there

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,120
are two aspects and when it comes to

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,539
functionality there is the data center

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,580
level functionality and there is the vm

00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:31,350
10-3 clear functionality so when we're

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,220
looking at the data center is quite good

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:38,730
that you have in my in my mind is that

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,380
you have all the functionality for my

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,030
enforcer we can consume it from one

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,970
process if you want to configure low

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,850
storage and you do that form within the

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:52,230
UI we can I can show you later how it is

00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:54,799
done and you you have both is I scuzzy

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,310
which is ok you have blocked if I

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,640
storage and you have

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:01,820
the NFS defy system storage it all can

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,890
be configured with it open and

00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,860
networking we are currently you know

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:11,970
what we currently have a way to control

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:13,860
only segregation by villains and so you

00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,050
can just feel and obviously we don't

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,790
configure the switches for you but other

00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,410
than that we do everything so for

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,870
example on the host there's nothing you

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,740
have to do except for its taking the

00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:27,840
feeling on the logical network entity

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:32,820
producing in a split on the host port

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,980
for with the little kid configuration we

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,920
added an integration with neutral lately

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,810
and I can get it to move it details

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,090
maybe at the end of the session but

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:45,360
generally that enables it to use theory

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:48,090
and VX lon and we are you told if the

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,060
integration is is still quite basic

00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:53,460
integration the little bit services for

00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,380
example of not integrated here and there

00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,870
is work being done to integrate security

00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,710
group but the basic stuff the basic

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,880
connectivity layer to stop is their

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,980
resilience policy you can configure

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,900
there are two processes that comes out

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,670
of the box you know the one of them is

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,710
evenly distributed when you want your

00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:13,230
vocal to be evenly distributed across

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:16,260
the hypervisor and the other one is the

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:20,340
power setting policy so you can use as

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:22,400
less a physical hardware does as you can

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:26,040
and you can say power or the other

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,460
physical cheese this is from a high data

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,770
center level functionality we're looking

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,450
at the pmfl then I missed you configure

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,760
give me the disks of the filter machine

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,950
it is all being deported there in

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,890
oakland and the networking for the

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,230
specific bill traction high availability

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,180
you can market assumption as a highly

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,070
available and of it will be monitoring

00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,440
this filter machine for you and will

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:53,580
make sure that this bill drum machine is

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,740
there is being executed on another host

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,360
in case in case it clashed against the

00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,790
hypervisor is not available for some

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,460
reason nothing bad happens so you have

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,910
this monitoring capability by the

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,130
management hair analysis some fine

00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,810
tuning you can pass a kill my car

00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:14,010
rentals for it

00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:17,520
into the kernel gather then for fine

00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:20,340
tuning stuff today Ojinaga you know it's

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,070
worth a discussing which functionalities

00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:26,390
netafim double kem i thought because it

00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:29,280
said and we child basically just

00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:31,380
different which is just a driven

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,650
functionality we are leveraging whatever

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,000
key p.m. and leave the hospital often so

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,150
the first one is these two you have the

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,130
basin record but you can get in order in

00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:44,130
addition to your day-to-day work is

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:47,270
report on statistics on the capacity and

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:50,460
the usages of your hardware in the past

00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:52,500
give or mass of depends on how you

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,970
define you before so by different you

00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,890
have the in-store database you can

00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,710
install that we both is based on just

00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,660
stepped it all we can create your own

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:04,020
reporting tool based on their history

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,020
databases which has an API a you can use

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,450
the second one this is obviously not kvm

00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:12,050
really okay so the second one is in

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:17,090
porta you get the CPU memory and storage

00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:19,950
you can cut this is the area synoptic

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:23,940
it's about a beginning teacher that is

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:28,890
an edit value' on kvm on the basic for a

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:31,320
machine um but the missing you is the

00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:34,290
networking bit because we as a user you

00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,730
get enough water on the storage and this

00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,920
can never with creative your turn

00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,960
machines there is an aspect that another

00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,080
aspect of water which is more quality of

00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,690
service I can sit them the quality of

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:49,950
service that you want to cap your air

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,870
traffic of a stink of a specific future

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,730
machine off to take all the bandwidth

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,380
that you have you want to make sure it

00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:59,910
is being emitted and cut and

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,070
significantly significant one future

00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,500
that was asked in that aspect for my

00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:06,930
user only is not available yet they

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:10,950
wanted to be able to cut the Phoenix

00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:13,620
traffic only in case and their bandwidth

00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:17,010
is fully utilized so for example if m if

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:21,390
you have 1g a perfect canali and we're

00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:23,220
allocating 100 mega fair p.m. then if

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:26,390
there are no template

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,409
less than 10 times on on the on the

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:30,090
physically connected to the physical

00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:31,950
Nick and I would like the virtual

00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,840
machine to be able to use more than 100

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:37,890
me so I want to cap the virtual machine

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,350
only in case and there is a lot of

00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,850
velvet technically this is something we

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,700
didn't do it yet and I'm not sure if

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:47,490
we're going to I mean I'm not to work

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,080
requirements definitely hilton and kb

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,270
apparently doesn't don't give you

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,240
something figured out definitely doesn't

00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:56,039
also that it keeps ability at this point

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,990
that we have to look into what needs to

00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:05,789
be done be able to expose such features

00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:09,740
so judge migration so all involved we

00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:12,809
have the storage though and we have the

00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,059
kvm and we have the lead build and

00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:17,370
everything everybody allah component has

00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:19,190
their own specific contribution from

00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:21,150
this feature but still there were some

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,780
orchestration level missing that is

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:28,860
specific to a view that was done and

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:31,890
still and then still being it removed we

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,929
have the system scheduler currently no

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,120
but you can write your own policy so I

00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:37,350
as i mentioned that of two pulses out of

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,919
the box but you can write your own

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:43,049
policy and integrate it and use it in a

00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,900
over it's a new feature that was added

00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:48,780
there you fiddle to release so it's

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,789
quite nice you can use anything any

00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:55,130
information that is available in the API

00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:58,440
and then leverage that for scheduling

00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,900
live disappear sighs that's that's the

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,390
ability to definitely resize the disc

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,450
its capability that is not to pay the

00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:10,830
bill and it is available God they think

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:14,700
it's quite the useful in the lately we

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:21,390
had some nevermind so we have the

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:22,980
building's feature ok so we have no

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,049
crystallization level and this is the

00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,929
benefit of a management solution on top

00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:29,520
of the on top of the K p.m. so we

00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:31,950
mentioned the scheduler the PM life

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,840
cycle which is template when you want to

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,220
place a vm you want to create mass of

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,679
virtual machines based on the

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:41,140
I'm on the same imagine the same p.m.

00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,720
configuration same amount of memory the

00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,490
same amount or the same type of cpu now

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,409
you have to do is create a template and

00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:50,409
then you can create mass future machine

00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:53,640
space on that deadline in the snatcher

00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:56,110
snatchers functionality in over you can

00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,780
when you listen your application that

00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:01,780
you want to take a snapshot a point in

00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:04,000
time when to recover to all be able to

00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:07,030
change configuration from that point and

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,789
then go back to into a well-known stable

00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:11,919
and point in time then you just use

00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:13,630
snapshots detected snapshot you play

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,549
with your virtual machine you go back to

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:18,220
the snatchers and then you get it all

00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:20,620
back for you which is kind of stimulus

00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,720
stages take this vm that we have to

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,750
offer you know bill you can start on

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,429
philtrum status bill trap machine do

00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,530
whenever you wanted a future machine

00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:32,919
when you stop it then it goes back to

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:35,049
some kind of a pool and it has no stake

00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,840
goes back to the way it was when you got

00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:40,330
it the two looking at the class of

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,789
students that you want to get to assign

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,770
the future machines to them that's why

00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:46,270
they're useful feature the start with

00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,789
the clean image they can do whatever

00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,530
they want they can wait the vm whence

00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:54,880
the vm is stopped and everything goes

00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:56,860
back to no one at this production than

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,830
the other mentioned that in his session

00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,850
earlier and liberal so one other thing

00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:05,620
you can you can get stay in KPM is

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,659
protecting your date your disk so k vm

00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,059
is 0 is the way off senior healer

00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:12,429
machine but in the management Liam we

00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:15,429
have to be aware if the disk is being

00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:17,230
used by modernist single virtual machine

00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:19,690
at the same time as definitely closer

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,730
for option as the management and we

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,130
would like to be able you would like and

00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,690
we are doing that actually preventing to

00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:28,020
virtual machine starting at the same

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:31,539
time and lighting to the same image a

00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:34,210
concurrently so we have a dis protection

00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:35,950
mechanism if you have a high

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,990
availability as a mentioned earlier is

00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:41,890
something that is built on top of K p.m.

00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:44,559
and a porta I mentioned them oh and one

00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:48,630
last thing is the MLA we have the

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:51,840
multi-layered need adminstration you can

00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:54,620
manage who can access to each VM and who

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,120
can access which results in general m

00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,590
enovia so and you can also delegate

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,510
aspiration so if your domain

00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,610
administrator and you want the network

00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:05,340
administrator to be able to control and

00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,900
meet the networking stack then what you

00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:12,230
will do probably create a dedicated

00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:15,480
networking administrator vol and and

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,690
that's all will be used for for the user

00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:23,760
that is going to configure the network

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:33,470
mhm I can barely hit it mr. being

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:36,030
achieved is back so what is the H a

00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,460
totally fire variable in what way is

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:41,040
that ok if you ever have an ability that

00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,200
means that we that the amendment layer

00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,180
is monitoring your virtual machine and

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,820
then in case it crashes if you started

00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:50,420
it on another hypervisor it restarts the

00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,990
Sabre pushing yes the save your changes

00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:56,910
ok what do you keep the same thing

00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:59,340
starting the memory stuff well if it

00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:01,980
crashed probably the state is lost but

00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,720
that's not hyperbole yes what I'll go

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,670
with you it's um it's high availability

00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,450
to some degree it's not like active

00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:14,370
active when you get the full a memory

00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:16,890
yeah smoke just make sure the vm is

00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:19,920
running service is available in the am

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,530
and downtime so dense the watchdog the

00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,750
emulation available available in kvm

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:28,280
right now so we have another feature

00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:31,710
that is a letter a gene take a PM and

00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,210
and waited watchdog and you can choose

00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,790
which action you want to do on the

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,230
specific vm basis but that's good if

00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,850
they have your visor is still running

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,100
and only something bad happened to

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:43,020
specifically tailwheel trebuchet an

00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,660
application that the gay to death is not

00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,580
responsive but it's not as possible etc

00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:52,230
but the high availability general

00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:55,280
mechanism that's for general early for

00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,280
half of our own beer

00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:03,430
okay and those are things that things

00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,140
that we currently need and they are not

00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,780
there but i think i've already mentioned

00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,730
inequality of service novian see okay so

00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:14,380
we added a feature in Oviatt lately

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:16,420
which is no VNC um it choosing tipping

00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,900
it using it is using web service which

00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:22,540
was not a melting Absalom kvm but now I

00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:25,150
think it is outside like few days ago

00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,130
take it is available in apps to give um

00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,330
so we should be able to get at this

00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,660
point we have some kind of the

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:33,990
workaround we do under hosted on their

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,660
host level we we we have a specific

00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:40,360
planned or separate that's translating

00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:44,320
everything to PNC and I think you lose

00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,820
against in kvm around snapshot the kind

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,500
of functionality that we have when you

00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,960
take a snapshot with you with the lamb

00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:53,410
which is being built to be able to

00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,900
provide a specific and good to cover

00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,850
leave em to the original theater

00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,550
machines if you had soaked allocate

00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:03,070
weekly milk of kvm and i'm not sure in

00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:06,010
which layer requires to actually posted

00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:08,950
via find us from the user point of view

00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,480
it's cut it's kind of painful so this is

00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:13,270
something we're looking to get

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,910
improvements from i believe with Roku

00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:17,110
p.m. i'm not sure which level it is i'm

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,760
just using a factor than the

00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:24,360
intelligence CD me he didn't have our

00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:26,530
first version for Emma's right okay

00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,500
turkey lecture from going through the

00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:31,810
architecture I would like to discuss

00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:36,640
some of the customization options you

00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:38,560
have in orbit so there are two places

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,270
you can customize actually there are

00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,760
three places you can customize all these

00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:47,080
days you can customize it on the node

00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,790
level em what world VD sm is executing

00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,440
so generally noted we have this

00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:53,620
centralized management solution and we

00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,530
have a smooth agent on each written in

00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,810
Python on each of the hyper vessel and

00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:00,850
he's the one who's generating everything

00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,560
he's configuring the storage in the

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:05,950
network in other the duck is also

00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,320
handing the vm life cycle if the vm life

00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,300
cycle it basically means grazing the

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,410
dome xml

00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:15,810
that is fast later to a tilaka so what

00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:19,679
we doin able today is too bad to add

00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:22,860
some kind of the hook de55 fun to

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,620
manipulate the Dom XML just before we

00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,600
passed it to leave it they take full

00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,940
customization mechanism if you want to

00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,950
leverage a little feature that is not

00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:36,150
yet available in of it that would be a

00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:39,590
good way to do that another practical

00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:42,750
option is in the UI we have we have the

00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:45,210
uim mechanism in place to be able to

00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:47,940
create new tabs as you saw earlier there

00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,950
are tasks for the big basic entities but

00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:53,040
you created can place you on top of

00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:55,800
things your little steep for a on in toy

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,480
so this specifically is an integration

00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,770
with Foreman if you familiar with that

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,220
so how many people do you have for me

00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:09,030
with Roman yeah okay so maybe there

00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:11,190
should be more popular and yes okay so

00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:13,410
you can get events and monotonic

00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,480
statistics from the host and this is

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,730
really an example of you I integration

00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,070
where you can see the nagios and the

00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:22,470
statistics is from the hosting a cough

00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:25,440
and the advance from the hose do you

00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:29,660
have a way to add your own kind of Maine

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,430
pavan laptops which is the UI extension

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:39,840
as I mentioned you can also customize

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:42,060
the yo set up with them and with we

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,610
mentioned the UI at the scheduler okay

00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,350
so we you can also like your scheduling

00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,360
mechanism and hopefully going forward

00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:50,660
you have it customized more things in

00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,580
their men in the simplest management

00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:57,930
going forward that's something we want

00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:01,730
to go hey on okay just a few bits about

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,730
architecture and that's it

00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:11,190
okay so for a really high level point of

00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,750
view is is to have the engine which is

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,610
the centralized management written in

00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,410
Java and as I mentioned the video

00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:19,320
sembène be part of the agent on the

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:23,690
hooks on the client side you have a GWT

00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:28,260
based you are and you can use all the

00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:31,020
all the ls base a client that I

00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,390
mentioned it earlier we have the Java

00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:37,170
which is using database post for the

00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,870
systems specifically posters we are

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,040
relative we have integration within

00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:44,100
generally woods and the end of the leg

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,250
to me specifically also with the active

00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:49,860
directory I mean any elder provider

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,510
could be used for education other than

00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:55,320
that you cannot see this act directly

00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:56,670
the engine is exposes the rest api with

00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,380
which it can use within different

00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:04,290
clients and i'm the host tells the VD sm

00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:06,390
agent and you can run a PC Windows and

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:08,820
Linux virtual machines in each bang you

00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,770
have a gas station the guest agent is

00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,990
used to get it to leave information from

00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:16,440
within the guests for example using that

00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:19,260
tool that it networking devices that the

00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,600
guest has been using that to a received

00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,870
applications that the guests have and

00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:30,900
for Cynthia sign on from the user poker

00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:33,330
don't phunk useful we have spice is not

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,390
an open water it's a separate open

00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:40,020
source project budget it's tailored for

00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:42,660
and optimized a vocalization you can use

00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,450
fast I love for me absorb from a windows

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,550
land and we have the storage the local

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,680
storage is basically to utilize the disc

00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,800
that you have in your hypervisor so if

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,630
you use a hostess a hypervisor and you

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,580
want to be able to utilize this mutiny

00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:59,160
the longer the stories would be the way

00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:02,760
to go and they shared storage which it

00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:08,220
which is which enables our work faster a

00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:10,140
vm regulation and we currently have a

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:13,220
storage live migration so it should be

00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:17,580
able for the local storage back p.m.

00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,150
Dennis in the gas level while there are

00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,460
all

00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,829
our virtual drivers for improving

00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,339
performance like the fifth I on net a

00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:29,849
rocket else casa de not till I believe

00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:32,839
and the plan one device and the new

00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:35,339
device is not poor performance to talk a

00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:36,329
inflating a balloon and deflating the

00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:40,140
balloon to make sure you have enough

00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:42,240
removing yourself and there's the filter

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,460
of cereal driver the guests agent is

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,859
using that if it sells web agent and

00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,450
this is all lining other guests we have

00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:56,210
a guest agent both fully locks and

00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:56,210
windows dimension ok so to summarize

00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:03,900
over to the management searching it's

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:07,829
built on top of lipids and kvm as lower

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:11,400
level lives levels it offers a lot of

00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:14,119
orchestration level features and it's an

00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:19,829
open source quite stable long-term

00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:23,240
solution and I think you'd enjoy using

00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:28,079
that if you want to fry it and I have

00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:31,260
like yes baby sticks and you can use to

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,349
just you put you I'll obviously I mean

00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,789
when you put it as es video open up and

00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:38,849
running in your machine like I show you

00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:40,980
in the demo and if we have time I'll

00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:44,609
it's like the questions but if we have

00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:47,400
time I want to extend the devil and show

00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:50,549
you some some of the other stuff is you

00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:54,990
get you can use so many questions before

00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:59,130
I'm yeah so could you summarize the main

00:39:54,990 --> 00:40:02,940
benefit versus open sky why I mean why

00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:05,160
we eat over over here open spam okay I

00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,260
think it depends on the kind type of

00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,089
goal or you're going to use you're going

00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,960
to deploy on your on your environment

00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:15,900
you probably have the pats vs kettle I'm

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,430
the analogy well when you care about

00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,559
your virtual machines when you care

00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,700
about the state and when the virtual

00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:22,710
machine that the kitchens the

00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:26,160
transmitting your virtual machine is not

00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:27,750
two stages it's like a fat you give it a

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,309
name you care about it you want to make

00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,260
sure this specific type of this

00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:34,680
particular machine is is

00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:36,420
allari for some reason then you use open

00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,970
which is more relaxing than

00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:41,250
neutralization solution if you have like

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,020
a more mass deployment and like the

00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,360
cattle when you don't give a name to

00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:48,360
each one and it's time if one goes down

00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:50,340
then you can bring I'm available

00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,990
damages if one dirction machine goes

00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,270
down then you want to just launch

00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:57,060
another each a machine that you don't

00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,500
get about the specific details and also

00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:02,070
that leap well that your application

00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:04,260
would be cloudy well which means idle

00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,630
status though I don't that configuration

00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,200
is it slowly well so you can configure

00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:12,720
it from the outside and keep your inner

00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,770
application without a steak then you

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,260
would use probably OpenStack although

00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:21,690
the ball is it's not like a shot clear

00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,520
decision this type of workload is

00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:26,340
definitely over the district and of

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,110
course notice is open standing so they

00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,050
could get their kind of interchangeable

00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:33,240
I would say that you should look into

00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:36,720
what functionality you actually need and

00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,090
then what type of local you are capable

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,070
to execute on that virtualized

00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:49,370
environment and then you would be able

00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:51,720
to make a good clear choice yeah

00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:55,380
commercial environment such as here we

00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,860
go and is it advisable to use over and

00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:01,860
follow we are still good okay so first

00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:04,230
of all it's about dogs than an amount if

00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:06,690
you're looking at about Vienna it's the

00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:09,570
pricing if is my child a little bit

00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:12,870
right other than that and then i would

00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:14,310
say that always is inspired or was i

00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:21,330
have to be able to provide this much

00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:22,800
functionality else as vmware back yeah

00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:26,040
well that's the i thought don't be

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,630
appointed yeah well it's not a monopoly

00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,580
and you don't have a vendor rocky which

00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,620
is obvious by the fact that you use an

00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,680
open source solution and you can also

00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:37,680
know that we for example we also have

00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,150
all the community activity around us and

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,730
if you need a specific feature you can

00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,609
go and ask for it even the community

00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,739
level and engine

00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:46,960
would be engaged in providing a specific

00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:48,910
or mark according to your needs and not

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,180
something that vm one is diving and you

00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:54,190
cannot have any influence on this kind

00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,230
of dictate for the function f king i

00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:00,460
would say that availability they are

00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:02,200
still yeah there are also ducks i'm not

00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,999
sure about specifically about high

00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,789
availability of your virtual machine i'm

00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:09,759
not joke there is the gap may be so just

00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:12,910
just never have bought hearts abilities

00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:15,430
that one gap that or do not average for

00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:17,920
their forum which really talks over to

00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:20,470
the she's having a console great so that

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,049
some justice in community there is a

00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:26,769
Pegasus body perform i think is still

00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:30,519
not be available in to your cover and

00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:34,509
say that the important eighty percent of

00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:36,579
being world Gary I think we need to take

00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:43,289
this discussion offline yeah the next

00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:43,289
presenter rocket yeah thank you so much

00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:48,569
