Description: 
	Have you ever wondered how KVM is used in a full blown Data Center virtualization solution? oVirt is an open virtualization project which enables the management of multi-host, multi-tenant virtual data centers, including high availability, VM and storage live migration, storage and network management, system scheduler and more. oVirt provides an integration point for several open source virtualization technologies, including kvm, libvirt, spice, oVirt node and numerous OpenStack components such as Neutron and Glance. The session will provide an introduction to the oVirt project and shed light on how a data center administrator's actions in a web UI are translated into KVM commands running on the hypervisors.
