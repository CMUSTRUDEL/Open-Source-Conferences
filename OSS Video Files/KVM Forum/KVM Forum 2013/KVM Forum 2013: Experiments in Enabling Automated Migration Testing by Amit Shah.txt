It is currently not possible to ensure changes to the devices in QEMU don't break migration from older QEMU versions. There are no automated tests, and no simple ways to automate such testing. Tools could be written that help identify whether two given QEMU binaries or source trees are compatible for migration. The scope for such tools is quite large -- tools that check for guest ABI compliance and tools that check for device emulation changes (and especially changes that are migration-unfriendly). A static checker that doesn't require any live state is helpful as well. This talk will highlight current infrastructure shortcomings to enable such testing, providing scope for discussions on ways to tackle the issues and also illustrate progress made in writing such tools.
