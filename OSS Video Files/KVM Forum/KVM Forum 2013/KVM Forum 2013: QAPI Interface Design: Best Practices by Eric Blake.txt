In qemu, the QAPI programming interface, as exposed via the QMP Monitor, is essential for reliable programmatic control from higher-level applications (such as libvirt), and for maintaining interface guarantees across qemu upgrades. In this presentation, Eric Blake will review best practices in adding a new interface to QAPI, such as choice of naming, proper documentation, and planning for the possibility of future extension. The presentation will also discuss issues with introspection, and how best to allow management applications learn when features have been backported, rather than having to rely on hard-coded version checks.
