In the 3 years since it was founded, the OpenStack project has grown very rapidly, attracting a range of contributors from across the open source ecosystem, and looks on track to assume a dominant position in the open source cloud computing space. At the core of OpenStack, the Nova sub-project provides a compute platform able to leverage a number of virtualization technologies, with KVM as the most prominent choice. Daniel, as a member of the Nova core team, aims to ensure that KVM remains the most feature rich virtualization technology integrated in Nova. The talk will outline the overall OpenStack architecture with a focus on Nova, the capabilities of KVM as used in Nova, how KVM integrates with the OpenStack storage and networking sub-projects, and what developments to expect in future releases of OpenStack.
