yes let's go thank you and i don't mean

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,550
maybe smoke example surgical resident

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,359
it's my colleague involve our topic

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,970
today is not figurations on the right

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:31,650
i'll be talking about why everything is

00:00:26,970 --> 00:01:13,860
crap and a blessed Kevin report on

00:00:31,650 --> 00:01:15,720
what's being done to fix it I think what

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,259
the if I chose the topic careful I

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,360
thought it's a consistent on that and if

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,540
I can Rebecca is provided by the block

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,430
ayo mottely on the front and a small

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:31,710
house in commercial device to the gas

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:34,619
system ie they scorn SD card and the

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,140
back end is affecting the content of the

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,659
block device on the house so here's the

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:47,100
image file progress and not kill

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:49,439
Morrison this is stuff like that the

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,320
next life I'll take you from a player's

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,560
humble beginnings to the rather more

00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:02,399
complicated stay of today the way will

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:06,570
see various crap so humble beginnings

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,959
great what why humbly in it all I want

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,910
is a mistype so how r can this be

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,300
working around the divisor on the image

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:20,710
well turns out it's not very hard is so

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:23,500
easy at least it is about in tight once

00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:29,920
where every device anybody was

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:33,700
interested in but a crash surprise on

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,420
type it all sometimes and which fire

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,610
isn't all I really one so a long time

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,900
ago someone it felt the need to control

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:48,040
this complete geometry so how can this

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:52,680
be just add another option so meet one

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,680
of my favorite options in you muah said

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,840
second box if you go on like this maybe

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:09,190
we might end up with ten more options

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,110
that we like so let's add one more

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,710
option to end all this time with lots of

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:20,200
progress and that s part so too easy you

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:25,840
have an aura is a kind of device one it

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:28,990
got kinda hard to say which one and only

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:38,230
give parents like geometry firing

00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:40,780
whatever so sexy it will safely cannot

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,700
make fun of its guy because that hasn't

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:49,060
so long ago we probably seen in the

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:51,640
rumen wouldn't remember anyway and this

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,840
keeps me up like sometimes better than

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:59,500
other guys as the controller I a lot is

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,910
the iris address and our can the be just

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:07,260
add a parameter I can tell you make fun

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:11,440
of this car because it describes me a

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:16,630
second thought this format is only valid

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,250
for one kind of device and block layer

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,650
which our faces the rock layers

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,060
knowledge split this process only

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,260
relative this kind of device to

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:29,170
knowledge about devices

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,240
from it many more coronas we really want

00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:39,880
to pay knowledge of on overland is La

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:42,250
Jolla nah not really promise meth lab be

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,580
the first one in again and its really f

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:49,450
configuring fronting so is our solution

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,960
the greater right good job again by

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:55,240
three okay invite you on then we

00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,880
configure the front end the usual i have

00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:08,040
used nine to refer the second that's the

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:15,190
problem complete problem is all covered

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:17,850
as I stared intriguing back end to it is

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:23,860
really sign for a simple kind of second

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:26,919
formula you can do with it you can

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:30,370
select the Thomas flyer comment you can

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:33,160
configure a photo from the file you can

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,950
configure the lock layer in general

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:41,380
great delight in hand them off of a

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:44,050
product and the next few slides I've

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:48,010
presented a couple of examples going

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:51,300
from really simple to not so simple we

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:55,270
are we see how that simple idea

00:05:51,300 --> 00:06:00,040
successively breaks down here's a simple

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:03,220
68 pics after raw over five then it's

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,169
normal wrong file to the image block

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,880
Lacey's to the image perfectly normal

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:11,800
size that I can make a pic with five

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,610
protocol great two objects are you 500

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:19,330
small objects and roll normal object

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:22,540
both are not drivers and this works fine

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:25,570
the opting here is the book or more

00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:30,419
basically there's nothing if he is built

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:30,419
from a local mall but that's okay

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:41,530
here's a more interesting it's a network

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:46,979
block device and it's same as the

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:54,190
process is illegal but I own one before

00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:56,979
but not my thesis colon I said okay it

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,710
is in the filing everything less of the

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:02,979
colonists economy and everything by the

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:05,919
total is an argument that protocol the

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:09,699
single argument for that program so it

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,639
raises every photograph object have a

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,949
password on the argument and the

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,740
protocol driver again cause instead of

00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:23,560
the argument into cloud nine and four

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:28,449
one two three four so both block layout

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:35,259
for good of the value of y is less there

00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:40,509
yes first problem is not accidental and

00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:43,180
everyone is is own happiness and all

00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:47,680
this passing of our balance is very

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:50,469
handsome as you eat and that's why don't

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,370
have the right at month in creepy or we

00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:58,860
can have it in the human model also

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,860
break on the new food code of silence

00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:07,719
next puzzle you also applies here in

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,259
fact do a simple five horrible but this

00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:13,270
time we put a few colorful top so we

00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:16,210
give you signal as before we get to

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,729
office almond and oracle and roger

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:22,060
refers to the keep our image which

00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:26,789
contains the Delta and here we have

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:30,699
another object and that cruel to

00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:34,380
assessing image now where does not come

00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:38,440
from well I didn't get to configure it

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:45,630
we're here because our new year is I can

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:48,510
select the forum that gives color and 14

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:53,730
so all raishin here and there comes from

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:57,420
the decking model upon the cute aha why

00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:03,720
would anybody want to clear anything

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:09,060
there so yes you did we say 12 run em

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:12,630
you with Nemo so you can open and

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,210
impiety want to pass this file

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:18,090
descriptors exactly the files you wanted

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,700
to use so and set things absolutely

00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,290
can't eat anything else that's pretty

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,190
much required to get the base mileage

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:30,380
out of acid innocent and yes we're fine

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,380
except you can't parts of a king st

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:45,570
libraries nanami next example lots of

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:51,180
all the more interesting protocol you

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:53,640
know the drill after packing the rest is

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,970
proud by the protocol driver this driver

00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:02,250
clock back a need to say what it does

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:04,500
it's rejecting I or errors so it needs

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,140
conversation forever that tells it how

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,800
to make up things and it gets it from

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,230
between the children's and all the rest

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:17,400
it takes left halves it back to the

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:23,910
papaya to create an inferior protocol so

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:26,010
first what depart act as a filter now

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,640
you may think that through this may be a

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:32,670
generally useful concept should be

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,100
hacked into each protocol let's 12 acres

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:39,630
at a time you'd be right but that

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:43,020
concerts doesn't quite exist yet here

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:47,070
it's another example for facebook

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:50,070
twitter i apparently i have problem less

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,770
you follow I all right if I operations

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,680
things like that right now this bike is

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:59,420
a lock-up they can only apply at the

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:03,290
root well in what it be it is

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:06,300
that we can put anywhere to the root

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:11,220
misfit bus everything is going to let

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:15,120
image how many we put it here and there

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:22,170
if you not only I open to the remote X

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:32,790
file this isn't quite as formal of a

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:36,270
powerful anymore final example is imaged

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:42,290
rating for each region is we want to

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:42,290
take a pleasure a certain point type

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:54,870
whilst the devices in use is being

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:59,100
written we both how to decide and we set

00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:02,430
up a droplet copies that intercept right

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:06,210
to the image and everything that's about

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:08,370
we originate safe into the car so from

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:12,480
the front end point of view everything

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:15,150
works as normal what if you look at this

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,470
totally cow nothing changes in the SS

00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:21,150
natural and then we can you put the

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,030
internal liability server of Mickey

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:26,850
splice throttle into the middle and we

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:29,220
have external access access on external

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,160
program to a point in time steps up in

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:36,540
give you two things that they go right

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,960
from this life we are reconfiguring the

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:46,520
backend wirelessly we used and the

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,520
second one is anxious because to roost I

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:58,779
put it all together

00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:00,670
we got a must be frosted you live notin

00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:05,440
rapper frost are instances from then

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:11,829
again off stuff like that we rollin over

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:15,490
every note this is my profit and Jason

00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:19,569
Jason is fading last reason we can be

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:21,459
rough there in the sprite graphs my TV

00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:27,220
is offered on the command line is a

00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:32,560
generality we think that this I need to

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:37,690
check model but to be honest we are

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:40,110
moderate and with that I'd like to end

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,110
of the floor

00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:41,709
sweet okay um let's try to see if we can

00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:46,899
do anything about the progress that

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:49,420
Marcus mentioned over the years um

00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,970
basically the first time we started the

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,999
whole discussion about these problems

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,670
what's in doesn't end oh um years three

00:14:54,999 --> 00:15:01,149
years mostly this cutting things I'm

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:05,170
here they are fixing some arcs making

00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:09,550
some improvements to the code but we

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:13,120
also had many proposals of what we could

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:16,809
implement and one of the favorite

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,550
dancers that I could give good oh but in

00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:22,689
order to do is probably we need logged

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:28,870
it and so yeah many people have probably

00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:32,259
gathered fun so the thing tied up and

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:35,679
the project grew bigger and bigger and

00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:40,029
we have just accumulated stuff um I know

00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:44,139
that name locked it so it means it is

00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:48,269
something like oh yeah if I want to fix

00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:56,470
that what do we have to fix everything

00:15:48,269 --> 00:16:00,610
right um sometimes this year Here I am I

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:03,160
actually started to ended things that

00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:06,279
because the mountain has an too big and

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,950
it seemed clear that we would never

00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:15,760
actually thought the whole thing as 14

00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:20,890
so I just shot it somewhere and the

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:24,070
somewhere was the command line max Smith

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:26,140
that currently all of the protocol take

00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:29,680
their options included in the file name

00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:34,560
and so that was one thing where started

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:39,310
to jakes thing and actually allowed to

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,470
give protocol separate options so now

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:45,010
instead of saying every code and loaded

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:47,470
has colon port number yes several

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,200
options 50 driver let's elect to the

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:54,850
protocol and yes the 50 s equals 0 to

00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:56,770
host and none of these values that you

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,900
give are actually parse that if you have

00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,340
a client in there it's just the code on

00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,530
it doesn't have any special meaning oh

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,630
yeah and as you can see an example I'm

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,730
by the court has a default now which

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,520
wasn't possible before we kissed yeah

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:16,270
its strict index you have had to have

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:21,150
two colons and which the very field so

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,150
now we have a better structure done

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,540
right this is what happened if you had

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:31,090
occurred in the file name if you get

00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,340
finally closed faster than 80 to kick a

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,840
20 it would take at as a protocol name

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:40,300
and you would just get an error um

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,310
similar trouble of course the more

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,550
trouble of course if you have the code

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:54,700
is not in file name that in gypsum other

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:57,040
options to the driver yeah they're there

00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,440
were in some places some hacks to get

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,140
around the problem for their works no

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,940
consistent way to actually add a video

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:08,410
across all for the co-drivers micros all

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,540
options so um yeah like I said cones or

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:16,570
no don't interpret if their children it

00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:20,160
just means Cola another thing that we

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,160
had worse was that

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:27,470
it's the only protocol drivers like nvd

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,960
or raw whatever then actually get to see

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,330
the file name so this is very food

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,860
specified option but if you had an

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:38,539
option to a form a driver like you care

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:40,640
to there was simply in a way to option

00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:43,610
because Pikachu doesn't even feel the

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:49,520
financer it can do able things and pasta

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:52,460
filing permit from it so whatever is

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,529
reusing the new options for protocol

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:58,700
awesome the same infrastructure allow

00:18:54,529 --> 00:19:01,970
the flow up to specify options to format

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,630
drivers so we now can say lady wreck it

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:08,029
was on for cheaper to image for example

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:10,399
so these options are on a per block

00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:15,250
databases the po2 will provide different

00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:15,250
options than say vmdk or all whatever

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,029
backing files we already heard why it's

00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:29,179
important to configure for baking files

00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:31,730
so now even new options we would have

00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:34,820
structured options we can go to the

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:38,270
backing file and save back in touch 505

00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:42,320
name equals something else which is

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:45,409
actually overriding there's a pecking

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,760
file name that is written in the kicker

00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:50,630
to header of the image that we're

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,840
opening so we can still have a cute

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:56,390
cartoon file which has a backing pilot

00:19:52,840 --> 00:20:00,260
which is particularly so if you open it

00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:02,990
with GM mg or some other tool it's an

00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:07,159
enormous filing and when the drugs used

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:11,470
it for chi meo to start a vm it can just

00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:11,470
override it and use the trial instead

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:38,590
back in top again dodge whatever yes

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:52,669
this way right yeah the logical size yes

00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:55,669
what about it no I mean the image just

00:20:52,669 --> 00:21:04,269
act a given size so it's not runtime

00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:06,320
option if it has a coma yeah that's

00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:08,269
that's the same person that is useful

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,909
all of the zinc a meal you can escape

00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:18,289
that by a double cover it's ugly invalid

00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:20,450
at least additional options actly

00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:22,870
because if each protocol driver was

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,679
interpreting the co inspired by just so

00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:28,850
the rules were different between

00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:33,250
different pop drivers to combat it might

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,250
not be nice that ethic is consistent

00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:46,970
right so next step is after F extending

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:49,549
the command line to take options to to

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,610
format to obstructed options for

00:21:49,549 --> 00:22:00,039
protocols and to access the begging file

00:21:52,610 --> 00:22:02,470
options we want to do the same in EMP so

00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:06,409
when you want to do a gimpy comment

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:10,460
basically the same requirements as we

00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:14,389
had for the strike we want to take

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:18,950
structured data which is exactly what

00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:22,490
kmph it's jason or jason and it's just

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:26,299
not just the final string like the

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:29,600
strife is 40 which configures don't need

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:32,600
a back end um which is basically the

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,860
same as if you use under stripe is equal

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,600
to none um

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:41,160
which creates block devices without

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:46,559
animatics for example if you have the

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:48,809
human monitor and you use dry path that

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,750
block bag and that you created this way

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:55,650
will automatically disappear once you

00:22:51,750 --> 00:23:00,600
unlock a few light no matter if the user

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:01,890
or the pure still wants to use that I

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,010
don't you attach it to a different

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:07,950
device or two to run a blog job from it

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:11,040
or whatever so this is something that

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:17,780
should really be in the control of the

00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:23,490
user so we now have blocked of apps

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:28,110
finally which basically met the options

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:30,960
of their strife that never fear to only

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,419
to the back end we are destined to Jason

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,500
so there's a whole begging dog packing

00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:41,570
thing actually becomes nested chasing

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,570
structures it turns out rather nicely

00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:49,020
right and we only include the long term

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:52,790
supportable options though for some

00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:56,100
options either where we don't yet know

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:59,790
what to write ap is they are not exposed

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:03,870
yet or we also have some things like I

00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:07,350
or shortening or copy a bit where we

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:10,169
decided that the problem I can actually

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:15,080
model them would be a block filter as we

00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:19,770
have seen before in which are used to be

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:23,640
options for a test drive before block if

00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:26,490
that doesn't actually provide this so

00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:33,330
that we still have to live in freedom to

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:35,400
change the interfaces we need also we

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:39,929
don't support any of the network drivers

00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,270
because there's still uncertainty about

00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:46,820
how to best represent the network

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:49,370
addresses in TMP we have a

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:55,639
yeah it's consistently across all of the

00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:57,769
gym pika maps but you can see in the

00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:59,840
queue Imperium that's basically exactly

00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:03,950
what you can say on the command line so

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:09,500
I need driver file same options SF in

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:13,429
their stripes just in JT this one is a

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,679
bit more interesting you can see again

00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:19,100
driver you always need to specify that

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:22,940
again just specify the top level here we

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,799
also have a backing thing except instead

00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,240
of taking the backing file from the

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:32,690
image file we all write it and say we

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,480
want to use that teachers so that

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:40,850
network ten times the file descriptor is

00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:46,789
dead and then we can give even more

00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:50,539
complex right as long as we have trees

00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:53,330
um things are easy because Jason

00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:55,730
basically provide streets we have these

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:59,299
massive structures exactly this backing

00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:05,450
up backing up style thing so that's easy

00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:08,450
and if we have more complicated rap what

00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,490
is do is to just separately define

00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:16,909
multiple block devices and then

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:18,679
referenced by name um yeah this brings

00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:23,210
some interesting challenges with it

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:26,299
because currently we we can always

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:29,929
assume that the only block driver states

00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:33,379
that have a name at the top level dr.

00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:41,360
every state so the user doesn't have any

00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:46,750
way to our to to change things somewhere

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:49,720
in the middle of the 30 and what to do

00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:52,190
we've managed to actually hook up things

00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,529
music can access the things in the

00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:59,299
middle of the tree so we need to make

00:26:54,529 --> 00:27:00,530
sure that um you can really break things

00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:05,450
this way

00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:07,670
and and once they have several names and

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:12,860
you create them separately they start

00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:14,060
getting a life cycle still it is just

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,210
different from the model that we

00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:30,830
currently have so this is let's

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:35,390
challenge the psf he we don't have

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:37,750
commands yet to change options after the

00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:41,480
fact after the plot device is created

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:43,820
but I mean it's the logical step so yeah

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:48,650
should you need a ride I think we could

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:52,550
take another right so um so the next

00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:56,200
steps in that block of Eddie's there so

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:59,480
we need to convert for more options now

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,720
because if you want to access options

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,010
while back in dot option name they

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,560
actually need to be converted to using

00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:10,160
new infrastructure do there's something

00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:13,310
to be done as I said network protocols

00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:17,690
are missing so more drivers to be

00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:21,200
converted exactly what I currently ever

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:23,900
accept just that we need to get rid of

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,670
assumptions so that we can build complex

00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:31,850
crafts and plug failures finally require

00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:35,530
some work as well so these are the next

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:46,120
topics in dock device configuration

00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:46,120

absolutely i mean that's exactly that's

00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:40,480
