In this talk we would like to report our experience in building a high packet rate, high throughput datapath for virtual machines. Using qemu/kvm as a test platform, we have developed paravirtualized versions of e1000, added support to QEMU for the netmap framework, and improved the qemu datapath so that we can reach over 5~Mpps between two virtual machines when applications in the guest use the netmap API, and over 1~Mpps when using netperf or other socket-based applications.
