For several years now, the oVirt project is leveraging KVM and relevant technologies (ksm, etc) in data center virtualizations. Being a mature and feature reach, oVirt not takes another step forward with introducing Quality of Service management. This presentation will review recent oVirt improvements in the areas of memory and network QoS management. The first part will discuss the memory and networking QoS features from the frontend and API point of view. The second part will have a special focus on how memory overcommitment works and how it can be configured to efficiently utilize server resources using KSM and Balloon policies in MoM (Memory overcommitment manager). The last part will be dedicated to the new multi policy mechanisms in MoM and how to leverage them for a more fine grained memory policy tuning.
