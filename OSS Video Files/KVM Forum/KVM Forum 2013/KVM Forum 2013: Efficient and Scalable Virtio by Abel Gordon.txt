Virtio is the most popular I/O virtualization model because it enables KVM to interpose on the guest's I/O at a reasonable performance cost. This interposition is required to implement useful virtualization features such as file-based images and live migration. Both QEMU's user-space and vhost's in-kernel virtio frameworks used to achieve acceptable performance but current trend towards multi-core systems and towards faster networks are exposing the inefficiencies and scalability problems of these virtio back-ends. In this talk, we will start by describing the causes for the virtio overhead and discuss why today's back-ends do not scale with the number of cores, number of virtual machines, faster networks and faster block devices. Finally, we will describe ELVIS, a new model which improved virtio performance by 1.2xâ€"3x, approaching and in some cases exceeding SR-IOV performance.
