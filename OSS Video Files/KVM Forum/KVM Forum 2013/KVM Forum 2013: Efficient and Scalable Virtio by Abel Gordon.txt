Virtio is the most popular I/O virtualization model because it enables KVM to interpose on the guest's I/O at a reasonable performance cost. This interposition is required to implement useful virtualization features such as file-based images and live migration. Both QEMU's user-space and vhost's in-kernel virtio frameworks used to achieve acceptable performance but current trend towards multi-core systems and towards faster networks are exposing the inefficiencies and scalability problems of these virtio back-ends. In this talk, we will start by describing the causes for the virtio overhead and discuss why today's back-ends do not scale with the number of cores, number of virtual machines, faster networks and faster block devices. Finally, we will describe ELVIS, a new model which improved virtio performance by 1.2xâ€"3x, approaching and in some cases exceeding SR-IOV performance.

start with a with home motivation that

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,769
guess you will probably agree with me

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,389
but what would like to use accurate data

00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:18,779
and we would like to use with a girl

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:21,689
because we have likely that um uses

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,369
linux to intercept all the io traffic

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,480
coming from limited that people like

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:30,269
software-defined Network individual

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,279
networks five base images support line

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,020
the corrections Busan around this

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,360
something cute is that but there are

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,980
also the prison's actually not to use

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:44,149
scripts that the limitations or

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:49,579
maximization we need English more

00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:52,620
performance yes if you care about

00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:57,510
performance is coming you can always run

00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:00,420
an environment we all flex big

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,140
transaction we can always go to the

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,540
other side and stuff today off we need

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,650
is a unmodified gas but of

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,369
course because at all now we can switch

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,820
to be layoffs are having for later on

00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:20,220
the back can we are environmental

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,729
performance then we can go to a trial

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,290
basis that means that we do use to

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,080
inception but we don't have the

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,409
interview committee we can learn that is

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:37,860
driving which are located we start

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:40,680
practice too if you might sweep aside

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,299
you guys still the trial is preferably

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,369
spark from barrington performance

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:53,299
performance on that because we have a

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:56,280
lot of overhead this is interesting

00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:59,610
function or a physical advice directly

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,189
to be there is another work of light

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,229
into the world in perspective today at

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,670
least it is less these Erastus actually

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:12,090
remove all the overhead of the interest

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,830
so they can fix the machine that they no

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,770
scars and get me x

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:22,260
I possibly to our is actually Elvis

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:25,380
Alton take video okay for work we have

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,830
got a medium performance to do it I owe

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:33,860
me what we still have all that I use our

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:37,110
position of today are a big fellow so

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,810
something that we are ready it was

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,310
written in the previous not district

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,920
officials presentation before that but

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,080
just as a reminder how we saw your work

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,170
today so we have a gas that has it in

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:54,480
her memory I rescue the we hook you

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,260
depending and the gas actually post on

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,209
the i/o request in this rating

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,190
identification to me so sir um you then

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,740
because secure me with recipes request

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,410
we only interact with the physical area

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,600
device at some finished processing the

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,240
request assistance as a notification to

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,560
the gap and that's what is that the

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,300
notification to the gas is actually

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,920
signs of the virtual interrupts of the

00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,200
notification from the gas to be so

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,140
curious actually than the execution of

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,420
privilege distractor the VIPs structure

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,610
now let's try to work or now without

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,730
justification all these certifications

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,410
actually called beginning we have access

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,810
to be a mattress context switch between

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,830
guess more than droid smell between a

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:41,640
guest execution and lee news KVN aqm you

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:45,030
so if we look at okay see you thread

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,570
running on is even or some point yes we

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,580
like to perform such as I operations to

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,760
show the daytime the everyday of you and

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,700
send the notification to the kvm in the

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,970
form of a pio instructional procedure in

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,060
the processor to route one now k we n we

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:06,510
receive the CD with the gas and assuming

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,830
it has another girl for processing in

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:14,070
the i/o we people to use in this curve

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:17,400
of the ice we finish working the agonist

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,870
and point me to notify the gas to notify

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,209
the guess we need to check for joining

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,850
us but today we cannot be checked the

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,160
ritual interest when X is running first

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,110
needs to force an acid substitution of

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,690
the guests we do

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:33,780
sending an IP I so one switch back to

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:37,889
the kvm concepts can become actual

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,780
uniforms with either now we have one

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,730
threat from the limits / I think you

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,370
could cause perspective we have one

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,130
thread 4 HDC view that we run and we

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:50,130
have one or more stress for each

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,560
visualize device when you find one or

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:57,690
more Morris because basically the case

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,669
of snow I want real change them so it's

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:03,300
like understand miss Maud actually

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:06,360
scales in a system we have a good people

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,520
gasp random many many colors and we have

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,760
a lot of Iowa so basically wouldn't have

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,190
called this press tv thread that runs

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,110
all the colors across all the curve and

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,680
we have all these X's context which

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,900
further notification what's going on

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,229
here so basically we are relying on the

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:30,810
Linux host thread by scheduler to decide

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:33,990
where each thread ranks for how long but

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,270
good here because the Linux scheduler

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,760
the call scheduler has no information

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:42,210
about what's going on with the big day

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:46,020
of us right it is not as idea about how

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:50,300
many requests are in each cube for how

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:53,640
was I might be there waiting this is

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,060
kind of a button software scheduler that

00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,220
but you cannot make smart decisions

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,060
because there is kind of semantics back

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,470
it's a mental gasps the threat of

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:11,190
scheduler have no idea about to be read

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:13,350
I have time NBC's that the previous

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,880
mention cause a lot of overhead let's

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:19,590
try to focus also on track so we have

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,050
some time over smoothing or system that

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,020
means we are getting CCS more course for

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,300
supper every year admit we probably runs

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,660
more friction a case in the same server

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,760
we are opening faster network I mean we

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,930
need the list that we need to reflect

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:39,210
more bandwidth at lower latest and not

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,810
going to understand actually that's a

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:45,040
virtualization

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:50,470
pew intense back so we spent a lot of

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:53,980
cycles for processing your request so if

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:56,740
we are spending more cycles and we have

00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:02,830
a single core why actually we should

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:08,620
rely on five mission to rely run will

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:12,550
spread across smooth curve and using it

00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:15,430
in a quick dedication the color for you

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:20,860
want it work only size doesn't have

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:23,050
enough for now that means that either I

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:27,370
go back and consider all these fat

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:30,550
contracts that's why we propose the

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:34,740
original surface based on the idea of

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:38,440
how is that we keep miss peep at me

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,889
random today but we put all them only on

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:46,780
the set of course not all the curves and

00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:49,600
we reserve one or more curves for ID so

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:56,380
the btp threat will be scheduled by the

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:58,690
lib toss in this course but we prefer we

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:05,470
will total for handling all the other

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:08,680
requests we spin actress drive device or

00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:11,320
rattle device to be in the pork we still

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,250
rely on the limits of scalar to decide

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,740
when each stress mr. Rath so to fix this

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:23,620
from an enchanted because model so we

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:27,669
now do it impressed and I for me Rosario

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:30,430
fiercest emeritus I process it before so

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:33,370
if you get really sad because we have

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,219
single girls rest pristine area from

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:41,110
which means we can implement our own our

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:43,630
own ice cream but with this dress this

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,480
red will look monitor the activity of

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:50,440
the fuse and we decide if you need to be

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:55,639
focused for how long any questions so

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:58,170
far so this model absolutely

00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,510
it makes me tell your more efficient

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,459
because we now can versus the cute based

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,850
on the iotv see what's going on in

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:14,910
diffuse we can balance throughput legacy

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:17,100
more efficiently because we sure okay so

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,160
the next to the season the

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,380
implementation what diseases like that

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,170
we have a Rico threat the factually has

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,620
the least of cute that's our kind of

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,480
phone mode so we use all the traditional

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,029
justification for a mechanism for always

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,389
and it seems like that but if you don't

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:38,730
have either so it may not be fury

00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:41,970
utilized but we don't want to render

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,670
every CPS we start doing some Iona's you

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,470
need it before but it will realize it

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,290
when we talking the few slides about the

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,360
policy decide how many curve you need

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,089
practice too you know Gentry's

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,790
dynamically here in relevant but again

00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,740
these models before letter to product

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,510
key respect of the activity valid

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,269
between through the life is amorous to

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,819
you can look into the activity of the

00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,649
cues we reduce lots of fair process and

00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:09,630
threads context switches it's a naval

00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,399
and necessarily commitment we will

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,740
discuss this in the next slide and we

00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,839
can do things like within Islam at least

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,600
specifically but life because see during

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,240
is a vm is running to decide if we

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,510
should process with you or not if the vm

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:28,620
primary much each people process if

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:30,720
you're actually right now okay so how

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,139
will the notification now that we have a

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,680
dedicated dress with the dedicated car

00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,850
personally I of machines with

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,540
notifications anymore from the guest the

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,760
cost we can't all we do like you're an

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,730
open to the ability of use we do I on

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:52,410
into the rift now we still need to stop

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:54,750
the car gasps specifications how to get

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:58,440
the visual interest without smoking an

00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:01,199
exit for that we implemented recall para

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,640
visual interest using Alex posted

00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:05,970
interest for those who are not familiar

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,089
with this feature enables and it's in

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:12,060
room however feature that will be fi

00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:15,300
whistle processor in every score revenue

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,120
from small to share and visual interact

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,990
directly to another score running gasps

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,779
move without requiring an exit that's

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,700
what we need we didn't have a dependent

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,529
in evaluation discard work we

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,850
implemented these three differential

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:36,810
approach so hows it original person

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:39,690
interviewed by Eric explicit Iraq so

00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:46,800
unique statistics insert processors we

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:48,750
do have a reason to deliver all the

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,940
interrupts directly to get close to the

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,330
guests without sporting an exit but

00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:57,240
since on all of national basis it's not

00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:59,550
interrupted all the interest are the

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,310
limits to the gas or all the intervals

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,320
and exit so what we did advantage of

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,060
this feature so we deliver all the

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,399
interest to the guests but we need on

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,709
the internet that are not having to the

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,080
guest to be to cause a nexus and we

00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:15,540
product by diaper visor so we ran the

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,070
guest not with the guest I DTU

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,560
transcripts of seven what we call a

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:24,480
shadow agency that's the shadowy sees

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,790
the ID I provide the right a vm so that

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,910
is a rest of it to be processed fact it

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:33,150
actually the lowest delivered record

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:36,330
without connected to the internet but

00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:38,270
interest is to be perfect that we

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,010
process like heaven and earth believed

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:44,850
they are working on a system of

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:48,110
respecting the how we did that body you

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,660
desire you know of interruption of

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,820
interest and research entities you know

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,980
represents an interim better unfold to

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,260
the corresponding interrupt handler we

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,690
have a Kraken be there so we can tell

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,670
the present with secure that means the

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,790
fixings are up the rice which we call

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:09,120
NASA an assassin not present and this is

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,810
Miss Matthews of trustees this interrupt

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,520
and under them in the host and

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:18,089
interested we like to deliver in the gas

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:21,020
we shall give this recipe and one this

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,020
is not connected

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:30,830
so you know you have super vs so it

00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:34,320
should be a cup on satellite so

00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:37,890
depending on Wheels is running there is

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,650
a little rascal who did we end the

00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:47,250
limiter but it's not agree for next chef

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:50,070
configuration of the IDC and shadow I

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,780
see we have lost identity let's park the

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,400
other side of the IDC that's not

00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:57,270
necessary to this another mechanism

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,760
actually relies on the IDC register it's

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,230
like believe it so all the interesting

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,760
thing to be handled by the costs are

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:07,980
actually a higher vectors so there is no

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,800
screeching the ID CR and there with the

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,960
general protected sectional set design

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,960
traffic Eastern Africa protection

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,230
exceptions there are some advantages

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:24,330
disadvantages using the NP or a GP

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:27,690
approach shots for firemen demonstrate

00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:30,720
the future hardware equal to the reasons

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:34,040
of state we still need to of knowledge

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,820
changer to the interrupt all today

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,610
defendant we have a visa for this week

00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:46,320
of negative after that we can agree

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:49,980
superb let's get resurrected pisser with

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,160
it all laughing we can do that we can't

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,910
do that because we expose the freezing

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,440
last the gas talkin all the e the

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:03,030
register in the same place because we

00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:07,590
can trap access my ossifer perfect but

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:10,710
with ecstatic interface each and it's an

00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,960
erratic registered sexual an MSR so we

00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:16,070
can give up this only to the ego I a

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:20,370
matar and use the MSR business to to

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:24,660
access Ponzi society dividual cheat so

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:26,460
that's how early work we implemented an

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,020
express rack a really nice assignments

00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,370
of interest on physical device and

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,070
delivers ready to the guess but in this

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,470
case we want to improve perimeter so mr.

00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:37,770
paramutual pasta listen

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:40,770
how it worked we have a share filter

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,890
between the hypervisor yet we're apt

00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:46,710
description was visually would like to

00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:49,380
share yeah would you say if you send an

00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,600
FBI from 14 to another color and we

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,390
modify together so when you get this API

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,010
you can see descriptive which correspond

00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,230
with an interregnum that we would like

00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:03,120
to share and call the corresponding data

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:07,260
so that's how I will focus on there now

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:11,250
going back to be fine right wing and why

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:14,850
it's important so it is a discovery

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:18,990
single a colonel tres profiting I oh we

00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:24,710
decided to stop processing part 1 why we

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:28,350
trust all the q's week at all all right

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:32,220
i'm assuming that we know there is some

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:35,010
DVD new items in the other kids don't to

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:38,880
start there even maximum amount of data

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:42,810
for this QB switch views go team ask you

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,990
let's say we display that means for us

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:51,180
means that we have you with pending

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:54,840
items but no more idols were the last

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:58,290
property in other words the fact we are

00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,660
not processing queue it somehow stopping

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:04,230
the work of life is excused from making

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,820
problems like legacy thank you that

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:13,470
means that we like to switch as fast as

00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:15,540
possible to process you probably but we

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:21,030
don't want to switch few too often

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:25,080
because it's also have our own switch

00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:28,830
views on so important your senses will

00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:32,280
look the traditional realize the main

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:35,460
thread scheduler decides life is

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:39,720
therefore how to let you know Colonel

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,520
because rest may be much higher than you

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,490
know the silence is easier that means

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,160
that we can process more views in less

00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,370
time that we have it when compared to

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,650
differential

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,270
now with Elvis money to care about the

00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,030
placement of the threads in memory and

00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,850
interrupt so dramatic performance would

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:05,000
we actually dedicate one corporate music

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:09,540
and that for example during we have

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,900
every year and also cause we like to we

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:16,620
we have liked more back that means we

00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,660
need more court anyway and we also want

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,630
to be looma where that means that we

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:26,160
like take advantage of the charger that

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:30,440
level sessions before we have yea yea

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,840
Korean running sense of it if a catch

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,690
and of course of all also we have a

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,190
cache misses we still are with remote

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,340
controller too many so we don't need

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:44,220
lower processors and you can bring data

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:47,310
from remote a socket and we can also

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,370
take advantage of DDI originality if you

00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,990
are conveniently video from inside

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,900
physically back boosh days and directly

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,880
to the cache of the processor so when he

00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:01,520
uses previous p.m. intersection is a

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:05,400
predator and you process it and we also

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,560
now the path we can also deliver all the

00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,470
interest of the physical valve to

00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,780
discover that means that we should not

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,450
be stopped running gasps because les

00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,670
interesa right to any curve may arise

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:22,400
courses around abuses this week of

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:25,710
practice different localities and also

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:30,270
if we look at multipolar in the driveway

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:33,780
after we have moved leader / q visual

00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:40,370
function or port that means that can be

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:47,910
if i'll answer first 11 I now correct oh

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:49,470
yes food court single oppressor whatever

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:53,250
you prefer just you know a measure of

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:54,690
performance but what evaluate it work

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,040
with the full court we decide will I

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,180
first reading because when you have any

00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:02,180
way to be diverse as you have a lot of

00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:02,180
nice yeah so Anthony yes

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:30,090
today I'm curious you had all the cops

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,820
this regard I would get sued evaluation

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:36,290
in a few sites and let me see let me

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:39,780
know me to be faster disco server not

00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:42,870
afraid of civilization so girls how we

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,790
actually move this recent progress how

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:48,960
we might difficulty me other than us and

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:53,160
we are solicited in clinic again so I

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,650
love nine you have so you are all

00:20:53,160 --> 00:21:00,720
welcome to review the business common

00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:05,610
uses and there is a working progress on

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,650
by yeah maybe a python that in the

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,500
current publish it set a spatula to

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:13,320
publish the existence kind of fixed

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:17,940
partitioner in the resource Colonel

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:20,490
Morgan a parameter where you define a

00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,280
maximum number of regional directors of

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,050
each resource read can handle and we use

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,340
these values as to create more pictures

00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,080
right that's not something that needs to

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,460
be active in a string we are

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,860
implementing production we're

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,980
implementing this effect interface so

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,300
you can on the fly urine ransacked the

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,280
because module that we would like to

00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,220
create more week of threat we would like

00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:45,600
to destroy me sorceress also use the

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:47,850
ccss interface to assign a given Q to a

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,530
specific which was right so you may

00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,540
would like giving right side you may

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,640
want to migrate and giving you for one

00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,929
we saw spread to another week of rest to

00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:01,250
me that one and you have one self more

00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:04,230
perfect aim and we will I also to

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,480
implement a policy framework of monitor

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,270
the activity of assistance and your

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,560
answer to the question that was asked at

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,750
the beginning of the presentation and

00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,370
the University types how many people

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,980
threat I of course like so

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,800
okay and you know destroy it really

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:24,150
stressed based on the eye of 50 di mo

00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,620
does at least okay so basically what we

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,260
like to do this as your support the

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,500
first star power by asking share because

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,090
stress model just a patch that enables

00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,670
the Vico threat to handle will diffuse

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,130
moves like otherwise then the copper

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:40,110
mechanics in the sea surface we can

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:44,670
allocate your real ID we spread on the

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:47,520
flash it does one the first are we start

00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,440
with the default of 1130 devices means

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,200
us because we continue to run as it runs

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,059
today exactly the same model but we

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,550
choose that means if someone would like

00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,970
to reduce the number of piece of thread

00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:03,870
we have the control interface for that a

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:06,750
d-stick so do so we can get both bills

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,309
that your communities progress alone so

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,260
we use of space applications that

00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:14,040
monitor these statistics and decide how

00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:17,160
many people are submitted and voting

00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,929
optimization so we don't need that is

00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,150
anymore you just fall for the visa your

00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:26,600
keys and the body's mechanisms to

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:30,530
perpetuate the users are your 30 yeah

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:34,170
I'm too important power carry it into

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:36,000
because for most of empower processor we

00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,580
would have more Hardware threads per

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,040
core thats related to the hydrostatic

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,690
model imogen we have only chisel it's

00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,540
not a big deal but with our would have

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,910
much more than two more than isn't too

00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,130
hard or threads per core that means that

00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:54,059
if we take advantage of that we may run

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:56,790
multiple visuals a thread on the same

00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:59,400
curve in multiple harbor threats and now

00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:01,950
they let the hard work getting between

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:07,679
these threats suppose of trying to do

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:09,450
this software and now letzte to and

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,450
performance evaluation implemented these

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:15,750
on top of kvm the random valuation of

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:19,470
3.1 tune 0.4 thing but the latest code

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,150
is for Colonel 3.9 and thank you

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:26,610
everyone for 3 and the results are

00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:27,950
similar and for using visas and and we

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,529
used le we

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,059
use le to improve as rivalry performance

00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:33,769
because we compared to ask i really

00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:35,269
wanted to prefer to these types of the

00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:38,179
artists i realized i get we work we

00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:39,529
don't have overcome validity we also to

00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:43,070
implement the provincial posture

00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:45,470
interest and we use sundries machines

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:48,649
with a dual socket experts el qez

00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:52,460
processor array of unique from intel

00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:54,350
well for potential of each each for and

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,970
we to identify servers direction

00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,970
connector one was running the original

00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:04,820
now we compared with one of the

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,130
important issues of spells into

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:10,580
scalability so run all the management 15

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:13,909
from 1 to 14 single processor which one

00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:17,149
escape system scan and depending on the

00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:20,260
business practice in one or two and she

00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:21,919
gave it forward I we are Elvis

00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:26,570
administration's what we all know

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:30,220
interposition but I really so just

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:32,899
impossible to a visual machine because

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,639
overhead but we don't have only a leader

00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:37,100
pacifica communities that we work on

00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:39,799
just be sure how efficient as we see

00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,990
also we are too deep but if I from the

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,279
more efficient air and we compare a

00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:50,000
little eyes to different spatial

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:52,549
configuration so we ran a again from 1

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,649
to 14 virtual machines when we ran up to

00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:57,139
7 video machines we dedicated worker

00:25:54,649 --> 00:26:00,919
because we were running I scored socket

00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:02,299
want to dedicate one surface with 17

00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,500
winter machine please choose course

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:08,570
pariah in the case of values we

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,070
dedicated to maximize the performance of

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:13,639
its own machines we dedicated the core

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:15,380
for HP cpu and we use one or two is the

00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:17,539
number of you two machines in the case

00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,639
of it will be exactly the same amount of

00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:21,260
course I will let you learn Linux

00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:23,889
scheduler decide where all the

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,950
recipients are vicious right track in

00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:30,679
Cynthiana Cobb we answer your question

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:33,080
Anthony but since it's not we call the

00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,019
visual threats that it in them to the I

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,750
occur so we rely on the lingual

00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:42,120
scheduler and we think of Lisa

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:45,400
viewthread surface of course

00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,789
right but we enable Pauline this model

00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:52,289
in world because we could practice all

00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:58,900
the time we run and we start each other

00:26:52,289 --> 00:27:00,520
dowling they release the core faster no

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,779
I don't have that data but I remember

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:07,360
from the disparity know that we patrol

00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:09,850
in what we saw this exactly I mean it's

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,799
appalling with multiple threads in this

00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,870
line for the system will not perform

00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:15,700
well because again if you are consuming

00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:20,890
see you like this all the time even when

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:23,679
you are doing nothing so the initial get

00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,779
very aggressive as far as ppc64 my

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,510
excitement you can see that that we

00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:31,690
sustain much better that the basement

00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:34,120
because net and the back of the screen

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,340
he also and we were even better in

00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,730
Australia with you are probably asking

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:43,210
yourself wife according to understand

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:45,760
here in particular you are using more

00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:47,830
call dedicated forever that's not for

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,460
decades of service but the reason that

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:53,230
we perform better than ve yes I review

00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,090
was related to interact relaxing that

00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,580
again is it was a mission before that we

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:02,200
were using for a service of machines

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:05,500
don't work I'm going to third 0 2 4 with

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:09,100
more services and last why we were very

00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,140
honest really that's because we collect

00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,370
and interact more eclectic we win

00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:17,950
because Natalie in the Israel week a

00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:20,409
function was rising around dangerous

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,570
profession all the time but with Elvis

00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:24,940
depending on the number of machines we

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,860
were right in between for case we let us

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,289
get into a super cycle and we start

00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,909
adding more and more recently we start

00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:32,409
collecting more more aggressively and

00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,210
the number of interest with an

00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:36,760
interactive were connected to the visual

00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:40,360
machine it reduces number of

00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:43,000
presumptions increases and we also be

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,850
sure and legacies in the network

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,830
yudhishtira because see here also that

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:51,850
we were much better than the baseline

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:54,549
and again we were rich mercenary but

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,290
related to discover we notice that fast

00:28:54,549 --> 00:29:00,900
track

00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:06,690
even a Lexus increaser 20 milliseconds

00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:09,450
safe and without it we will not enable a

00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:13,980
struggle in the neck because we would be

00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:15,720
stopped work and now of course we also

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,720
come up guys get that elusive not

00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,270
perform close to us right away that's

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,720
what I became saturate it was the case

00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:27,180
of Memphis t for example that after we

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,060
kiss for me and of course in distress

00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,530
was not it was saturated it was not able

00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,050
to process the IO coming from the rest

00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:37,350
of the virtual machine that's why you

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:39,390
see that after seven visual machines we

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,030
added another I'd occur to continue

00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:45,450
scale that's important our core the pony

00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:48,330
that we need a cliche the f650

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,430
repetition of the system but the policy

00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,950
at this point we should be assessed we

00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:56,030
need another score correct out of eight

00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:58,980
we mainly focuses on the coast of course

00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:05,010
we're running it appears so we will def

00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:08,130
gotta run you see rightfully and look at

00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:10,650
this dress is what which one we also ran

00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:15,890
because flock of a string we just love

00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:19,710
the best after scare with that in a it's

00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:23,490
your ambition is to simulate very fast I

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:25,350
device is not really sinagra and you can

00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,600
see care much whether later later see

00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,460
but we also came back different

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,220
configuration using fusion-io device

00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:36,600
previous lectures and this is what we do

00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:38,610
not see a menu or Colonel York you

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,510
review and the resource blocks

00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:44,850
bartenders not after the service so

00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,760
computing for instance our political

00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:50,070
system with faster network and we need a

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,330
more efficient and more scale every sale

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:53,670
for that and that's what we are

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,890
proposing with Elvis and the future work

00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:59,280
we are working on the policy mechanism

00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:00,990
and the control mechanism damage so we

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,750
are running out of time website open to

00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:07,710
questions sure

00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,710
