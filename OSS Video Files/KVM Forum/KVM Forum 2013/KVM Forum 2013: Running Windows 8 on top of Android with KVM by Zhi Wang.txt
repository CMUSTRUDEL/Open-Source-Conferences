We have been able to run a Windows 8 guest efficiently (including virtio drivers) on top of an x86 Android tablet with KVM, and we believe that KVM play the key role on such mobile devices. As mobile devices become more popular and the hardware technologies advance, virtualization on such mobile devices becomes more important. With KVM, we can enable H/W-based virtualization simply and efficiently on such small devices, taking advantage of the Linux-based system, including Android. At the same time, we found various challenges especially with qemu mainly because of the differences in 1) the user level infrastructure, such as libraries, the graphics system, and system calls, 2) scheduling (e.g. foreground apps are suspended). We discuss those challenges and our solutions, and the next steps, such as, sensor support, Connected Standby for Windows 8.

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:21,780
to via the talk about of the Pope for

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:26,159
the path the talk about the would have

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,170

duration feature has been on enabled it

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:58,469
on many of us s even on them for example

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:03,060
for the entire processor so on HGTV of

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:06,920
it I give me available even via a

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,390
modified under the organization you know

00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,690
University Prime Minister in relation

HPA is a very popular mobile or is as

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,940
you know an element more than turns for

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,250
standard for overall mobile device

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,820
includes the cell phone tablet naturally

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,520
are on in one Joris in current market

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,430
past year so you can see that is there

00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,180
that they are in huge amount of for

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:55,060
device running enjoy so that is so we

00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:00,160
have cheated we do we cannot even not

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,960
enjoy enjoy here i should enjoy it's a

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,860
little better actually the first the

00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,390
color is enjoy either colonel father it

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,180
troubling news my is a very different

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:13,530
one from the achieve containers for

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,810
example windows of for example dear

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:20,770
Libra see for the and Roy actually it's

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,930
a it's a bionic University on it sir it

00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,900
has a license of a part thought

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:30,070
therefore for example for for Ubuntu

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:33,580
read ahead and other traditional you

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:36,459
know distributions of using a Geneva see

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:39,160
this is a really different actually of

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,709
Ionia is a very small barracks bio next

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,190
University diversity is very small and

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:49,810
they cannot provide and just provided

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:55,000
the functionality useful useful children

00:03:49,810 --> 00:04:00,790
mobile OS Sofia yeah even either cannot

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,150
support a 64-bit yeah and but we notice

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,910
that the Android kernel is yeah enjoy

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,400
Connor is an inner corner so so that

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,290
gave us opportunity to use the QB n

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:18,609
because Keira means and encounter face

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:20,260
yeah so so all so what what Alan how to

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:24,729
enable cable enjoy

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:27,070
actually a you can use a cure to any in

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:32,290
supported or OS over

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:36,100
in certain as I enjoy or even even you

00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:39,280
are an evil windows so you know July we

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:44,230
just use a chart using event rebound a

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,800
you have indicated to a x86 Android you

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:52,270
guys 7-8 is a unique feature is only

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:58,600
able to ROI a processor you cannot run

00:04:52,270 --> 00:05:02,260
on vomited i'm windows party it's not a

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,510
window say so this why we are we live it

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,330
work that is our motivation to use a key

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,470
vm to enable windows ways for our I

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:14,250
enjoy

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:17,890
yeah that's our motivation okay

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,920
actually before we talk about it how we

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,500
enable the windows a against nature talk

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,170
about there the mode of Windows bathed

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,960
guest actually windows air gets a higher

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:36,190
highs achieve two modes one mozi is

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:39,850
so-called legacy story is across the

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:44,140
legacy piece mode on negative Samaritan

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:46,660
I mean for example Alexei PC

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,710
devices such as mouse keyboard megawatt

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:54,760
addy etc those to do that those devices

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,560
are very commonly in the PC is a PC but

00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,790
it's not coming in their packet and a

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,500
cell phone yes it's in other years a PC

00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,110
bounce

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,200
it's an XP spouse and the ODN can be

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,530
disabled but for the task is that each

00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,900
much more complicated complicated

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,990
for example our tablet were used so many

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:22,060
modern have many different different

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:24,790
advises of the frontier traditional PC

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:29,350
for template Archie a census secrete a

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:32,280
boot yeah the two devices rate of the -

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:36,550
it must have on their mobile devices and

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,460
in other if the tablet is Julia fine not

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,410
about nor the xbox live difference in

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,200
the

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:46,950
even for this for windows for the window

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,830
see a it is easy if you require to

00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:53,370
support I can I stand by that means when

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:56,150
the windows aid end of this number it

00:06:53,370 --> 00:07:01,590
still okay to save their life walk event

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:06,870
it is still able to get a receive the

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:10,800
email or received a a message for

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:15,150
example HR or even she talked yeah

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,420
such a Sanskrit of events but so but by

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,490
trivial in in this Kelsey we are we just

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,470
began with the biggest piece they could

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,660
biggest piece about the week Madhu means

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:29,670
that the parent who Kim gbemi you

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,910
filming you about many supporters there

00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:35,310
PC PC mode another friendly to the

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,400
tablet mode so you fluent you even

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,200
choose to call it the tablet but we we

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,740
still have a not what reduce example we

00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:47,700
needed to even if the touch touch RT

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:49,230
device since it was and yeah you only

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:55,110
need to choose to pour the water you

00:07:49,230 --> 00:08:00,960
file so in this case with each other we

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,800
just use listener okay let's go for a

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,400
pro tab

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,370
aha we have a for a different asset it's

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:13,080
the one of the password what preference

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:17,070
the key to do this pod to do this

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,260
project this meaning in other user name

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:23,550
is a nimble and joy actually nimble

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:29,700
enjoy is either qme you are based a big

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:34,229
best solution for Android yep banter

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,539
with that is thing I will talk about the

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:38,870
modification what what what water comes

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:42,270
down what what what have done to do that

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:48,680
performs and the nimble enjoy and make

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:49,990
that the network on our persons yeah

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,720
okay

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,360
that is enjoy preference actually that

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,250
is suppose we have a to preference in

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,620
this whole yeah one is a core base

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:04,810
tablet that is a Intel I have a bridge

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:08,140
call at IFI always a 4G memory and walk

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,780
and Riaan Kenji a to give your SSD that

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,820
is actually that is a letter there is a

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:16,260
core base that habit know that item

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:21,000
second is ID on a tree that is a facial

00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:25,030
typically the page for at home with a

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:34,690
razor to bigger memory and the 128 gig

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:37,120
immensely okay okay for let me introduce

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,100
a nimble what is a nimble nimble

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,560
actually nimble is over thought project

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,690
based on the cue in the unit which you

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,770
can't manage what you were commissioned

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:50,290
and armor Android actually listen you

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:54,690
know just for us is our mat enjoy and

00:09:50,290 --> 00:10:00,450
reasons that I don't base that watches

00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:05,970
are very often the most sure um I

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:09,130
visited and Anjali devices another

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:13,110
another support my current elitsa we are

00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:17,110
what it entails 20 should you catch up

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:20,130
that is because of that the new model is

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:24,090
just is adjustable too long or almond

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:28,120
Android devices okay

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:30,280
that is the Chi so you can see that is

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,190
there is a tribute here actually that is

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:36,100
that is offer sort of our happiness of

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:38,260
the world keyboard on the screen but

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,960
this one this is secreting there is

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:46,740
Melinda let it render it these are

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:49,020
easily beautiful wonders yeah we can use

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:54,370
enjoy software software keyboard

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:57,940
re-imported dream to input KRG but to

00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:00,040
you phylidia be at a certain the the

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,750
calculators to their freedom that is

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:10,270
what application in the windows the

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:13,030
yeah and so what what what we needed to

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:17,190
do is actually we first we need to put

00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:19,270
it in Bonjour to you I a that is XA d

actually that is not an arm or a

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:49,650
specific that is Jenna Jenna epic egg

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:52,420
one for Ian in this limbo you know

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:56,650
therefore as we are three active case

00:11:52,420 --> 00:12:00,400

anytime just by activity its active in

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:30,550
in assistance when for example edit land

00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:33,130
reform okay you can see that it's a

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,890
banner that is you can use the designer

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,140
to make the phone call and that is a

00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,960
tree that is that actually that is so

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,390
called activity we appraisal this one

00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,570
together this phone dress that is free

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:50,650
to another activity anytime just the

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:54,160
only only one activity is act Pizza

00:12:50,650 --> 00:13:02,440
available in is active in Android system

00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:05,140
so um here we are 3-3 activity here any

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:09,070
meaningful activity will be launched it

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:11,320
is all they are the user to configure to

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:16,260
configure your nimble

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:22,430
such as the the program

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:28,490
of their of the qu academia entered in

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:32,730
and then use the issued command with the

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:36,120
new king I actually and activity is a

00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:39,810
rhythm is written by Java code so you do

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:45,810
we use that user interface to call the

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:50,370
PIO qu mu G 1 G 2 created here to kill

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:54,360
me you to and to kill Kimmy you you

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:59,280
processor and the in the run of the

00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:03,270
Windows 8 yeah to run an 8-minute a and

00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:06,930
they after that reverse to eat Cheerios

00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:10,860
SDL activity or VNC activity possibly

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:15,300
actually as the GUI you're not in order

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:21,560
the user and at UC are to to operate it

00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,560
yes here the windows to to Windows 8

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:33,020
it's given we will see are using are

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,720
using the surface

00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:41,640
g60 a go6 view to created the earth

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:47,670
there's civility to success cross

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:52,700
zippers so that the window well as a GUI

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:58,760
can show in the either SEL your VNC

00:14:52,700 --> 00:15:02,550
ok part in France they are point of view

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,040
forefront the up q qm you

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:08,010
front of you they are several different

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,100
process here where is a few mu another

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:14,370
that is running in the background to

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:19,890
children to to run the windows a the SDL

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:21,750
in each a SDL this disability at example

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,810
we and she has a same story

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,900
this deer activity value in that is

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,699
another approach it is another processor

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:34,799
or you know it

00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:38,279
a unit kanata tude you connected to the

00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:47,730
windows aid and the shield windows data

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:48,720
GUI okay there is a front walk of the

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,089
Invo enjoy

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:56,189
okay let's talk about in more details

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:58,709
the display area today we have another

00:15:56,189 --> 00:16:02,069
target I talked about so called a VGA a

00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:10,919
salmon or other of our phase modulation

00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:17,899
but here in you know display yeah

00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:21,239
HDL will use will use traditional

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:25,379
Android G of gl6 view to create the

00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:28,499
ticket so and eventually that it will be

00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:32,040
that there to create a native window

00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:34,709
using the ggl api after that get at the

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,619
window and a different buffer in the via

00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:39,929
the 50 L that we can operate a better

00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:43,139
frame buffer achieved for example to you

00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:47,819
to teach you or reduce your goal or

00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:51,449
display the content of from windows side

00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:53,779
yeah that is at Felicity square for the

00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:58,470
input you for the year you the one to of

00:16:53,779 --> 00:17:01,649
actually offer it via the windows for

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:05,039
example you want you put something in

00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:09,329
the world what application then the user

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:12,630
he'll need a little input access but an

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:16,439
actuarial you cannot we do need to pass

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:20,480
through or watching eyes the input for

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:24,089
example keyboard and will enjoy they are

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:28,139
virtual watch your screen watch box we

00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:30,720
watch your keyboard will be used and if

00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:34,669
the activity work for the user activity

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:38,549
improved for in the user activity to do

00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:40,529
to the sto Andrew library so the SDL a

00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:43,440
library will forwarded this input for

00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:48,090
example the a coordination or pressure

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:51,060
of the input queue to the background to

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:55,350
to the to the to the to the windows side

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:58,620
yes you can decide that is the input

00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:01,440
another is a son if their windows want

00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,980
to play the song for example to freedom

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:11,880
Odin pray flip ever played would do

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:15,060
audio the invisible we also needed to to

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:19,200
provide this capability in this solution

00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:22,620
actually we do between we doing to

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,380
enable we do not have to unit via would

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:29,010
sound virtualization this data we just

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:32,430
created a audio straight and use the

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:34,380
Android on audio or the track from the

00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:38,820
audio finger for different needs and joy

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:42,510
is on your audio service um once the

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:47,100
crew was the audio track is created by

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:52,050
by the author finger and the in the HDL

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:54,720
can play the music from there for the

00:18:52,050 --> 00:19:05,250
windows to the elite you to the edge of

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:08,130
audio device yeah okay um that is a that

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,350
is about modification we have done first

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,370
of it for the kernel actually we do need

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,780
to do anything

00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:17,940
Colonel can support KVM natively and we

00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,190
just need that you enable qmz call in

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,650
the kernel configuration but follow

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:26,910
powering the only key is as I mentioned

00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:31,650
the Enya Omega is small the library is

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:33,210
not it's not a genie to see so it is

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,540
even if they in order the different

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:41,460
courses for example for example those

00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:48,540
respect for video API prism 58-54 cue

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:51,270
item 64 l6l 664 we needed to edit out of

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:54,690
this system course back to the Bionic

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,760
yeah and the we also needed to run

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,360
another protocol function that is a

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,570
secret

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:04,170
and the weight the which is required

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,720
about a buttock area as well yeah for

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:11,400
the nimble I enjoy so nimble enjoy here

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:14,190
as care is original Nouveau enjoy just a

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:18,420
feature on our system so we needed to

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,790
support the new modular to over 80 x86

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,030
firstly we needed to solve the building

00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:28,950
issue on the ethics 86 in the Dean we

00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:34,140
need we need a high pass pass the enable

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:38,130
cave and a parameter to the to the Q&U

00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,940
yes including included word height or

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:46,070
concretions

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:49,290
yeah after that week we can run there

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:56,180
the windows on top of our enjoy using

00:20:49,290 --> 00:21:01,050
hidden exactly 30 the current spirit

00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:05,640
first 32-bit additional windows hue it

00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:10,710
can can work very well on our core or

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:13,350
tablet on water I always used it for the

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,730
network and storage for this place we

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:21,960
are using SDO and a VNC for the Sun on

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:25,560
the user we use the SD activities and

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:30,330
enjoy audio fingers for the for the

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:33,150
input we really actual tablet doesn't

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:37,200
have a keyboard so we need we just

00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:39,480
passed past the Android activity sorry

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,430
we just passed the keyboard mouse or

00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:46,320
touch you in front for Android activity

00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:52,320
to the creamy part but across the you

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:54,780
just another user to to to to input to

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,660
choose free circuit board together the

00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,300
calculate from the keyboard but when the

00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:03,540
user want to do the handwriting to

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:06,180
example you want to use finger to read

00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:09,940
something here has some performance

00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:13,060
issues okay

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:16,540
and we also enable the RTG that is the

00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:21,730
Windows Windows protocol in their remote

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:26,350
to the remote desktop from sharing

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:29,260
sharing model currently you can use the

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:32,380
RDP to doodle to enable the remote high

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:35,230
V P that can another are the user to see

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:41,200
the application windows application in

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:44,400
only on their own on top or do enjoy

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:49,180
screen without the see in the a desktop

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:51,550
your Windows desktop you can you can

00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:56,560
enable the gestures such as a scrolling

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:59,170
game or super cable under Vee you can

00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,940
also enable the observer keyboard order

00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,640
or auto activity

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,010
activation that means serene users are

00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,870
launched the window fabrication program

00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:16,020
to the water in the windows side will

00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:19,030
were launched via a software keyboard

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,950
automatically and they not use the

00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:26,590
treeview servant or enjoy keyboard to

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:28,900
input something yeah let yeah similar to

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,060
you I just I said it just now is a lot

00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:34,570
you know up to still applications only

00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:38,080
without between the whole windows disk

00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:40,960
this hop on yeah just as each rook

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,700
saddle that applications is the Android

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,870
application or the Windows application

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:51,300
yeah it under view you can also enable

00:23:46,870 --> 00:24:00,210
of your warning and check order okay

00:23:51,300 --> 00:24:00,210
all this is a demo in the show here

00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:12,409
yeah we are trying to launch our windows

00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:14,919
user nimble yeah you can see that at

00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:18,009
least this is physician bar which is

00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:21,619
actually the one I enjoy on your staff

00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:25,249
bottle from here that is a just a small

00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:33,769
window on to dispraise of the other

00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:43,399
windows side yeah okay there is a

00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:56,149
Windows tip theta it is ie 2 or to take

00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:58,279
you to the web browser actually you can

00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:02,389
see that the performance is not so good

00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:08,960
in fact to you you move the earth if

00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:12,440
it's not a bit this lower okay we are

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:16,249
trying to launch it away well when the

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:18,859
Beaufort's yeah that is the so-called

00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:21,169
Android software keyboard you know the

00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:41,179
user too young for something to their

00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:49,129
Windows applications yeah okay another

00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:59,529
one right yeah okay okay yeah you don't

00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:59,529
yeah okay yeah let then why you stopped

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,200
okay so this our next step first day we

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,179
needed to enable one to enable the 3d 3d

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,100
acceleration but actually really got

00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:17,880
some problem here for example for the

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:21,299
windows a removal VGA support is no

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,880
longer existent on even for the qu x of

00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:28,320
QX l Joey is not available for others

00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,120
data as well that is so so it that is a

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,940
challenge for us because we cannot a

00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:39,450
leverage on existing video VJ okay qgh

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:42,179
ever for Windows you are you want to do

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:47,090
something I enabled to do office we have

00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:49,850
QT well for our openness side to ever so

00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:51,780
that is a little bit challenging first

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,500
they're going to be no once you enable

00:26:51,780 --> 00:27:00,120
the tablet mode by the way as I said now

00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:01,950
Academy just enable the next PC mode so

00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,020
everything almost everything is

00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:08,720
virtualized for example the our keyboard

00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:13,289
for the sound yeah even for they are

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:17,730
known for their power profits yeah but

00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:19,350
you want you want to enable the hybrid

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,330
mode ability you have adjusted for the

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:25,020
virtual year for administer Muni

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:27,780
determine but for example we are some of

00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,590
Java EE will be prioritized so we can

00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:36,150
either use legacy or Lake you or you fi

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:40,799
directly we need to redefine the DHCP I

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:47,570
table turn on to reflect to reflect

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:47,570
their TV TV devices yeah in other senses

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:53,220
but for the cam camera used to be video

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:57,030
class revelation you know community is

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,950
also very challenged and in other

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:01,500
interviews you use experience the

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:05,460
improvement and just in the demo you can

00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:07,919
see that of India user to to drag to

00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,559
drive the application it's a little bit

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,169
of snow but it's not actually it's not a

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,330
it's not a cost apart which are later

00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:20,149
bar by windows

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:24,239
so is crossed by a path through path

00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:27,749
path path there even in for the vendor

00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:29,460
for Android siren beside yeah so you for

00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,809
want to improve the views you experience

00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,289
improvement of you have you found an

00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:36,629
other way yes instead of a forward

00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:39,059
instead of forwarding they are inquiry

00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:42,409
you went to front on Jewish cider to the

00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:42,409
windows side yeah

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,049
in you know you needed to support water

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,519
clematis Tampa connect somebody's a

00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:53,009
monster high with requirement for the

00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,720
window for the windows usually you fo um

00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:57,330
and once you get a certification program

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,190
for our Mac software either in masters

00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,789
Department can have some by that means

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:05,869
window winders in the standby Windows is

00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:09,210
still able to receive receive their

00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:14,100
receive the email and that other network

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:16,619
went yeah oh you want you but you want

00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,499
to support that is that another good how

00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:22,019
to use hard will reduce to a CPI that

00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:25,259
means the windows side is running on or

00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:27,840
on there on the foreground but Android

00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:30,239
is still running in the background so we

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,259
cannot afford it the hardware into their

00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:38,700
standby any so recorder that we just we

00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:41,850
just give the flake stand by mode to

00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,460
tell the Windows Windows to you to ask

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,519
us to commit to each other windows hey

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:50,489
we are in there a connect Empire on

00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:53,070
actually the hard way still at you yeah

00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:57,179
in this way your background when the

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:59,489
background enjoy is okay can act you

00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,009
otherwise the two windows that they

00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:04,769
enjoy background OS is a progress

00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:08,669
prodigy or in order to do that allow to

00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:11,940
use the hard way to do 16 yeah that

00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:15,590
means the windows were not quoted there

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:21,679
the hardware into L low-power state

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:28,759
using using a space CPI can divinity

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:28,759
yeah that's it any questions yeah

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:52,490
yeah company unique demo in but that is

00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:55,220
a VGA I guess yes then AJ yes I have

00:30:52,490 --> 00:31:00,170
done we have done but I don't have a bit

00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:02,000
here at Rio we just run a benchmark for

00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:05,360
the office yeah

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,460
Co so called asset bench yeah yeah for

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,770
their own the core actually we have a

00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,440
tooth performs one is a corporate press

00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:15,560
or in other is a patrol yeah

00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,860
only call quite funny it's a this waiver

00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:21,770
yeah but for please go to this benchmark

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:24,470
just you quite a 2d your body for

00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:26,780
runners benchmark which require the 3d

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:49,130
tell about the problem because we don't

00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:55,400
support 3d acceleration yeah yeah oh you

00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:59,060
yeah i trial in this demo we are using

00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:03,080
the image you windows image on which is

00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:06,530
story in the human see car and in the

00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:09,320
future we could use the use of watch

00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:11,870
analyze the emergency partition a fine

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,910
if you went to the side so in this way

00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:19,940
we can go to the we can get a better

00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:24,260
performance for there for the input

00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:26,570
actually for the elaborate and a cell

00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,670
phone use parents is very important for

00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:31,910
example and with the user to use the

00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:34,510
finger to touch the screen to operate a

00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:37,460
deal the application the touchy

00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:42,220
performances is very important you have

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,750
auto we consider we can see in a demo on

00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:52,600
actually performance is not so good

00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:56,830
improved yeah yeah in the network

00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:59,769
actually we just use a traditional let

00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:02,740
walk is on baseball on the bridge but

00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:06,039
the in the future you could we could do

00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:10,600
the Wi-Fi which is Asian but the what is

00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:12,820
the challenge yeah so so so that the

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,940
user can get there

00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,990
almost home of the saying use experience

00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:23,080
at the label

00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:29,789
I have wonders yeah or any other

00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:29,789
