We have been able to run a Windows 8 guest efficiently (including virtio drivers) on top of an x86 Android tablet with KVM, and we believe that KVM play the key role on such mobile devices. As mobile devices become more popular and the hardware technologies advance, virtualization on such mobile devices becomes more important. With KVM, we can enable H/W-based virtualization simply and efficiently on such small devices, taking advantage of the Linux-based system, including Android. At the same time, we found various challenges especially with qemu mainly because of the differences in 1) the user level infrastructure, such as libraries, the graphics system, and system calls, 2) scheduling (e.g. foreground apps are suspended). We discuss those challenges and our solutions, and the next steps, such as, sensor support, Connected Standby for Windows 8.
