Block level deduplication is a form of compression eliminating redundancy at the block level. The main goal of it is to save storage space. It's an underdeveloped feature in the Linux and KVM ecosystem. In this presentation BenoÃ®t Canet will talk about the ongoing effort to add SSD based block level deduplication to the QCOW2 image format, what are the technicals challenges and how cloud providers could benefit from it.
