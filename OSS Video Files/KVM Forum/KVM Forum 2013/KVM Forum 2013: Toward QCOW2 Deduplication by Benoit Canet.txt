Block level deduplication is a form of compression eliminating redundancy at the block level. The main goal of it is to save storage space. It's an underdeveloped feature in the Linux and KVM ecosystem. In this presentation BenoÃ®t Canet will talk about the ongoing effort to add SSD based block level deduplication to the QCOW2 image format, what are the technicals challenges and how cloud providers could benefit from it.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
kitchen which it became difficult so

00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,099
yesterday I thought to give in the one

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,980
of the black metal of that the

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:20,880
application was Connor case is true true

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:23,490
relation 20 years san diego you when you

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,720
wanted to do the traditional you need

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:31,439
the extensive aware and the same if you

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:39,120
want to do the education right nope you

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:42,030
need something with an attack so the to

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,550
make it community after that we'll start

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:52,050
to use it so what's the occasion when it

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:54,000
was very suspect so to say space in the

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,180
litigation has to do is to factor rather

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,050
rather than blood so to not hire a

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,899
logical blocks and right values destruct

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:13,619
only one time and then amazement of is

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:17,100
blocks the sim eject a CD because first

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,590
until a road through the duplications

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:24,030
work because they are fast and implicit

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:27,630
and needed to guess and also as we are

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:34,369
the most expensive so saving this base

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,369
maybe various five will make LCD cheaper

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,500
some possible case the first one is a

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,049
with in fact our there are already

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,220
people want to read faster or in the

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:53,939
cloud using to me i know one of them and

00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,850
there are various body there are sooo

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:04,140
some free software on like your catcher

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:09,000
which is a 3d the way so failure waster

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,590
got on his face so if you you can add a

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,930
below the surface

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:19,329
the scale would be to avert using

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:23,469
aliases with your AdvoCare containers or

00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:26,930
ality because the RFS is out of three

00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:29,900
the mood life the yet introduced for the

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,840
guest is fulfilling the duplication

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:37,819
which side the guests transparent of the

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,549
gate under open my image is that we

00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:45,099
successful combiner identification with

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:49,099
compression the user concept to make

00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:52,280
huge equal to volume where the right

00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:57,379
order first and then it would be

00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:02,090
compressed and educated and then this

00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:12,049
volume to dip switch way legend station

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:17,709
a sativa so the first one year ago will

00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:21,799
deviations to go to is that I found that

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:27,709
the kilghard was employed until an

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:33,349
alcove is the prelude breath from our

00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:37,819
nationís rule itself America here unless

00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:41,629
oku as the facility when well since the

00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:48,709
flavor and illogical to physical blood

00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:54,439
money and incomplete education and the

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:57,650
last thing is that if specification go

00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:03,430
to me we've done such verification a

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:05,780
good over NFS raster graphics and

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:14,259
rehabilitation in the line canal of the

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:20,120
trailer doesn't allowed to do that so

00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:23,330
what he does it work and dr. edges are

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:30,639
organizing two blocks a socialist

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:35,870
sir so the reason that he has to do to

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:45,860
make it a logical logical block into the

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:49,939
same physical blood and the earth so

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,909
let's go education would watch for

00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:56,270
example on the lateral with the

00:04:52,909 --> 00:05:01,159
duplication so we have each physical

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:05,330
blood in the red flag went in to

00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:08,629
physical blocks and right and we can see

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:11,990
that in the sweet visible blood with

00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:16,370
blue one I don't call so they

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:22,930
accommodate for the duplication to real

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:25,550
blood is so good the GPS them also if

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:32,000
the same volume was running with

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:38,360
dedication activated if rog district and

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:42,379
interested in the center block and the

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,930
tool is too logical blocks are pointing

00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:57,440
to the green physical block so on a

00:05:44,930 --> 00:06:00,560
simple example the stage rd space so my

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:05,479
sister on yahoo escamilla make them you

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:12,650
take medication worker while rocky path

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:14,659
to a totinos treatment equipment so when

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,849
they are less swim meet later at the

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:21,740
prototype and one year later and send

00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:24,860
message so the prototype values the

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:32,139
strong cryptographic ashes to identify

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:35,360
are identical blood so it's the shg and

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,720
to add a very low probability of

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,110
collision

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,000
for example to confuse the collision

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,200
probability on wanelo by swiss

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,440
quarterback russell you have around this

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,930
probability for a collision I don't know

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:58,680
to read it in English but if you're very

00:06:51,930 --> 00:07:01,860
low here you are something talking about

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:07,980
the biscuit with non ECC ram and it's

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:13,080
much bigger so to mental processes to

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:23,480
write I decided to use an interim trick

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:31,080
to make us work III and also a she and

00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:35,490
there are associated the typical and is

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:41,310
to give a pretty good reduced to because

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:43,740
the king well the data and when good

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,680
thing is that the right path is not

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,250
modified at all so when you read it go

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:55,410
the full speed for the record I also say

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:58,950
that these forces are already went with

00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:03,380
that so close until the beach and the

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:06,330
rest maybe because 100 my very first one

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:10,979
so all the right path from is not very

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:19,860
best II just a prototype we may be with

00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:23,160
the audit education works so when go

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:26,580
through we see the right from the guest

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:29,640
in fact he the receiver right I 0 vector

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,610
this is the right area vector and this

00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,280
rail tell Victor is a composed of

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:40,650
cluster or data block here you have the

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:43,140
data blocks and the only thing that the

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:46,610
Duke sessions to do is to work through

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,649
the right to a store this way and

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,259
confused rush of the first block

00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:55,619
so if we look at into the inner ng3 if

00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:57,899
you know this earth and if you notice a

00:08:55,619 --> 00:09:02,339
 with the difficulties by modifying

00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:04,610
the logical to physical mapping yet next

00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:08,699
to do the same for the second block and

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:11,429
for the swinger block the the under BTW

00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:15,329
cases so if we go and choose his blood

00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:18,509
and then gather the three men tpke blood

00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:22,410
into right sir by a vector and write it

00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:27,660
to this at all so we avoided to apply

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:30,779
the IO and also this right so x 0 vector

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,079
is welcome to disc the disc ashes are

00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:38,040
always welcome to disc and inserted into

00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:42,629
the g3 it does the same for this one and

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:46,860
this one so the duplication cause is not

00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:48,779
very complex right and the digitization

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:54,600
and go it is not very complex track and

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:57,959
it's just his nose relativity of within

00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:04,559
education is to people to will what it

00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:08,819
stood for example one of the problem is

00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:11,129
that as ashes are random it makes a

00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:14,160
random right so it's not very good for a

00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:17,870
history because they don't like a random

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:22,829
right and the heat makes the right slope

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:26,850
with the insertion of the ashes sudden

00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:31,459
everything is very good and I saw the

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:37,259
cryptographic hash use a lot of CPU time

00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:41,040
so maybe we could use our ashes non

00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:43,019
cryptographic and very is the worst

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,980
point of the first place is that for

00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:51,839
each 40 Baxter because with use of your

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:57,749
back system to match the blood sizes fsm

00:10:51,839 --> 00:11:03,709
you have a key bytes of memory in one of

00:10:57,749 --> 00:11:11,329
a shitty in Iran because this will be 0

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:16,110
between media as actually just invite

00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:25,050
underline it back so the Presidente

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:30,300
image 1 so the word program to be the

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:34,440
key register if you go to and the memory

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:37,589
usage need to be released and if the

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,920
also need to be configurable his request

00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:47,190
of the blog developer for example if a

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:50,190
user which is which which has some

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:53,759
problem with memory usage is the

00:11:50,190 --> 00:12:04,139
treasure need to able to read it's a

00:11:53,759 --> 00:12:09,569
memory fast I was told to meet us about

00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:13,949
what to major ed special so for the

00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:19,199
right path if you want to write fast on

00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:22,829
SSD you need to make large the concert

00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:25,589
right maybe around the side of one

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:29,009
arrived block so there are two units and

00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:31,319
then the CD the page which is something

00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:34,560
like the cluster you can't write

00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:37,290
something smaller than the page and the

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,880
page are grouped into an error in block

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:44,550
and we try to modify page of android raj

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:48,810
desa team will arrive the world lot

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:53,029
around five hundred kilobytes and then

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:57,089
rewrite the rural road so this is a

00:12:53,029 --> 00:13:01,589
breakfast room we need to be careful

00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:09,019
about that because they are very very

00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:14,360
fast modernist yes and we were in the 9

00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:18,110
g thousand a year personal so

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:21,529
can't go very fast but you need to make

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:25,970
the query in peril if you do some random

00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:29,769
breathe in 11 after another the

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:37,519
performance will be divided by 10

00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:43,070
promoter with SOS that when you use the

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:46,550
summer consumer right straight when you

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:52,790
wrote them may be free of factors and

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:58,690
I'm they are dead so we cope with that

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:58,690
and find the an edifice that a structure

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:07,640
so to stop Russia's there's a few

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:12,399
well-known attractive and some of the

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:16,610
normal number 30 I will start with 91

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:19,010
the first one is the disc a stable so

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,350
basically ears it's a very simple a

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,870
sable under stable is the collection of

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:27,050
bucket and each purchase contain

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:30,829
multiple action so here you are back yet

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:35,839
uh no job yet amazon okay when you write

00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:39,260
a rash on a stable you take makeup / but

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,170
is ash who have amended then you look at

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:46,070
the correct Burkett you read it from

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:49,850
disk and you have your data if you want

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:57,260
to write to keep the relief on disk and

00:14:49,850 --> 00:15:02,329
wet so the first thing is that if you if

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:08,510
we want to write maybe 40 bytes we need

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:12,250
to rewrite a world cluster and if

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:15,890
teammates Twitter eraser and Sadie

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:21,529
because as the ashes are random it will

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:25,790
look at here then right at random so

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:27,190
this triggers my anticipation and it's

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:37,600
very bad for the hip

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:42,850
right so a very special rememory it

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:48,690
ready inra and after some time

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:52,390
aggression so this two bands are good I

00:15:48,690 --> 00:16:05,050
join between I of the zone over computer

00:15:52,390 --> 00:16:08,500
teacher room the leaves are on the in

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:15,270
betweens as a very well on its around

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:18,880
for longer than me so mad be good but

00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:23,130
for comparable it will you must travel

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:31,090
the three fiscal gap here and here Thank

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:40,240
really so it's a dangerous and for the

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:45,460
insertion you must miss Delia and if you

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:50,580
may ask ruby three as you do so in a son

00:16:45,460 --> 00:17:00,370
locas yoga right and it doesn't serve

00:16:50,580 --> 00:17:03,970
random right for that also you want to

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:07,420
be around accessing you must block the

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,730
path of the tree and quickly become a

00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,420
mess in the crowd because it's very

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,420
complex to do

00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:28,700
so I thought for other consultants or up

00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:33,440
and iphone side which is very nice it

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:41,450
made for education in fact that inept

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:45,710
and size that very syrup because was

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:52,130
very coastal most nursing it's a very

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:56,590
nice data structure of the back it is

00:17:52,130 --> 00:18:02,900
very complex the disability magicians

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:06,710
three stage and the data around the

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:14,570
lines of code so we got use this into

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:17,990
people we need to simplify it I found

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:24,710
another paper done by Microsoft which is

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:28,250
the fresh supplies act and it does some

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:31,760
different attack so the approach I

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:39,920
system combines these two papers to with

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:43,640
the something popsicles so we good as

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:48,790
the pouring following property so good

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,790
for C D it's a speaker maybe

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,190
you

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,290
you

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:21,049
d and f 2 stages in to pass the right

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:24,530
ash into a lobby and eat so I feel a big

00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:26,660
buffer which is around the side of a

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,420
neural block then I flushes the first

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:33,860
two discs when it's cool and I fit the

00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:38,510
lock this way when we stop a flash drug

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:42,980
and making crib Rita I I realized alone

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:49,850
and in parallel to this dog I with an

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:54,530
ear I'm a saber to prefer the second

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:57,710
stage so cute I this year us the

00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:05,840
anti-drug and in parallel I saw the rush

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:10,520
into the inner amassed ever staged to

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:15,770
look at this when the enroll as table is

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:20,919
full I just don't eat two discs so I

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:27,200
call this an incarnation and then I will

00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:33,530
arrest the log and here the ram a stable

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:36,530
and restart him when the second was

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:38,980
sometimes do as a very full I moved

00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:44,390
first inclination the second place and

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:50,179
dump the table to the first place so it

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:56,240
will be another incarnation and disc so

00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:59,660
looking at the look up in the isobaric

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,270
achieve if you do it just a single the

00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,020
tricky part is to look up the

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:08,320
Incarnation with a blini away for each

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,320
one

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:21,700
so the cut the filter for each

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:25,600
incarnation a filter is the same as a

00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:29,380
bird that initial is best with some

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:33,580
smear smaller ashes which are big slide

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:37,030
of the ashes ridin disc so everything

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:40,330
needs the same Edition hits a nice

00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:43,900
manner and the factor can be used frog

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:47,380
an explanation we can move up into the

00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:49,900
feature the fixer and say oh I must read

00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:58,690
from his inclinations Oh Archie third

00:22:49,900 --> 00:23:01,720
yeah so we have on this confession which

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:11,500
is a unstable and yes physiologies

00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:14,620
smaller and if we look up if we try to

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:18,400
do look up we first try to look up into

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:20,860
the lasting work and if the rash is not

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,280
into the stable with first we will

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:27,610
proceed to prop the first hitter from

00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,960
the second one until we find the filter

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:38,010
where the proper return true and then we

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:43,840
only one with from hitch so regime is

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:46,920
done at some time the only thing is that

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,960
is that the only believe that

00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,450
international will grow forever there

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,600
will be there will be more in our

00:23:52,450 --> 00:24:00,760
intention so something that we can do at

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:03,520
run time to set a memory anomaly is to

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:07,020
drop some scissors the only impact is at

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:10,390
the dedication ratio will be lowered so

00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:14,910
it without say oh and if I'm drug list

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,910
and start again

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:33,890
I say that so what is the cottages the

00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:39,740
CC vector is a Triton and it needs to be

00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:44,450
involved because because the early a lot

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:52,309
of work on is and we don't want to make

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:57,280
it offers all the damaging aftermath

00:24:52,309 --> 00:25:01,520
there are we hear about making fast

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:06,230
follow the loop caps all done in a

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:08,660
second sir while it means that the

00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:13,730
sugars will be done one after another

00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:17,030
and the onion SED we just give a slow

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:20,570
results so the code we need to be

00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:25,870
welcome to make his peril make it a

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:29,450
chakra nice to be adequate for SSD and

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:32,990
also to the cryptographic hash function

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:36,920
is a very slow I use the cane which is

00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:41,929
around 400 megabytes passive investor

00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:44,750
still abandon so maybe we could feel

00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:51,020
like a city ash its absolute I google

00:25:44,750 --> 00:26:00,140
and it goes very fast start to optimize

00:25:51,020 --> 00:26:03,590
for you go back to expansion if you what

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:07,550
I bring my laptop because I left hip

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:13,670
that imbecile an alley last year so the

00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:16,520
see if it works for example the user can

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:21,050
create a test point got to go to images

00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:23,960
of 10 10 gigabytes and use the key co2

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:27,650
and the strategic format then we call

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:36,080
tribute run with them and

00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:40,190
just use the file on the gas I format

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:48,560
the fire I meant it and then I look at

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:51,790
the size of slashes are mega back and if

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:56,980
capilla de souza into multiple

00:26:51,790 --> 00:27:02,000
distension into in the education volume

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:06,250
rated the relative ruin our own sweet

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:11,560
it's readable and then I think

00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:16,400
synchronizes the volume so battle lost

00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:20,000
if we look at the size volume and he's a

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,090
tracer on one that wanted a bike so the

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,890
it does the duplicate well-received is

00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:37,010
to replace the flex lewis to get smells

00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:40,190
and make it fast I will going to look

00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:45,110
like to suck my sponsors deliberate work

00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:48,770
until it's very good the border is not

00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:52,310
so common and what contact me you can

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:56,570
attack me here I forgot to put my videos

00:27:52,310 --> 00:28:27,440
on this page composite you have a

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:33,550
question the coroner me txt we check em

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:37,850
this is a subsystem and when the

00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:40,620
education go back the right I 0 vector

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:45,900
is easily one

00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:50,250
the road after another and so it will do

00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:55,190
the query in our store one when ash

00:28:50,250 --> 00:29:00,750
after another and it's not good for icd

00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:05,250
so the idea would be to maybe to forget

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:08,160
to compute a set of ashes and then do

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:12,720
the query in parallel so this he will

00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:17,760
ever maybe 10 of 16 she still kept at

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:23,190
one and if you go fast because the NSA

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:27,990
Jesus unit to death and infusion you is

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:32,340
for and on a commercial where they say

00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:35,540
it's a 32 so if you want full

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:42,240
performance of your SSD you must issue

00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:56,510
32 great adult if I so that what's left

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:56,510
to do wish we could all good add in turn

00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:11,040
could in fact a deposit and to calculate

00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:17,480
an Android secure them oh that will be a

00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:22,830
bomb but right up to the user to decide

00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:35,250
Nicoli in fact the deduplication ratio

00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:41,780
you get rid of merging connection inside

00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:41,780
I make it especially for him

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:38,130
Drake is a turn in predictions

00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:42,700
dedication of the guests images is a

00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:47,440
similar system images are either already

00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:49,900
done because the people do snapshot so

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,800
when you have a tree structure of fun

00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,800
team to the same

00:32:33,910 --> 00:33:16,510
I don't know if I can make these people

00:32:39,310 --> 00:34:45,429
that is very cool glad to the I was

00:33:16,510 --> 00:34:45,820
working on that right there it's very

00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:51,960
very

00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:55,660
well where the you have a great thing

00:34:51,960 --> 00:35:16,770
template that you copy out across a

00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:16,770
couple of volumes rose there's a change

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:39,930
but but anyway so the commentator is I

00:35:37,240 --> 00:36:03,550
think it's great for the cute hello

00:35:39,930 --> 00:36:18,460
there's any o it and that's going to

00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:23,700
save you space I'm trying to save not

00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:32,250
only has deep more so all right because

00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:37,830
it was though that that we were just so

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,830
on an algorithm they just turned it

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:46,840
screaming fast and and the lines is good

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:51,910
but I wanted to to turn me on the

00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:54,450
opposite end and say that long with your

00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,450
cave

00:37:12,100 --> 00:39:00,770
they have to be one only one only one

00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:04,900
image and I think it will be difficult

00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,900
to DD b day across the patches

00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:36,090
i'm using the infrastructure of internet

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:41,260
snapchat 2k2 to control RC for global

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:48,790
this yes but I made them smaller so it

00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:52,180
much x 24 of the guests yes Ralph on

00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:56,680
oxygen maybe though due to a loose until

00:39:52,180 --> 00:40:01,140
the block and Christina are totally

00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:06,280
location so i suppose that we need a

00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:39,460
group education at least a little closer

00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:43,060
at one is configured but i don't hear

00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:52,270
always could make for and which you call

00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:54,760
him I don't see it would work yes but

00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:56,710
i'm using the logical technical

00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,780
