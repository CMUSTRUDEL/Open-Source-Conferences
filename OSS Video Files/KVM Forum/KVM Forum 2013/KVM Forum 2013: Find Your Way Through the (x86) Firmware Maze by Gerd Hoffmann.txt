SeaBIOS, TianoCore, coreboot, iPXE, UEFI, CSM, ACPI, fw_cfg, oh my! This talk will sort all those acronyms, show which firmwares exist in the qemu world and how they interact with each other. I'll also explain how the hardware configuration and initialization works in qemu and which interfaces are used to handle this.
