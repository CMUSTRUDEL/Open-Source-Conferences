QEMU has long been missing the capability to provide 3D rendering capabilities to guest OSes. The Virgil3D project aims to to provide a virtual GPU device that can be used by guest OSes to provide OpenGL or Direct3D capabilities. The host side of the device will use OpenGL on the host to render the command stream from the guest. The command stream will be based on the Mesa project's Gallium3D framework, using similar states and shader encoding.

Note: Unfortunately, audio quality is low due to interference in the conference room. There's no better audio track available as we were not able to connect to room audio system.

brisbane yeah i'm i am not at the

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:12,840
virtualization team in case i wonder why

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:21,869
they don't know where our graphics for

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:26,609
your government do the take me to

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:33,140
do a profile based trainee capable GPU

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,140
so that cutie doesn't get prime system

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,860
our acceleration so first of all this is

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:49,530
epic time for any product and good maybe

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,320
it's me I've Benjamin's work I want to

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,930
get it started in the time I forgive you

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,870
I'm hoping to that one change that at

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,449
the moment that my disclaimer and his

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,100
main focus hard so far has been working

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,189
on the Trinity side of this time to

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,939
figure out how to make advertiser pretty

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:14,670
much work I think I get familiar is

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:18,090
possible i own qumu code the ideas the

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,710
3d GPU design is based on a thing we

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,960
have in the mesa project to disney open

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,369
source 3d graphics a project called

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,049
gallium treaty which is a it's like this

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,900
intermediate representation is what we

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:36,630
call it but it's basically at the

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:39,600
interface between specific good and evil

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,810
inside the mesa visible is being used

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,619
for a lot of them and i started like all

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:51,270
the pretty stuff GL director and it

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:53,670
takes a lot of and makes it into a sort

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,159
of standard size inter pixel we used so

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,680
far solving little sort of looked at

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,210
selected the past what I haven't done it

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:06,689
yet is a big project to do it right

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:08,670
driver for something like this just in

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,989
the area

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,090
there are some projects that have looked

00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,760
at this before image heard of some of

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,709
these definitely have been done so there

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,159
was a V galleon project which was done

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:23,860
as a research project with then involved

00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,019
and it relies on gallium drivers in the

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,459
host so that was sort of a non-starter

00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:31,480
for us we didn't really want to have

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:34,269
this you must have a specific driver in

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,010
all but it was facing a very old version

00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:40,780
of guy it was totally unmaintained it

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:47,609
one off we did it research in terms of

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:55,690
acting funny music for something what

00:02:47,609 --> 00:03:02,620
extra boxes GL is your babe there is a

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:07,150
flash up and security of it is time to

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:09,250
point out that respect yeah I'm going to

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,140
cost you a lot of problems at the end

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,880
where have their FCPA to device I think

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,030
they'd have a newer version of that came

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,919
up its door they have my own story

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,049
drivers for Minister so you can see

00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,269
about the interface work that you can't

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:24,599
get onions with the design but don't

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:27,549
help you have you make something better

00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,810
sighs we'll talk to us and I have talked

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,599
to them for a number of years and they

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,569
have no it's also based on Direct X

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,650
naught which is old a one-out base

00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:41,620
record of the 11 coming up soon and

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:46,450
projects it here know that work if I'm

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:50,530
right and it was a duty solution based

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:54,190
around with a female I think we should

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:57,040
work with that but it would complicate

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,530
zoom anyway that's it on top of my

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,290
things to do but look at their little

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:06,099
scratches / hi / everyone in Ohio the

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:10,629
basis of five super coyote this is going

00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:13,840
to be interesting so what are these

00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:16,180
components of this project how many

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,250
pieces of acting work on so this is just

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,650
a quick sense diagram of where the

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,880
functionality for this project is so I

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:27,400
am

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:31,090
on the the whole size inside a human we

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:35,140
have to have a bio GPU is the standard

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:39,490
part I'll a device work on mm I told the

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:42,190
planet my OPC RPG all look perfect and a

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,640
large from the rendering code render is

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:49,300
the taste look not from the get and use

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:54,850
all the girls out the retro and display

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:57,550
so that to jump on me get is key to have

00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:02,950
a completely honest graphics driver back

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:04,770
which is a beer mkmf an excellent driver

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,630
component which is called as EPS

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,730
animated of gallium driver so these

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,300
three components live inside in the hope

00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:17,800
we have forever graphics card the same

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,810
sort of system a finales player theorem

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,890
came as far as respond furnish wasn't a

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:27,870
hard work setting would imagine memory a

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:30,490
fop is made for letting actual

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,020
recreation I'm answering to Center

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,600
hardware and the Guardian drivers made

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,970
for translating the gallium interface

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,430
into command streams to send to the hard

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,200
work and it's a basis and the generic

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,630
functionality or convert the guest

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,390
opengl layer with the gallium first we

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,070
don't need to look at information how

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,340
this would lock on windows it I think

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:55,060
it's probably the same for windows 7 and

00:05:51,340 --> 00:06:00,370
8 but it's direct it is different enough

00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:04,720
but windows 7 or 8 a-7 p DX or the notes

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,880
for the three places there are called

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,870
done in mesa to allow us to reuse some

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,490
of the functionality so we could

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,810
actually the gaudiya battle will be

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,850
actually useful in windows and we had

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,710
another layer to chocolate directx got

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,570
in which the end where I half but

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,730
haven't open sourced but look they're

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:22,960
working on something similar so they

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:28,450
aren't major pieces of it so how does it

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:31,030
from the virtualization side so I'm

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:35,550
started off with just a single mark I

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,930
o-ring thank you it's responsible for

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,590
is where treaty however get complicated

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,780
i will put know what really hard work

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,820
with you basically need to have context

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,710
so the survival rate is responsible for

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,020
context management you need it would

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,540
create destroy attaches or versus

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,280
destroyed resources and destroy

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,080
resources in the complex is for security

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,470
reason you don't want one context in

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,880
able to just pull up equity i eat the

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,480
context of resources on the motor

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,600
contact sir got 3d resources that you

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,040
want to manage for duty resources are at

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,890
least three resources right if you

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,090
wanted to create destroyed and attach

00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,420
scatter gather and attached together

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:20,380
because when i first looked at it I was

00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:22,960
using part i oh um for every time ever

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,690
for every vertical to put on the queue

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,230
queue entry I was putting attaching the

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,300
object Jewish the number of entries in

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,840
the objects were way bigger invertible

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,090
to deal with a clearing I'm worst agent

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,910
eating at four or five thousands for

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,370
some small makeup I sorta have to change

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:46,630
her mind I'm not going to it just having

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:48,820
a specific thing here all the XPS pics

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,250
for this object these two and then use

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,830
that from then on and validate and this

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,050
is a problem we have DNA like transfer

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,490
function for this is basically I have a

00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,200
resource things with something in it I

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,130
resorting to get something out of it

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,500
there's no RX actress from the guests to

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,410
a linear representation on the whole

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,120
side because weight of jail works you

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,240
never have that and if you want to

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,390
render using l at the you know the next

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,100
stage decide we should have no linear

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,919
axis between that you will use transfer

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:26,650
the IMP a dinner out of the objects that

00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:29,650
are on the whole side of making up come

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,510
on stream so this is all sort of little

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,669
level management of the harbor is

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,530
another chunk of functionally if it's

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,000
sort of command trees and sends those

00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,680
that's the way standard 3d hardware

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,550
works as well I am divorce is also

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,930
responsibilities so we want to be able

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:48,670
to go my post has able to do the gal4 so

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,329
my guests could probably do Geo for my

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,129
host has

00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:54,899
some other features our app and it's

00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:57,699
just yet but i guess i need a later

00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,989
here's a list of things i can do what

00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:01,629
does that mean for the guests so that's

00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:03,699
what managed in this ring and anything

00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:06,069
called same things penalty word is

00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:08,079
another treaty render determine if

00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:09,850
basically you first you send a hold of

00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,709
stuff to the harbor we presented many

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,209
suppose the work with the painting and

00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:16,329
then the hard work helping percent of

00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:18,549
the rock music exactly similar model for

00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:20,559
this is just you can an irq never

00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:22,569
offense expires to say everything before

00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,970
that point Delta you freedom three

00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:26,529
separate your freezer use it it sort of

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,639
like notifies as you get up there

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:35,470
virtual cues and then I have also a

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:38,350
config space using the QD me to fix or

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,149
as vertical 68 I was usually using that

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,369
for reading back the same thing so the

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,689
tourney to number of things up I just

00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:46,449
read that from the config space I don't

00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:49,360
want be doing oq operation it goes back

00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:50,799
and curse I am begging you probably that

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,869
we're going to queue up cursor handling

00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,579
so much you generally just want to take

00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:56,589
where's the cursor now I want to know

00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:58,949
where it is not or analogy just you want

00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:01,540
to tell if the hard word which is also

00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:03,910
you don't want to sort of Q of thousands

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:09,339
of curse words curse with Professor it's

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:10,899
like get way too much information um so

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,970
then the other people that would be

00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:15,100
commands pretty piece above that what

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:18,790
the bottom goes is that this would be

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:22,029
actual three-letter code so the gallium

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:23,949
driver in that in mesa produces all the

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,709
commands rain thank you to the car the

00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:30,100
car path of the truth of the air and

00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:32,829
then host right this is how come it is

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,509
really into the whole fish active

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:37,360
objects these are gallium it all

00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:39,970
disappears or in any way to make it

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,639
without reading and rework blending

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:45,699
rasterization give it depth and so alpha

00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,470
the shaders distempers those queries you

00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:49,779
need to create these objects find them

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,639
troy them and there were some things

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:54,399
that are moving objects setting a flavor

00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,649
for state scissors deport and we have

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,379
commands just draw but i'm giving

00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:01,089
open-faced draw us update care buffers

00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:02,660
flesh which is just move stuff around

00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:06,350
the copy

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:09,259
so this is all you've never responds GL

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:13,220
interfaces or three databases these are

00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:15,680
all objects that they produce so I just

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,170
generally take the gallium interface I

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,879
mean in your eyes is pretty much into a

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,189
command three minutes and a command

00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:26,540
strain across the oath and host on

00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:30,110
access so what does the host half when

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:32,329
it gets it so the host has a renderer

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,120
this is the big chunk functionality lost

00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:37,490
quite a lot in here this takes your

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:42,709
dreams our dreams and put them back into

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:44,480
OpenGL if it seems like every invited

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:46,009
guests it's taken to yell something to

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,319
Guardian Media hours on the back well

00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:50,149
that should be a rod simple operation it

00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:53,120
doesn't always work up the world a lot

00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:54,620
cornish bubbles word g elders to be

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,050
consistent of the lock is from

00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:00,079
geologists if you won't back you go from

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:02,689
0 cube factor of dl use you get

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,160
information you have it internally and

00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:07,550
it only has a new interface for that

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,540
engine stopped by the night ok so the

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:14,839
record name is newer convert gallium to

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:20,139
GL shade language to GRS el-shater

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:24,709
language and for a while I don't joke

00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:27,230
all I thought xk with GL context for

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:29,449
already living a guest this run into a

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,519
problem for get your like in a case

00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:35,029
where others let me do something that it

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,860
requires hard work to do so I end up

00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:39,500
having them implement the whole context

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,620
in this context which is not okay with

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,899
one of those problems and it works i

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,790
became a little TG over the drivers is

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:53,420
running on its X's and sends them into

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:55,279
the guest I don't a real glsl 134

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,480
writing the shader programs it will

00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,740
probably have to go off if they have

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,600
different instrument and so what does it

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,939
mean for what we're running into get her

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,990
in the guests I'm exposing opengl 2.1

00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:12,709
GoSL 120 just gets me basics and

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,809
functionalities of the hardware ID real

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,850
maybe six in some cases maybe asian

00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,819
order to Intel

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,250
probably four or five years old probably

00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:23,170
eight years ago and it's also where

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,769
vmware's and where they've been sort of

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,990
stuck for a long time and the host

00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:31,000
requirements r GL 21 and gos at 130

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:35,589
which is probably still hot rid of 34

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,329
years old five worked yechiel tree in

00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:39,329
the host it's working I've worked as a

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:46,720
certain thing again GL isn't physically

00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:48,100
go off here's some data no and you're

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,600
like okay but I want a high one ish I

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,509
need to get the data back then give it

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,800
to you later yeah so you've got some

00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:55,540
corner kids we're going oh I need to

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,769
figure out what this doll my data I'll

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:03,279
get Howie then we get back and OpenGL

00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:05,860
3.1 above is really messy other people

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,540
again it's one of those you have to know

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,880
how GL works what they were going to

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:13,480
change the standardization and remove

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,940
all the compatibility stuff and it kind

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,130
of is that that's it kind of in the ad

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,079
Alexa compatibility stuff in a special

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:26,709
extension the open-source drivers door

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:30,459
exposes rocking the treatment want it

00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:33,850
all the appeal of running on a host that

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:39,819
have 3.1 that is you all over well

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:41,410
that's kind of the Red Room may have to

00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:42,689
come a bit more complicated to deal with

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:59,240
that may have to start emulating

00:14:42,689 --> 00:15:04,570
ultimatum opengl me guess so

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:10,029
point of view partner part of treating

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:14,660
integrated with you you and we should i

00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:18,440
respond to gradually later what about

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:25,700
you definitely atomic fact they can fix

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:28,490
this is kind of 2a 1362 angeles sick of

00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,620
changed so much that admission into the

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:36,589
stage and i'll just send you a fixed

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:43,279
days that put my way to engage okay babe

00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:46,580
my culture of it fired this is my first

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:51,589
pass of this was the colonel reb of God

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:55,160
is a big mismatch of the cotton paste

00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:59,120
code from the vertex confuse my driver a

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:03,170
few other places implies it work in the

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,950
recent arrest but how to get an i refute

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:11,870
Oliver cube irq in a fair trial only

00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:13,279
device I was I can do this I maybe I

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,660
could just use a sexy Burke you thought

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,779
but I think that might be hopeful for

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:25,100
what I want on really just an effective

00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:26,690
her cute for that yes slightly I wanted

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,920
to apply the config space in truck

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:32,660
because I want to deform it is it didn't

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,120
do that yeah i'll be looking a traffic

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,649
up Austin more alpha one of those who is

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,810
also mythical and some ago oh that's

00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:42,430
really bad what is it you should do this

00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:44,959
are there's no nice way to do this I

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,089
make us yeah we talked to a few people

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,450
just one of those of not reassure the

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:52,370
best way of data and and again GL tree

00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:55,610
point X the contact region probably

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,130
deprecating other rendered all of OpenGL

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,380
pub- on jail is a big issue that I've

00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:04,370
sort of pushed away in book would come

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:07,699
back so i'll give them on this later

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:09,319
that's pretty much the core work I've

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,669
done on the sort of research project the

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,799
treaty housing a networking

00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:18,669
work in same I've got no children that

00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:22,039
game running I've got a new apps running

00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:24,470
but if on a very very unstable basic

00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:30,189
attacker that make something like a demo

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,189
a good run like you would not want to be

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,230
so that sort of led me to our I better

00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:41,659
do this property so I started on another

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:43,279
project to do this differently rajarani

00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:46,759
started working with a few weeks ago

00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:49,399
properly but I wanted an engine you're

00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:51,350
looking at doing this vertical view

00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:54,259
before so the right well maybe I should

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,370
try and take over that and so basically

00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:58,850
we want to do a project that just

00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:00,919
produces a basis perfect spp I can then

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,470
attach my renderer to separately as a

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,210
capability so it was not there I guess

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,100
doesn't say anything but it is very same

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,580
power cycle work and guess what is

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,710
everyone will just follow that if the

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,080
multi-headed capable in the drivers

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,029
currently and really do multi I suppose

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,429
ahead with space at the spice level not

00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:22,549
until you level with hidden above it all

00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:24,559
and in Eastern Oregon accelerators nice

00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:26,450
work accelerated as well but the basic

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,940
idea is beyond accelerated so we can

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,789
just use it for just rendering excellent

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:35,600
militaries are just the console and and

00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:41,360
it needs to work for a basic i/o device

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:44,240
for my overtime old pci and vga and i

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,000
said i started looking at this a few few

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,559
weeks ago and one of the first things i

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,279
came across was all multi has how would

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,230
i do that well SEL 1.2 of the new multi

00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:57,620
head when the multi-window i feel for

00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:02,740
two that are serving the side Rogers

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:06,559
again I got sidetracked i4 TQ to stl to

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:09,289
a lot of a portal to but it's finally

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:14,149
done because of the separate files are

00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:16,580
doing it in FB LLC for it to be

00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:19,129
transported way better on GL support us

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:23,210
to EG out of our chinese for something

00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:26,210
and it has a whole new way of doing it

00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:32,360
so I never have to be pls

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:38,210
I'm actually no hard work but yeah it's

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:41,180
nothing really changed my 55 guy who

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:44,770
does all the infant's the practice of

00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:47,150
suffer I have seems like this make me

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:49,640
sick so i can go oh yeah and i can

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:52,010
figure it out but at the time for the

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,080
resident that mostly happen we do every

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:59,320
2,000 SEL to that's leading to them if

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,320
definitely as much as well from matter

00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,980
and and of course the CUNY's comfort

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:10,940
coded as pulses largely it doesn't deal

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:18,890
with multi head either I did this one

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:21,830
way I and basically a you want a

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:24,140
multiple reflects offices / awkward I

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,300
did an index released when you could

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,920
have talked to I use the SEO multi

00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,340
window stuff to do a demo which I'll

00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,320
show you and maybe night after HC arrays

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,230
of the favor absolutely everything was

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,700
with the access control objects when I

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,550
had multiple windows i think it was

00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,230
getting confused over to the only thing

00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:45,590
even though i got all the windows on the

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:48,740
screen it in my mind this is just it's

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,810
just got multiple tests as opposed to be

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,560
in case that for console to the object

00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:56,450
we have multiple appearances I've only

00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,590
had on one card I think it made much

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:02,360
more sense again we have to look at that

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:10,370
one of the soon how do I got in many

00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:17,120
instances true it's a configuration

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:19,520
problem possibly oh yeah why the FDL

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,060
this is so much other options I have an

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,330
insider's view and from a Boltzmann it

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:29,180
all the most recent spike in see

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:32,120
anything are promoting exist they all

00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:36,320
require reading x axis doses of Agra and

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:39,660
for training that really really really

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,430
nice every frame from the graphics card

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,890
and then drawing it on screen because

00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:46,770
the battle already has information I

00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:48,960
want to go up on the screen oh yes I do

00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:52,230
with the other come idea of how fast I

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,740
could make this and actually run a

00:21:52,230 --> 00:22:01,200
little GL stop doing real time for

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:03,390
everything to myself oh man that was one

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,820
of the main reasons only thing done with

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:13,740
SPL actually running after using this

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:15,570
works because I'm able to you so now

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,900
I've a very happy configuration for the

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:26,910
dark lair my didn't launch it on my

00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:31,110
local place as briefly the personal life

00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:37,890
start working pretty good I'm 42 added

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:44,580
so I'm a lovely case so again I'd like

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:47,450
to do differ in come on like this just

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:50,100
using our standard manager set up there

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:53,850
what happened with the problem is that

00:22:50,100 --> 00:23:00,860
you love that literally unisono

00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:05,310
summer so I can't really explain really

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:09,210
the only if you have access the X in

00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:12,330
this way you can't go without seeing the

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:16,290
retinopathy of this way we're going

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:20,280
forward we have at the egl which is like

00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:24,750
a embed ajeno so sore but it's not all

00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:26,010
fun and let you just want it so you can

00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,930
actually have Q to be running in the

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:31,560
sandbox you need a graphics card a

00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:37,770
device notes and rendering the image i

00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:42,050
think its problems so we have work in

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:45,830
the conservation project 7 for a shelter

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:54,410
The Venus Project of the aromaticity

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:54,410
allow that favorite running executed

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:06,010
I think about it we called DNA which was

00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:08,679
kind of ugly to share that's two doors

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,390
between offices using file descriptors

00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,580
so you can answer the father square

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,950
using human soccer and then it can open

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:19,480
it and get a handle for graphical

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:21,850
objects you actually holding back 0 so

00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:26,080
my sort of idea it would be a third

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:28,659
monitor fewer but it implements egl out

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,399
of it and we'll talk using will also use

00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:31,840
exhaustion you will get the father

00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:33,640
spectra back though you should be

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,250
displaying this image is what I rendered

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,200
to the curb for when you go stepping

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,659
onto remoting how to react to the remote

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,659
but for an honorable local pollution on

00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:45,940
the laptop where you wanted to be fast

00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:48,850
maybe it was really fun actually usable

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:52,179
fastest a deal once a game just tested

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,919
to work so yeah the idea then we can

00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:58,510
build a sword Arctic to react to be able

00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:01,120
to DGL in December and in hand polish

00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:04,090
retrospect viewers the local machine is

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:10,630
using twice already he'll just read back

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:14,409
the image and then give this model there

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:17,380
is also an area private I look too far

00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:19,779
to get it how do we need to move it

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:24,070
remoting was deliberately left out of my

00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:25,919
initial limitation because the people

00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:29,710
should do if I removing the

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:36,789
mainstreamers desirable finally reading

00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:38,710
collect the air song so far points of

00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:46,570
the promoting using rendering treated

00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:51,490
wrong with this demonic people but

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:56,799
feeling like I playing applause we

00:25:51,490 --> 00:26:00,340
thought they tried it I don't know cm

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:04,390
don't do this very so

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:06,520
they fish if you don't know when it's

00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,529
not going to work okay physically get

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,600
results okay might just work for me up

00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:11,950
right now I could launch one out and it

00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,710
will just stop working it will be too

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:19,480
much data everything will go from these

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:22,240
premises infinite run back please how do

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,429
you do this product again it's outside

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,779
my area I'm not a huge so that person

00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:31,360
seems to move them for using h264 doing

00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:34,600
I think the nvidia great guys do is a

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,020
render on the GPU and an h.264 and told

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,059
even any passing info the frame so they

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,970
really expect that's all you really

00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:44,620
really protected as you can for like

00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,350
everything is the thing for you to do it

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:50,529
they make you feel encoding the vid that

00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:53,980
I've got a partner model it refuses put

00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:55,149
them in a cpu because they don't want to

00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:00,250
read it back that's all they want is

00:26:55,149 --> 00:27:02,169
Lloyd is the reason why so enough sort

00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:06,210
of like the bases where that would we

00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:08,409
are looking into possible codec and

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,350
streaming androidguys of runners

00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:14,289
screaming the data also suffers from

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:17,169
this image that's fine if you're not

00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:19,899
working you just got again if you're a

00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:24,580
deaf have given the guy up all of the

00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:27,820
data you disconnect of the opl so I'm

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:30,220
not anything from perfect so if you do

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:34,080
want to read back which if you use gnome

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:38,770
shell mouse it reads that one pixel from

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,980
every again we pick them up please

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:44,649
master light up doing that over a

00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:49,210
network would be intolerably slowed

00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:51,940
because it just wasn't even billions in

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:54,880
killing but to avoid the laser render

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:58,059
lovely name of rendering looking at my

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,010
degree and then ISS robot certificates

00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:02,350
different images because of guilt on

00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:07,510
this guy's in the video card descargar

00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:08,919
musica are going to be accurate it sort

00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,970
of the great is one of these this is

00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:13,960
gonna get Nora more the core as well as

00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:19,120
other problems

00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:20,919
during streaming rendering that yes we

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,140
might actually be something up as well

00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:25,029
Enterprise a year your people have

00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,370
desktop from they don't want the desktop

00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:32,320
to just go away on this connect you're

00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:34,179
going to have feel these so that's

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:39,580
pretty much my before I have a couple of

00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:42,330
demos I'm just hoping it off and try to

00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:50,110
divert the 3d run again was actually

00:28:42,330 --> 00:29:10,390
surprisingly not rushing I'm just hope

00:28:50,110 --> 00:29:29,110
you'll fit in the screen just now it

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:31,380
doesn't start so just a vm booting up

00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,380
with

00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:58,740
so that no gel I don't have a car sir a

00:29:53,220 --> 00:30:00,960
zombie cat that turn off the fpl to have

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,240
also a RGB / surrendered which I feel

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,190
hopeful 2000 have I actually hacked it

00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:11,610
up for demos that G Alexander the cursor

00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:21,690
but it its violence table the lines are

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:22,890
not mine by go inside window so I will

00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:28,980
do what everyone does it on shows just

00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:30,660
one from we get it all sensitive running

00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,670
on top of the virtual GPU you can see it

00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:36,929
it's the clone exciting i'm over

00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:38,580
log in but it'll entering crack case it

00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:41,400
is all the thing if all using the 12

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:51,870
pack this is on my old code based not on

00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:53,520
new and but also just do it I like I've

00:30:51,870 --> 00:31:01,050
also gotten Wayland working on top of

00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:06,410
the run a few other up gnome shell may

00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:09,510
not have been asking too much that's ok

00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,620
Papa don't tell it's not happy because i

00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,870
haven't instrumented some of the

00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,170
optimizations instituted whole career

00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,170
ender

00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:33,720
so I can't read wrong renderable it's

00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:40,350
actually playable the mouse would work

00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:43,610
properly it has alleged that exactly a

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:47,580
bit or the expected to my framerate but

00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:50,790
running I think native them online the

00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:53,730
other operator was getting some 30

00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:56,880
frames a second and in fact p.m. i would

00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:59,309
ever get like 350 we ever were getting

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,510
around the same so it's been close

00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:04,440
enough to what they've been producing

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:06,750
and I my dear to make it even plastic so

00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,669
just over a sin that that's right

00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,020
natively is another tiny copy it's

00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:19,590
running inside the end of the coffee

00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:23,840
market we add up steam the good demo

00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,840
this is he I'm not sure we work them

00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:31,770
okay I'd only have enough screen space

00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:35,179
to show this I've gotten used to having

00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,179
a very high resolution laptop

00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:20,160
ladies flu but I was any questions which

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:44,700
laughing now I can answer a lot of

00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:47,430
attention to get your public of it yet

00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:52,260
for those of us they are two ports get

00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:57,960
done in and looking for getting I'll

00:33:52,260 --> 00:34:08,130
keep you safe flying public weeks it's

00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:10,200
just doing oh I'm getting up let's go

00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:12,570
into profile GPU peace without having

00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:16,620
tested ready 3d renderings organiz I

00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:20,070
don't want to knock so I'd like to find

00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:23,630
a soft work pretty a lot and happiness

00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:26,190
the design anticipation for legal expose

00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,480
you for the next well laughing is

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:32,370
getting multi-head working getting

00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,870
cultures and and and and I'll get the

00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:37,640
discussion upstream on how exactly is

00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:40,909
going to fit in so this is the second

00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,909
code base

00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,310
yeah i think that make sense refused to

00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:28,120
make sure we keep the graphics them as

00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:30,760
much the management of the the specs and

00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,820
now that mean it that way in for the

00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,460
face d render it's written inside of

00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,920
mixer I've got off base inside a mixer

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,760
and it produces a library then I have QT

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,500
be delayed interface between long as

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,870
four or five functions was not huge and

00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,090
a bigger problem i have is i need to do

00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:52,300
it currently i'm not a GL at reg running

00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:54,370
all your chakra system job i'm getting

00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,380
stuff into that read another visit

00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:58,060
message i think that every one thing the

00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,220
first implementation order GT I wasn't

00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:03,970
used to go to the render are just going

00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:07,840
to use the code figure ologies GLS with

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:10,150
sdl Oh surrender and endemic office got

00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:16,770
my ability nothing see I didn't want to

00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:20,910
say looks great at first there is Z go

00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,910
second you decide where it is

00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,500
unfortunately not gotten the

00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,650
government's organization form unstable

00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:38,230
a gallium is not as experimentation

00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:42,310
piece of me and my current climate is

00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:46,030
daughter sits on a version value for

00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:48,250
these pieces i I'm eating then just when

00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:52,900
the ad features idle features of the

00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:54,880
extras but there's also things like the

00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:58,270
shaders are in this format and I'm

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,710
trying its alberto changer so i can say

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,780
Isis

00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:03,780
only for the shaders of version for

00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,040
don't give me a version 5 shader and the

00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,599
rest will take care of it just won't

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,359
explosive new features that need version

00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:13,440
5 shader I mean if nothing doesn't miss

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:18,270
a project image ya think this is

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,060
sickness probably why it remember they

00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:27,390
allegedly this is running 21 qemu with

00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:34,619
two windows so the other i'm using a see

00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:37,320
up to I also said I haven't and or even

00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:41,339
locked of doing this or are you just

00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:45,839
Indian this well off my in my head Oh

00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:52,560
guess what the end in this type things

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:58,589
on it and it comes this would this is

00:37:52,560 --> 00:38:04,440
not working dashed arrows apart me here

00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:15,089
would forget that operate window of the

00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:16,260
same style into an Tina so yeah I will

00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:21,270
leave that there but yeah baby all

00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:22,680
positive energy p into windows it just

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:26,570
it just shows you to frame up for

00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:30,150
consoles an external start and crisis

00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:37,369
