QEMU has long been missing the capability to provide 3D rendering capabilities to guest OSes. The Virgil3D project aims to to provide a virtual GPU device that can be used by guest OSes to provide OpenGL or Direct3D capabilities. The host side of the device will use OpenGL on the host to render the command stream from the guest. The command stream will be based on the Mesa project's Gallium3D framework, using similar states and shader encoding.

Note: Unfortunately, audio quality is low due to interference in the conference room. There's no better audio track available as we were not able to connect to room audio system.
