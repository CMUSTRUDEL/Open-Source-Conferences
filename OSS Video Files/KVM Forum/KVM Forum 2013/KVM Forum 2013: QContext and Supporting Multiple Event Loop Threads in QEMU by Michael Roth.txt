Moving emulation into the kernel has resulted in substantial performance gains for certain types of devices, but other features such a virtio-blk dataplane have proven that there is still much to be gained by offloading I/O event handling to separate threads in userspace.

QContext is an effort to generalize this approach to improving performance by allowing full command-line control over event loop creation and event handling assignments for device I/O.

This talk will provide an overview of QContext and discuss some of the considerations involved in scaling QEMU's event handling to multiple threads.
