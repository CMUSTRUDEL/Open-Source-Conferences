Title: KVM Forum 2013: QContext and Supporting Multiple Event Loop Threads in QEMU by Michael Roth
Publication date: 2014-10-30

	Slides: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzyAwvVlQckeU0dpbTZjRXRlRUE

Moving emulation into the kernel has resulted in substantial performance gains for certain types of devices, but other features such a virtio-blk dataplane have proven that there is still much to be gained by offloading I/O event handling to separate threads in userspace.

QContext is an effort to generalize this approach to improving performance by allowing full command-line control over event loop creation and event handling assignments for device I/O.

This talk will provide an overview of QContext and discuss some of the considerations involved in scaling QEMU's event handling to multiple threads.

absolutely sorry my name is my block me

00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,130
on sovereign there I'm hamblin there's

00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:35,249
the mountain and I can stay out in the

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:37,370
contest thanks for that that's so it was

00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:39,749
some backgrounds get started here

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,659
historically are two main types of

00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:47,609
threads email was ecp friends kind of

00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:54,019
execution guess who lives here Katie

00:00:47,609 --> 00:01:03,329
Imran taco and also information some

00:00:54,019 --> 00:01:05,729
operations I really they should pretty

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,469
much everything else was a kind of idea

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,780
Julie beanie there's there some other

00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:17,399
breast rubbing on you as well or

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:25,469
transportation in some server annual

00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:28,200
context for the most part human being

00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:32,719
who handles are pretty much everything

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,719
that you to gay a still gets wise

00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:40,920
management or faces caca face it sound

00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:45,810
all that server devices and also or so

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,570
to both sides and then the main one is a

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,969
device either on the cavities features

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:55,220
so things like processing of conversions

00:01:52,969 --> 00:02:01,260
by six

00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:05,700
burning along all the Norview codes

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:10,740
protective of mobile text so at times we

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:14,640
won't read executing up for unicode ECB

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,920
threads can run concurrently with one

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,130
another all they're executing their

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,720
giving run and that's thanks to provide

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,370
that when you're executing under getting

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,140
rounder letting guests really not

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:33,530
speaking importantly but at any one time

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:37,260
when they returned from a few of

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:40,680
relations is the meeting each lot of

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:48,200
bullying types the I over whenever it's

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:52,890
active always ask and because of that

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:57,239
there's a lot of transfer high amounts

00:02:52,890 --> 00:03:03,299
of contention test either have a large

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:05,690
amount of rest large issue world not

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:12,450
only just because every time the peace

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:15,690
exit you have to take a little bit in

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,850
these scenarios every times exit tends

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:24,000
to be for things like between a

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:25,709
hurricane which causes the week would be

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,030
one of the scale a little patience and

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:41,480
skill but as I mentioned earlier these

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:44,480
views can run 06 factor behind after

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,480
solutions

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:53,090
it's it's for some reason settings like

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:57,140
hostnet ethos net processor tools

00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:01,040
without unity times and that also

00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:04,459
happens to be the basis of third type of

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,520
thread that was added the latest o'clock

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:12,950
negatively running out aude deplane

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:17,359
basically in the AO context as it's

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:21,650
being men source that drives an attack

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:25,510
by following the either before the glue

00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:31,640
basically drives event staff needs

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:35,320
callbacks for the ensleg virtual

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:38,660
notifications coming in via these units

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,540
that notify we have really about the

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:47,390
other main connectors work happens

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:52,520
fosters also know when or know about

00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:56,690
they between issues I isn't as I or

00:04:52,520 --> 00:05:01,669
requests also attached to its ki no

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:13,630
contest at least and signal rod

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:16,820
completions like I said the reason that

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:21,680
we're have updated wings able to run or

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:24,290
Antonio Texas largely because similar

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,330
reasons evil stats that it doesn't

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:34,729
execute important use very little

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:37,120
actually uses forced me we hold back be

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,120
hoaxes

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,790
and then thanks for that is absolutely

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:55,720
wire of intensity here but I stepped up

00:05:52,790 --> 00:06:01,040
each other's was a talk about yesterday

00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:05,090
that was never really a n Roll every day

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,730
off it came main benefits people winix

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:12,830
look like that music user spaces because

00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:14,660
its potential use of pictures in the

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,810
locker that are available weapons or

00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:22,490
space so there's a long list of islands

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:26,330
they're very popularly features so it's

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:30,080
a it's a big win that you can do ask a

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:36,470
little higher coupons I with potential

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:38,690
word for combining both your support so

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,930
I mean the main point here is the

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,460
pharmacist about what second phone

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,860
high-performance io ended up pushing

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:50,690
chance of internal still a very

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:55,000
worthwhile effort attitude or improving

00:06:50,690 --> 00:07:04,360
my own performance in user space via

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:07,580
investigation 17 and going to be I

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:12,110
anticipate that seeing more numbers in

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:14,170
that space totally that's happening this

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,170
year

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:25,860
make it so that we can reuse more poor

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:31,979
Jim you code concurrently host multiple

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:38,610
identities things updated make use of

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:41,720
each piece will not support but as we

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:45,090
start looking at doing more and more

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:49,770
inventive implementations of the story

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:54,569
the Russian prices are how you manage

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:58,050
it's actually better looking at other

00:07:54,569 --> 00:08:02,310
devices like the various as a tensioning

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:08,009
human not best devices with post-crisis

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:18,539
and things like that imagines he tagged

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:21,120
and lions foot back so one thing to

00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:25,370
consider is how similarly event

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:29,909
mutations once these different devices

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:33,000
with vastly different event mutations

00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:35,339
depending how many devices and four men

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,450
in the event lose the work you look at

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:41,820
something like where they own that

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:44,339
participants we could potentially do

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,440
something similar in some wipe rely on a

00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:50,279
saying that you went for they all got

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,880
their plane today but the goal is that

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:58,500
has been introduced two types of data

00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:04,260
playing limitations on you we do so with

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:08,180
fees for you in mind rather than relying

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:11,180
on at this base my summation trade

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,180
features

00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:20,629
to gain easier it gets blown to not

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,670
operable so if we take that approach it

00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:25,249
selected for they only have to look at

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:31,819
things like how I'm here as well in this

00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:36,819
matter onions that Hans tapis work for

00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:41,350
Diane has a mess to miriam's as the

00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:44,869
transmit side which lends itself to

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:47,629
implementing a new menu that's

00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:50,119
associated specifically but I on that

00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:52,869
device but there's also people are

00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:56,809
outside which is largely driven by

00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:59,899
posting their the host you want to

00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:04,129
identify when there's incoming data yes

00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:07,069
and one of the threat picture is good

00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:12,980
even respond to that basically svenska

00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:17,480
new house we also look at things like

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:21,769
how to handle assigning these various

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:25,519
events so various classes oh its various

00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:31,100
vendors we stick to model having one

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:34,160
threat or bust work and we do what about

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,620
things like that voltage be potentially

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,939
that having multiple threads for

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:42,920
different types and how so website of

00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:47,499
that maybe there's burglars where it

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:53,449
mixes consolidates best on to be single

00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:56,029
David's been having dedicated every

00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:58,069
United States there's also

00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,459
considerations like you can analyze

00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:07,249
syntax for Emily's event loose finals

00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:09,680
against there's potential questions like

00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:14,459
whether or not it make sense

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:17,010
and those girly tennis considerations

00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:20,820
that motivated the development to

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:23,730
Moslems two contests is basically just

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:28,020
conduct and humanities that represents

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:31,470
exactly but promised object so you

00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:36,170
instantiate given ma'am i'm using cash

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:40,020
objects similar to things like for Iorg

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:43,890
of course do an election contest has

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:48,420
associated with it it's empty thread it

00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:51,870
also assigning ID to HQ context and

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:55,260
that's nice really a four point here is

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:59,040
that each human on test has a league ID

00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,950
and that ID that you need to pass costs

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,220
different devices that potentially have

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:09,630
events that the one off total to mention

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:13,350
contents so where things like able to

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:17,990
carry with me potentially have set up my

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:21,990
options may be an specify one or more

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:26,360
coupon sites that he buys a vengeance

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,360
too awkward each offense though

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:37,590
and that's that's the basic command line

00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:41,340
configuration or in context basically

00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:44,430
just instantiate the object given me by

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,990
E and there's also a record specify

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:51,480
whether or not we wanted to immediately

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:54,870
start up sadly it defaults yes the

00:12:51,480 --> 00:13:02,010
paucity buckhannon scarring stop ian

00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:06,710
event after effects using a qualm thanks

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:12,840
to avaya he had faces to interact with

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:18,300
automatic based on a system based on my

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:22,590
wall introspection and execute functions

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,350
is lacking access problems so in an

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:28,920
abortion to creating more than one human

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:35,760
context clearly we're using gene context

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:39,330
to pass an end to 27 going on according

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,820
to update acquaintance right on Motley

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,560
to claim in this case essentially table

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,410
you know that the idol process that

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:52,650
creates and attaches it too young to the

00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:55,410
contest I mean passivated another

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,170
important point is at least two concepts

00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:04,680
in driving sentence assess human sources

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:07,620
so like I mentioned earlier see Morgan

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:14,440
concepts that we can drive at source to

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:18,110
multiple licenses for Matins against

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:23,330
is a Chiefs first contest is actually a

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:25,930
small wraparound cheating on tests so to

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:31,850
associate event production concepts

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:35,750
you'll need the only main environment is

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:38,540
that able to provide that and then

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,760
squirts implemented Jesus and the gaze

00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:47,000
of the IO contest we already have that

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:50,420
much now that's a report abusive for

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
other types of devices i mentioned

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:57,040
earlier for the event data plane word

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,839
but a potentially fear act quickly

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,820
network backyards that have a common

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,810
sense with that sources Stephanie one

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:08,860
associated with W identity in the case

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:14,120
of tap devices from you know actually

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:16,580
use the Iowa context or cheese source of

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,800
about equal one to register the mental

00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:26,300
name actually is there a globalist p.m.

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:30,080
or is that the network that can be used

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,140
to register in cases like that there's

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:38,020
there's super bad or that twitchy source

00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,020
step and also offload in his events

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:50,740
that's just an example of consolidating

00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:50,740
multiple data planes aunt example

00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:03,579
another the last major feature of in

00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:10,250
context is that provides introspection

00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:12,860
by way of it being warm object so here

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:19,610
as mentioned earlier we have turkey

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:22,510
releases to this list properties

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:26,769
associated with an object to be done

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:30,320
it's an access properties Institute with

00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:36,980
an object and also to set problems here

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:41,540
they concede hundred objects

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:44,839
instantiating it up since ex1 that's the

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:47,620
true context item set out to try they

00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:53,000
don't get invited and there's also a

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:57,829
second jamel text message via the teen

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,800
vol Jin Hans stood the eye over it also

00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:02,630
has a dream concepts associated and

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,809
because of that we can actually also do

00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:11,839
things like David aitken friend you met

00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:15,530
back to me not sure what these pieces

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:22,329
all over that I know there's one

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:22,329
particular case migration where

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:30,620
it's like taking david lean thread

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,120
bridge that balances of a loop there

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:36,169
they're making some evidence iterations

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:46,850
there that day into a yahoo jism try to

00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:49,250
lose disabilities and second removal how

00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,679
about here is would be problems

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,630
associated with the others easiest one

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,940
to objects so there's no Frannie

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:04,399
spreaded tell me wonder how you got

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:07,580
started why is that problem to start

00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:10,240
stocking up two days I i was also you

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:15,260
hacking that associated with in creating

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:17,870
music Natalie you're gonna see spit out

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,409
in the red I mean of course always

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:24,830
between men who that's being driven by

00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:26,570
this particular convergence so in

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:33,100
committees these types of interfaces we

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:33,100
wanted two things I aimed at its

00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:43,220
and that's us basically it's far as king

00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:50,850
contents those it's very simple concept

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:52,769
it seems to be very flexible the rest of

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:59,299
this talk mainly about some of the

00:18:52,769 --> 00:19:06,029
additional burdens of the SAS hit films

00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:07,980
were cast and this is in an overview of

00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:11,159
all the men suppose it's currently

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,610
supported widening I over it this is it

00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:20,340
mr. set of me sources that you can drive

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:22,919
yellow not as I mentioned earlier AI

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,830
open on texts were driven by the matter

00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:33,409
with your knees mostly because of that

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:36,690
can already drive in a contest contest I

00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:42,629
also mentioned in other words introduced

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:46,440
cases my name is tackle Isis really

00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:48,870
maybe don't register those events with

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:55,070
amazing isn't resources have other

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:59,690
mechanisms to support those pecs penis

00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,690
this is worthless be done by our enemy

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:07,980
hi I never disappointed I'm focusing on

00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:11,730
parent portal back to the G sources

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:15,659
discredited or demon himself mentioned

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:22,110
derivatives a global list that we use to

00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:24,690
register FPS and so anglers refuse to

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,450
pour them into the Beast worse there's a

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:31,850
couple of protien second taken one of

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:36,960
them tried away longs to take everything

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:40,740
FP and gave up a cheese course page

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:47,789
raheem that again motivation for that

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:51,450
his own yeah locking mechanisms backward

00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:59,220
provided like 247 may be easier to deal

00:20:51,450 --> 00:21:02,909
with renovations on this ministry that's

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:10,640
what approach pizza it's very wrong for

00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:16,820
us or rusting cigarette Dean and my

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:21,539
mother in search the average that he and

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:27,600
in the case of driving most minute with

00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:32,640
netbeans get resources haha he handle it

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:37,770
would have to be basically the queries

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,809
you lived on Jesus and one of them to

00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:43,770
levis is an employment nice antagonism

00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:47,340
student do things like associated Jesus

00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:55,279
mercifully see how to do some syntactic

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:57,840
any state the finite resource based on

00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:00,090
the other issue is that cheese course

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,039
does he look up through all of us

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,500
resources at any time you use when you

00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:07,490
are doing business so here are the

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:13,190
situation would frequently trying to

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:19,770
handle it you can spend a lot of time

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:24,419
searching for within the last so the

00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:28,049
emotions with the entire odorless and

00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:31,679
move that to the singles and that was up

00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:36,770
really well but there are some don't

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:39,690
issues that rise the contest composites

00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:44,010
anyone be pathetic you can no longer

00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:47,510
rely on all these Bennett registration

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:52,320
emotions being run under the rule it s

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:57,360
not now count with that that you

00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:01,350
registered the cameras for to give a

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,560
deep we could have said it better as

00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:07,190
trying to access that we're doing those

00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,890
modifications we wanted to us

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:15,450
renovations Ashley then and interests

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:24,480
and Victor's there's a lot of parishes

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:27,140
that I considered to do things and the

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,560
initial ones was the obvious one between

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:36,600
human up the introduced some intense

00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:40,380
protects the list of the feeds while on

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:49,050
the anatomy businesses and then we make

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:52,190
sure we acquire a lock by our suits and

00:23:49,050 --> 00:24:00,150
that we would be sure that rolling along

00:23:52,190 --> 00:24:04,800
that's also access initially run into

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:08,760
there is that often times you actually

00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:13,050
then handle it what your daddy will

00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:18,930
actually walk by itself so what's up

00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:22,170
here we pass rate for dispatch hence com

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:25,380
app or the FT connect men call that and

00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:37,400
it's a friend's mom because of that

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:37,400
potential own to take this deadlock

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:47,580
the knee-jerk reaction is when something

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:51,300
like recursively text that I was told

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:55,920
it's not great let's get that approach

00:24:51,300 --> 00:25:02,520
and I am into looking at different

00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:05,550
variations of how to keep diploma how to

00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:11,340
do this right away and they all boil

00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:16,850
down to the same fundamental restriction

00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:21,210
that is that when you register an event

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:24,420
for a particular epi you cannot hold any

00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:27,600
law that might potentially that can

00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:38,040
potentially dated by one of the better

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:41,130
asks complexed a little bit a lot of use

00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:45,660
aces that we tend to want to be able to

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:50,930
support for instance in the case of eggs

00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:56,850
like you know the net I'm back end is

00:25:50,930 --> 00:26:01,170
proof of a real that you attend think

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:04,680
that make that make that a reasonable

00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:08,370
levels old memory red blue implement

00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:10,910
some time ago you test to protect stay

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,840
actually actively attacking us and

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,990
whenever they did work on that's

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,750
appetizing day that long and given the

00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,210
process including a coordinated to

00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:25,580
autopilot leave at the associated that's

00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:32,220
atomized do is equal to unlock all we

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:35,520
all things like 7pm but it also have

00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:38,250
even a step generally in the context of

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,530
n call back the first thing we'll do it

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:44,770
or it them all back then it's require

00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:49,900
that you

00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:54,680
in that situation even in the use of

00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:57,560
recursive mechanism like cheating

00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:02,840
context apartment you can still run into

00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:07,730
something akin to deadlock and that's

00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:11,930
because this reticence if you take the

00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:15,350
loss on on the left side we're holding a

00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:17,980
lot he intensive requirement if you for

00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,980
attempting to acquire

00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:36,510
okay well Anthony different situation if

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,900
we need to take the mutex and you what

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:44,450
were able to the wire I remember

00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:48,740
acquires the United dispatch function

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:52,410
provision concentrated benetton wires

00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:55,800
contest before us then it attempts to

00:27:52,410 --> 00:28:03,540
block you know mute export a place as

00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:05,070
part of a meaningful when I was we're

00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,340
going to end up antenna for this block

00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:13,980
whole district and this leads them to be

00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:18,240
able to be wired up it's not going to be

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:21,110
able to successfully college in that

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:26,010
situation pretty much any type of

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:28,140
automata end up a situation i have

00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:39,860
looked at some horses implementations

00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:42,060
and pasta is similar but at some point I

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,780
started considering what her office was

00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:49,350
being really it was a scenario where he

00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:52,800
had this teacher you have a queue

00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:55,830
context bread it's constantly contending

00:28:52,800 --> 00:29:00,450
with some other rabbits trying to access

00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:05,250
yeah means that people off lolita netqin

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:08,340
motives the main goal off limits events

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:11,600
is that those Mexican Asian American

00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:14,550
context independently of any other code

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:19,050
we have situational captions read that

00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:23,190
article by Texas most one other there's

00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:28,380
probably an amazing case that community

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:32,240
for either booming those losses that

00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:34,880
code together to school in context for

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,030
cash just stand that doesn't make sense

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,030
of it

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:47,490
so digging that your things other

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:53,260
options not a little learning about hey

00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:56,170
are you met registration fencing seeing

00:29:53,260 --> 00:30:03,150
the senior bible so if we do things like

00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:08,070
it instead of trying to register dings

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:13,150
an atomic mass we can defer registration

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:15,970
BF in masks are provided by plate a

00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:21,270
little tips every two contests is

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:21,270
capable of having a bottom half

00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:27,820
interviews that magnetism say I has

00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:32,050
through events that i want offloads

00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:34,420
presented been to seven colleges patch

00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:39,010
that up with a structure that we didn't

00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:45,730
pass into that Wow a few things not

00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:55,800
actually we don't actually Wow off by

00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:55,800
looking at my students

00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:06,050
that's cuz its kind of release down Oh

00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:10,720
today started with looking at using this

00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:10,720
mechanism of variation a bomb-ass

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:22,600
dealing with this scenario initiations

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,600
the major hole here so don't hear it's

00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:32,930
actually fairly soon that support not

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:35,980
only offering best creative and to get

00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:44,150
at the idol contest also events

00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:49,580
currently registered all i have is there

00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:52,340
any questions Oh have you considered

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,590
using me I see you both at that list but

00:31:52,340 --> 00:32:04,850
as lithium a new tradition it was

00:31:54,590 --> 00:32:11,510
endless just an awesome real good so we

00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:15,070
so that that works pretty well until you

00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,070
get into a situation where

00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:27,759
well let me just just kind of watching

00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:31,989
the road just what what I one of the

00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:34,059
nice things about the main loop is that

00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:37,419
we basically have fun being creative

00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:41,049
session include is widely that list

00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:42,789
that's the synchronization and any other

00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:47,399
accesses for the meeting from

00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:53,259
abominators one of modifying events

00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:55,449
running in that Hannibal so in that case

00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:58,959
it was about leaders if they want that

00:32:55,449 --> 00:33:01,779
day to be done atomically it would be

00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:04,329
updated calls tonight are skewed and

00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:06,849
once that's remember to return that

00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:08,999
polish because one of the things I was

00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:15,269
trying to avoid it's a situation where

00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:19,709
we have stale around mrs. in use because

00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:24,729
in some cases yeah straight murder

00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:27,879
modified event by burrito deleting event

00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:31,509
by partial all the animals cold and as a

00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:37,089
musical to that prior to leading some

00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:42,219
big data structure that is registered to

00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:44,829
one behind them so if they're still stay

00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:47,709
learns that I met ground potentially you

00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:51,339
access it end up with up he was out

00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:54,129
everything that's put us you what are

00:33:51,339 --> 00:34:01,539
the tricky the light brings up to you

00:33:54,129 --> 00:34:09,009
other players right and it doesn't

00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:12,700
matter itself yeah I mean every if we

00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:15,099
were able to deal with a season it's not

00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,609
based in general we could do something

00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:17,609
like ice cream

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,520
this

00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:10,360
yeah yes it's not as an option in some

00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:14,110
nah i mentioned educational needing to

00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:18,190
draw all of the rocks prior to trying to

00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:20,980
modify and handler that potentially

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:25,200
choir are those blocks the other edge to

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:27,610
that is to take in acquisition of that

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:43,090
prior to taking stocks and that's that's

00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:45,960
not a magician that happen but her to

00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,960
even about I

00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:11,380
right so that matter has none of the

00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:14,230
head it's kind of taking an academic

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,630
approach here where instead of really

00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:20,650
looking closely at when we need to wild

00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:23,830
locks just take a kind of a bulletproof

00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:53,890
approach where we always look to have to

00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:58,300
create so much bratz babyz another yeah

00:37:53,890 --> 00:38:00,910
yeah and I'm going to see that Matt Matt

00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:03,160
what's up no kind of some of that the

00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:07,330
approaches a connection but also the

00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:13,470
idea of different registration so I'm

00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:13,470
how much better approach yeah

00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:25,680
any other questions any time you want to

00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:29,460
stay I think we're in danger if we have

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,650
these different event locations if you

00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,590
are running the end result in the same

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:37,020
problem both comments it's almost weekly

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:39,510
wonder whether you really quite hard to

00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,360
try and beautifies just wanted them to

00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:44,400
yeah it's also he's pumped and again I'm

00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,950
incidence of the power and greens the

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,970
subject come on who's doing the bottom

00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:52,920
half strand say we killed a lot because

00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:55,470
they had work on their stuff that's made

00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,380
a mock players or sibling it's more of a

00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:01,590
general to depend already registered FPS

00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:03,600
all bodies but then we've got a whole

00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,190
other later kiss if we go to event loop

00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:09,270
that you talking about plus we've got

00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:11,070
the genie event open G schools and in

00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:13,260
each one of these cases we need to solve

00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,240
writing poems so they could you just you

00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:21,270
can plug this back loops I'll have

00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:24,570
somebody yeah I mean I I didn't mention

00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:27,020
didn't talk with these your motor

00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:30,630
learning at is a basically take every

00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:33,960
every defense was that you register yes

00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:36,690
guy really and where that twitchy source

00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:42,800
so that you can use to not text to try

00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:46,350
yellow hair long I elephants only other

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,590
the other Road not sure about keeping it

00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:55,550
honest please for much now the chemistry

00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:58,160
kind of contest yeah I related puns

00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:01,650
that's right most familiar with how just

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:08,990
use a credit because it's basically what

00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:13,200
the mobile phase missing here is there's

00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:17,820
the big spiders up so matters okay now

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,000
we're just that's forever but and the

00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,270
key

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,940
and then jamiah Pierre context just

00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:29,980
candidates or still tragedies and Jesus

00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:33,340
so there's a contractor Christian

00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:36,430
sources yeah i mean i'm not sure what

00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,620
the advantage of resource needs is to be

00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:45,160
order to get out and use the baggage of

00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:50,350
types of time but we said que si means

00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:52,750
or this is me as I care your class think

00:40:50,350 --> 00:41:01,750
with your mom but we should just discuss

00:40:52,750 --> 00:41:03,870
it with that you're the reference it's a

00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,870
