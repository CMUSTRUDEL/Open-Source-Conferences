Description: 
	Full name:  Keynote Panel: OVA at KVM Forum: Connecting High Performance End Users with Leading KVM Developers - Will Auld, Intel; Fernando Luis Vazquez Cao, NTT Open Software Center; Patrick Fitzgerald, i-Layer; Adam Jollans, IBM (Moderator)


As KVM is increasingly adopted by businesses and other organizations for virtualization, there is real value in bringing together high performance end users with the leading KVM community developers.

This panel of KVM end users aims to encourage these conversations by sharing experience of KVM practical deployments, identifying KVM technical needs, and discussing how developers and end users can work together to help make KVM better.

Moderated by the Open Virtualization Alliance, this session will also explore how best to enable cutting-edge end users to network together and with the development community.

but i'm here today on behalf of the

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,980
other virtualization lines are

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,130
answer that consortium about 20 50

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,190
companies look it's how we provokes kvm

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,850
over other virtualization technologies

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:21,270
and on monday this week the linux

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,939
foundation announced that the ova was

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,490
joining this plantation as collaborative

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,769
projects so existence is going to help

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,399
her Liggins much better to the ecosystem

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:37,110
to add that a person to up to the next

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,750
what we wanted to do today was start the

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,870
process in terms of up including the

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,030
connection between users and felons

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,920
between the leading edges as the users

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,280
are who are doing interesting things

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,649
with that with kvm the early adopters

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,640
who are there for getting the challenges

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:59,280
and learning and bezel getting started

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,050
dialogue going and so what's the

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,930
experience in terms of premium

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,500
deployments um one of the key technical

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,720
needs their fighting at the moment and

00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,610
howie as we move forward because we get

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,760
this communication and this interchange

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,610
going so we're going to invite onto the

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,130
stage as we panel members so ab dope a

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:28,740
chicken will you've got some car to the

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:32,460
stage please i will start with a sort of

just an animal small they're doing ask a

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,860
few questions of that and then we'll

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,290
open up to questions of walking up I

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,420
know this audience is it will strike out

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,689
are some questions or things that people

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,570
ask questions so there's one one mic on

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,720
their server so if we understand so I

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,210
just like to ask her on the Fernando dis

get up okay so man is another word for

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:36,440
inky's allosaurs solar center as an

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,470
attending a little operating systems

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,910
team the only source over Center

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,769
provides some more consulting our R&D

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,610
services do all the ATP per vendor

00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:53,480
companies so I mean whenever an entity

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:56,840
you know the company wants to do

00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,080
something with open sores or que bien

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,870
cachonda they will come to us so I have

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,019
a pretty big you no idea what's going on

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:09,019
inside entity and this day is very

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:13,880
trying to move all on our you know

00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:16,370
legacy clouds which were built using you

00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,160
know much business tax act on our build

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,739
you know 15 house and trying to move to

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,019
topic which is amorous toddler something

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,579
I did all the stack so that we can get

00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:27,680
some help from the community and you

00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:31,640
know how to do everything ourselves well

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,670
together with the naughty house problem

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,410
you know as we're driving things and I

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,780
would like to say that I mean these days

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,049
pick your body such as entity data and

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:46,130
19 cases are starting to deploy really

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:48,410
heavy and based on the clouds and well

00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,630
there's some problem with that and well

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,570
and we get for this opportunity to share

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,780
our experience with you i will talk

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,970
about that later ok let's do lunch then

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:07,819
on to a patrick as its jelly from the

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:12,200
pilot yeah there's a london-based some

00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:20,530
of us for business we have the point of

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:24,820
a 505 is a fantastic cloud to be

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,820
gradually but as

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:37,539
home master so early a novel is one of

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:44,229
them we started crying start accusing

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:50,069
anyone just a compromise using it on

00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:54,969
every sensible controlling song before

00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:57,009
heading outside ok that's remember that

00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:59,590
all too well a little bit sort of a

00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:03,479
mixture of this really is a perspective

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:06,930
of discipline a job it's fun for all and

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:11,650
working human source technology said

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:17,020
specifically yeah virtualization energy

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:23,110
and what we do is extend and in a nice

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:29,770
area and also for Lisa's new Burkhardt

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:33,669
and stack you're like I'm kind of

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:38,740
looking from the evolver side you to try

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:43,599
to enhance the user experience versatile

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:46,000
kvm and also just as a stack okay thanks

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:48,159
very much so I'm starting with the

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,110
hypervisor and I'm going you so to speak

00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,240
about boxer what it feels good about

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,490
okay the pipeline's of what's up what if

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,650
anything is missing page so i mean i'm

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,770
going to say about these days otherwise

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:03,370
work a PM is really good I mean both

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:06,610
performance wise and SW is 72 not I

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,919
think it's the best that you can get of

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,129
course I mean in the only days is what

00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:15,279
about that Rosie I remember don't have a

00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:17,830
lot of you know emulation Harbor

00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,069
demolition issues and God emulation each

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,469
years and the significant part of me

00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:25,930
know the bats from our que dia

00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:29,229
deployments were related to either

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,930
Acadian or Kimmy but again I mean that's

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:34,390
not the case these days these days

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,860
you're kidding yes rough side and

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,800
that's something it's a part of us

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,840
another window mean or about anymore but

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,530
on the other hand our wrongs are moving

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,300
both starve and sideways I mean kidding

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,110
me isolation is used with you need

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:54,910
networking storage management of work

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:59,020
etc mainly BD two examples our two years

00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:01,480
ago and then I Team B support was added

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,430
to the linens breach we were really

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,370
excited about that because food worried

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:10,570
that was great for our podcast for those

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:13,000
and so we are totally devoid it you know

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,640
in production but after a few days we

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,980
found out you know the network would go

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,830
silent they reach the stuff you know

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,500
forwarding packets our grandmothers were

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,050
not happy about it and the problem was

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,570
that wasn't really nasty diving into a

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,030
TMP code and since we were early

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:34,090
adopters we have to fix whole thing

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:37,360
ourselves getting nurse upstream then we

00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:39,430
have to convince our enterprises through

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,570
you don't provider in urbana sort of our

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:46,290
parties to the enterprise colonel so

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:50,440
what's a mess you know but well and

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:52,620
another example is the deal on some one

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,850
codon was added to the name is Colonel

00:07:52,620 --> 00:08:01,150
earlier this year and since we are early

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,730
adopters always it up will we enjoyed to

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:07,270
risky things we have show you the body

00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:09,010
in production and we realized and when

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,310
you 20 tracks and you know for example

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:14,700
tank pockets and pockets even taneously

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:18,370
through the same order things will bring

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:21,700
so there's three weeks we've been fixing

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,520
the pill encode and after the last week

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,560
they never maintainer at our watches and

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,140
now I have two convenience priest but

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,820
what I rushed for our own personal

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:36,880
smiling sun is so what I'm trying to say

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,310
that kami and have a personal problem

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,990
anymore and we need to do a better job

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:46,600
on testing them the house back not just

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,750
also you know que quieres para dos

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,580
carros opening Test against our property

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,440
management is talking do QA for the

00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,290
whole thing of just the habit of ice

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,230
cream ok interruption actually who's

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:03,370
been a new experience very similar maybe

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:08,560
a guide so as a technologist fantastic

00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:11,610
chuckles at all it is the management

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,970
software that links needs the attachment

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:18,130
we had a similar problem from enough

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:22,060
whatever one of our clients or their

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:25,390
networking going so but that was quite

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:30,430
strangely they're using it must serve

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:32,700
again later and give had a similar

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,680
problem when we had a convert all their

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:40,480
systems or a bunch of assistance right

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:46,140
side on the network and I really really

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:50,770
have to get the men is always really

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:55,710
concern us it's not much of a choice of

00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:58,660
sweetening that and which is normal for

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:04,060
this also volatile weather between

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:05,710
versions to get interesting results to

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,560
try important together on it worth

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:12,010
trying to control one version for matter

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:20,110
i would get officiated people that are

00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:27,000
also swim it had came in itself is part

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:32,200
and also features in the attitude so

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:37,450
what we do okay okay attention i will

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:42,730
also go to experience totally and man i

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:47,050
think many aquatic think so my face is

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:50,650
just in time we're bringing up some you

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:54,150
see our virtual whites broken totally

00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,150
it's a little bit

00:10:54,769 --> 00:11:03,899
shade yeah I I find interesting that

00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:14,100
it's very stable stuff seems like it's

00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:15,720
not stable at all any conceit to that is

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,699
where you see the instability oh it's

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,819
just busy guys be bushed that's a few

00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:23,610
versions certainly in things like the

00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:36,739
mystic virtualization you know that's a

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:40,470
real holiday support is not that yeah

00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:44,730
that's were think of a newer features

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:50,429
places herb have just introduced in the

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:51,959
futures modernization ok so we're

00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:53,399
thinkin to have just been going to the

00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,899
hypervisor before we move on to other

00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,230
deep discussion on virtualization

00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,319
management couple of the items that have

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,199
come before our vans latency and grant

00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:08,639
high variability and and only nice or

00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:12,209
comments on those which you mentioned

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,639
early lindsey is okay usually the

00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:18,049
rendering that is the specificity like

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:21,689
nitrogen especially stories migration

00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:26,149
our customers found out of the latency

00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:29,970
is not a constant and the restore the

00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:32,699
some of our customers internal customers

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,819
i mean we're using all the

00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:38,759
implementation of the storage migration

00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:43,199
which had well which has emissions you

00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:44,840
know as well as and so thin that give me

00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:49,010
mr. migration

00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:52,910
try to ping their guests or something no

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:55,370
other guests and the case was just was

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,050
like the silent good going to freeze you

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,950
know that this is one of you schedule

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:03,140
because we were running home side

00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,810
comedian instead of running against code

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:09,530
so some of our enterprise customers

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:13,000
really need some constant ladies even

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:16,820
during by vibration and well after that

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,460
technically that's not that's not easy

00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,230
to do actually I think and regarding

00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,050
that issue don't like to hear from you

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:27,380
know for the front you guys for the

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,900
developers I mean for a second was kind

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,990
of okay I told them to use a different

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,810
need additional storage migration even

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:39,080
with the implementation legacy is not

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,780
constant but in my twin I told about

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,270
that something absolutely and in what I

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:50,000
really have seen the same issues

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:53,450
runnable the RF of the guys working for

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:59,120
you know for history so they won her

00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:03,080
team some other so Yemeni proposal to

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,920
this fix that blanking you click your

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:09,530
body and also provided a che we haven't

00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:13,910
went to be a changing and arrange a

00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:19,070
solutions based on pacemaker and Harvick

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:22,040
and it's been evolving house on this

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:25,070
color itself and we are very happy with

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,680
it some of our own issued its learning

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:31,310
to like vibration and how the gas

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,460
behaves you like favorite hey actually

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:37,340
observe the unit's very lazy we don't do

00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,710
any storage moderation but it's a lot of

00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:43,970
aggression is Lewis column what I've

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:47,090
experienced said but doesn't seem to be

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:53,620
in a row awaiting trial if we said this

00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:53,620
is up and we hope the operation

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:02,600
it's for a relevant so it's not really

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,019
much much mini impossible doesn't work

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:10,759
and that's my time longer than other

00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:13,399
products some hospital for this and

00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:18,399
we'll using anything come to you testing

00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:21,500
on AIDS and it this is like a crazy

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:26,569
anime added some issues today but the

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:31,699
issues here the latency transfer a lot

00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:37,540
of that is workbook and but across stuff

00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:40,720
now I wonder if their nurses were

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,000
experiencing a cheaper places maybe

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:48,850
maybe not as good lazy by the organ

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,480
system it up upcycling given slope

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:55,940
ellipses kosta dozen of them I don't

00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:07,360
know I don't have a proposed it there it

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:10,069
seems like that ok so the living on to

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,370
virtualization management could you

00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:16,279
speak to sort of having a of doing the

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,959
citation the act what you've done

00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,720
yourself watching you use into the open

00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:23,750
source propellers what we get Rebecca

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:29,420
going so being frontier and we know

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:31,819
everything house and moving k animals

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,250
from day one and we were not using

00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:38,000
Bieber we're talking to the hyperbaric

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:41,449
therapy but we soon found out on a bus

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,279
in scale we did I mean we cannot do

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:46,519
everything ourselves so we started to

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,699
use the only perv and these days you're

00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:54,199
most dreaming meaning i think many of us

00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:55,660
whose images of stock-based but my thing

00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:58,750
is that i vs conor

00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,880
between the Clarion Community the

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,850
diverse community in the hall activity

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,060
for example I wisconsin was storage

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:11,410
migration but they've been using the

00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:14,620
wrong api from I mean for a long time

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:17,580
the reason they all additional storage

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:20,650
hydration which is not a big problem

00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:23,500
which of Acadian developers know about

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,840
and marcello panneti something which is

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,140
much better block jobs the head of staff

00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:32,290
and you wanted to use that but the thing

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,610
the problem is not with with you know

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,940
the office language so that we were

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:40,480
using and the right version of the bird

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:43,570
was not even do not ship and so I think

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:48,400
it would be nice if you know that Kyle

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:50,680
guys guys guys guys from each other you

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,520
know more often so that you have guys in

00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:57,520
knowing what in case they should use

00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:01,600
nothing as a community to do a better

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,120
job of telling our users for the eyes

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,010
are stable what I guess are supposed to

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,100
be used which ones are hard to be

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:12,700
dedicated so that you know so that it

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,680
covers know what you used so the other

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,970
days since we were drinkin inhales mean

00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,490
you know how they can appreciate but

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,650
when we try to east coast at realize

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:25,120
some reason we're using the roamers

00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:28,630
burke or i'd only cutely libraries are

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:32,310
running a huge and that's why we have to

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:35,550
be happy I mean in our own you know

00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:38,410
fixes for all start happening features

00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:42,520
so we actually like to take something

00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:45,850
from Susie are with her you know instead

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,100
of between our own mortgage tax so that

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:50,020
I probably include the communication

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,350
between kvn thousand means you get

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:58,090
inside without impunity selected on the

00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:00,970
other racers singing waiter I said you

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:03,440
don't know myself and we should put more

00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:07,379
meaning you see that she's not

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:11,489
reno's nice here in standard answer via

00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:13,769
what's going on I mean tell Eleanor

00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:18,570
teach me how to use I mean what a

00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:20,159
community in spider that's patrica what

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,159
you all would he do to virtualization

00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:30,659
management as i said former because in

00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:34,159
the other parent that that hasn't

00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:39,599
problems of the scale obvious reasons

00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:43,409
the main column we've had is when we

00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,149
lose control of the dirt and can be

00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:47,099
quite difficult to restart with that

00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:49,039
situation toilet two men i hope you

00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:52,679
couldn't get control that in the end

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:55,710
shadows on the side and when we let the

00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:58,440
single server migration hospitals either

00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:05,519
my vibration possible talks through do

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:09,089
better anyway so and that was the latest

00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,859
version if you stress so the single easy

00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:13,109
problems with liver and which is

00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:17,389
interesting it wasn't sensible all the

00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:20,729
major software is focused around develop

00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:25,369
so different asking absolutely spot-on

00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:29,309
at work very well there is no solid wood

00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:33,479
so we were considering owner are

00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:36,389
measured solution and promise with 11

00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:39,809
states and one mystery science airline

00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:45,979
and realized he associated press the

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:49,649
gods were based anything wrong you're

00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:55,919
always wanted to get actually write

00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:58,799
about it together like so never happen

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:05,969
either he's actually people in the

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:08,820
different versions as odd man during we

00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:09,820
had a conscience difference is from

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,910
space

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:17,430
and she just dissed old spice route 43

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:22,180
and Australia manager yuan from Jana

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:26,440
hospital yet again the ESD started the

00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:28,330
proviso it was a different post the

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:32,860
schedule erroneously for the most in one

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:35,470
expected but click on the terminal one

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,870
cannot host community for medicine so

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:42,310
there's some communication is going on

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:45,010
this cherished that this is as a product

00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,660
that's not good and then there's gotta

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:51,730
be some sort of another head lodger

00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:57,600
there is not a pest part but they truly

00:21:51,730 --> 00:22:00,580
do this by whatever extension of savings

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,140
editor and some will let any sort of

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:06,400
Tesla's virtualization management

00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:12,340
doesn't actually know you just a little

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:16,320
death and which is because as that's

00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:18,850
opera a little trying to fix and you

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,060
yeah layers in there anything can see

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,610
refer to strangle okay so and just know

00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:31,900
recently where we've started you some

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:33,490
rest at work yeah so let's dump time

00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,910
enough to see if there's any any

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,920
comments or questions from the floor

00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,310
this day to go to a very big mike with

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,140
taught over there anyone much making me

00:22:42,310 --> 00:23:01,240
for the comments or questions to the

00:22:44,140 --> 00:23:06,970
stage pressure there anyway well what is

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:10,290
that using a what prompted solely as a

00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,290
prelude version

00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:18,119
we were pleasantly calloused ok so the

00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:22,159
thing is that it varies in our favor or

00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:26,340
focused at which is also dentist forcing

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:28,080
awesome this is not good person and

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,129
never in recent policy is not really

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:36,690
something earlier levels to what this

00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:40,679
good so if you want to know how we come

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:45,539
to migrate from the new as a disco of

00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:49,590
men okay bye mr. okay so simple mr.

00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:52,739
McMullin was the only Easter that was

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:56,580
you know building practice for almost at

00:23:52,739 --> 00:24:01,289
so we started with of hypnotism who the

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:05,099
best valid like we were like to have

00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:08,249
also a real flavor of opens taxable so

00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:11,369
that we are stuck with you you know we

00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:13,409
are not tied to particular you know

00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:16,259
disturb but that's not good for SEO and

00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:19,379
some of our customers prefer a lot of

00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:20,960
our customers prefer to its after our

00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:23,609
customers so we want to provide a

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,179
proposition for all of them so we're

00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:28,109
going now into our current you know

00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:30,419
implementation so we like to have

00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:34,019
different flavors let's say to the

00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:36,570
flavor well flavor of the fiber and it's

00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:40,799
a two hour it's a customer you know what

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:51,299
the cheese you know they always that mr.

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:55,139
that he or she first and attribution

00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:58,109
issue between that dear okay so yeah I

00:24:55,139 --> 00:25:02,039
mean it doesn't is a discussion about to

00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:06,090
always take these throws and one of this

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:10,669
rather variance then ok let's see that

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:13,499
Amina we suck sleep on the element in

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:16,859
the tea flavor so we access only started

00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:19,149
we have good job ecstatic relevance time

00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:21,820
and we wanted to talk

00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:25,610
that's a really big eating these days in

00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:29,210
for starters then for example wanted for

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:32,120
messaging uses right thank you but we're

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,309
absolutely delicious qpa so they don't

00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,129
they can help each other so you end up

00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:40,850
having to you know create different

00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:44,059
availability songs right so you have to

00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:47,240
modify the front and management software

00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:49,309
the money you know the better it is not

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,629
differently and that's a lot of work for

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:56,299
us it also as a community and angry

00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:57,559
should have a bishop I mean talk more to

00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:00,259
each other and we should be more

00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,779
commonality between different you know

00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:05,629
almost a prestressed it's like leaving

00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:08,809
sisters you know in the other days I'm

00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:10,909
not even today I mean we have mr. wkd

00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:13,129
each other's unity others using there

00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:15,710
are three and same is happening rated

00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:18,080
value and I think that's a shame I don't

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,929
you know I mean those are muscles

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,990
properly and try them something about it

00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:26,929
I don't love we can I mean a medium up

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:29,059
oh because I'm is not even much it's not

00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:30,889
a much better product I mean you can use

00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:33,080
it it's like I mean really it's like a

00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:35,590
toy if you think or words Australia time

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,990
use it in production for our screen I

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:41,299
mean you have to do lot of external

00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:44,480
government fix a lot of us who you love

00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:46,850
QA slow work so what is the theory and

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,070
yeah I think we have a really good

00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:54,049
opportunity try to give any drive in

00:26:49,070 --> 00:27:01,070
from before it's too late that's right

00:26:54,049 --> 00:27:03,619
we saw on account of time and that's bad

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:08,019
news for our experience so we start off

00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:13,480
with you go to a distribution tsx build

00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:13,480
powerful source you know probably narrow

00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:22,850
butt over to change my expenses we

00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:27,260
explore about

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:31,400
this capital i'm holding a stack vision

00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:39,800
but not too useful in business with so

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:41,930
it's just now in our eyes estately whoo

00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:47,510
for us that's just a development package

00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:50,000
that needs acostada distress any things

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:52,490
will follow mr. something you so any

00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:03,770
other questions of the stage remove on

00:27:52,490 --> 00:28:15,440
the loop it's one from my Chris hit so

00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:18,410
Patrick first of all your old man to try

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:23,150
a new over project it's sort of a middle

00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:25,490
ground between the insanity of a future

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:28,340
project like a Holy Sacrament complex we

00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:34,390
have set up and the madness of usage

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:39,410
Burt manager in the proper price as you

00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:42,380
can see look Adam shut out some no I

00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:45,560
haven't because I've been thinking a lot

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:50,750
of stuff was the teacher / get to a

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:54,890
point with we thought I was dying but it

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:58,280
wants to look without his dad uncle

00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:02,900
toilet no it is total line around very

00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:05,000
much so given an animal told about other

00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:10,310
side by infusion we are not moving tools

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:14,510
that they comply seen hundreds more

00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:17,830
problems holly is for me either tomorrow

00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:23,900
or Miss nomer miss tatianna

00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:30,470
fetch me there's no time I was accosted

00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:36,440
you know so yeah and then a comment

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:39,380
grandma this is sort of a very sensitive

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,290
to oranges us ki madad I'm are

00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,300
interesting and even bought these Clues

00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,950
kind of grew some of those gaps we've

00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:50,300
seen the same thing specialist with that

00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:53,750
involved in 700 why choosing a

00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:56,510
particular way too damaged gigan that's

00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,850
just sort of the internals of one is

00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,910
grow it's not the community-wide and one

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:05,330
of the goals of giving warmest improve

00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:06,770
and also those those bridges and we

00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,700
actually trying to difficulty getting

00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:15,800
the located about interest in the higher

00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:17,810
level engine ways so I thought leader to

00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,310
the gruyère it already is the thought

00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:26,210
that having a group of communication has

00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:30,770
certainly stop there before bridge those

00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:38,060
gaps thanks any other question to the

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:39,740
stage he was eluted hey so taking big

00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,480
day to enjoy the sandwich what what are

00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,640
you looking for I'm in the Sacko hey

00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:50,630
they have to be able to prepare for what

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:53,870
you have nothing so for our case will be

00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:56,600
a proverb no biting a purchase order

00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:59,480
we're done here we have their centers

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:05,000
all over again I'm not only am all over

00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:08,450
the world so mean for us vibration on

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,820
scheme is really important so some

00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:14,150
battery unit i'm running a robot bouncer

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:17,750
in the each of you has a different last

00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:21,260
front after nominate an additional it's

00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:24,020
crazy and what I've our own but we have

00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:27,650
two implementations and what we're

00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,300
trying to you know converse 21 i'm at

00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,510
like

00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,310
which is standard which is a strength no

00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,470
but we know we need is proper

00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:39,310
construction supporting style is that

00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:42,730
which status on provide I mean when you

00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:44,800
send it but I cubic message you're

00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,870
running cute message and something

00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,530
critics you can either look like and

00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:54,070
since you're a career we are gonna live

00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:57,730
on the freaks we are a transaction

00:31:54,070 --> 00:32:01,360
supported OpenStack hopefully to makes

00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:03,640
people will be proposing something to

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,240
the vault immunity granted of this

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:09,990
happening hometown is the warranty so

00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:14,620
neither as a courier we have some

00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:16,930
departments of maybe most people you

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,570
know Scott Eyre don't really care about

00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:23,140
alucard Larissa care about this path of

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:26,820
every little specific sdn an argument we

00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:31,420
needed political Morton's any less work

00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:36,100
we support on a string not was not phony

00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:39,340
ass now it's part of toast and error so

00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,490
we have to find someone to either

00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:45,820
provide any less important for us we're

00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,800
all so much ourselves and now they're

00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:52,780
trying to music how we need to become

00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:58,480
artists but focus on mpls um you can

00:32:52,780 --> 00:33:02,320
apply metal gear doesn't in him just so

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,870
in our use case is maybe to you know

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,700
Kyra specifically so many something I

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:12,640
steer no can write it I just develop and

00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,860
center Patrick if you say you go towards

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:23,520
i could start i want you to looking for

00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:28,870
that by just automatic works of art

00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:33,130
youjizz program front hand loading in

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:37,630
forms by the ice over the soul service

00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:39,180
to our customers and one moderation is

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:42,910
quite basic or

00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,860
but this interesting knows that means

00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:49,090
driving the same problems yet we have

00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:54,970
and I got it just stuck it was also

00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:58,150
interesting that the my scalp we as a

00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:02,380
couple of dozen serves you focus balance

00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:04,990
so we're having the same problem it is

00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:09,760
an indication that there's a there's a

00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:14,050
problem Marcus day and in anyone's

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:20,140
origin to 1300 years so thick and the

00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:23,590
things like that such as what as a

00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:29,710
consumer of virtualization account I

00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:32,890
can't see the need for that isn't what I

00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:34,450
think so will lady wants to a comment on

00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:36,960
what you see the possible use cases

00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:40,870
mastered version i don't agree with and

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:45,250
yes the nested virtualization yeah you

00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:47,200
know actually here if you want to move

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,880
something from today's hair and it's

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:56,620
already virtualized into the cloud

00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:59,620
definitely loud person that was so

00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:03,400
that's one thing and if you do anything

00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:10,600
with clients with clients about those

00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:14,380
clients might use the first well

00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:17,950
honoring the desktop doing a version

00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:24,150
while they in my own in all have nested

00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:28,180
case as well so those are two basic on

00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:30,070
the live migration through you what

00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:34,360
what's the easiest bomb you said load

00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:40,510
balancing it's a host no problem only

00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:44,290
that agent under another latest so

00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:47,190
sometimes you know after it comes you

00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:49,950
want to migrate at all the data center

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:55,319
as a result you outside somewhere else

00:35:49,950 --> 00:36:00,990
so that the other eurozone is away a

00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:04,920
year please welcome there's one every

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:08,640
way or fashion or volcano whatever

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,190
something happens someone who the

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,680
government is not ready squish that you

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,260
know effort in want us to be able t

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:21,359
matter how they use an atrocity really

00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:24,540
bad officer okay takes around final

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,910
question today over to Adam what do you

00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,910
think we could do either take it for

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:32,880
those guys a smart or community example

00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:36,440
to sort of have get a more communication

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,829
between leading at abusers and epidermis

00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:43,650
that I make your nose with a star I

00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:46,349
think I mean by more users also the

00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:50,630
openstack guys in the middle burgers are

00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:54,510
run here be nice morning from you know

00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:59,010
OpenStack also more people from come on

00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:00,900
developers on employment you mean nice

00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:04,140
how are the stakeholders I mean look

00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,420
better and any just for one day and

00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,390
espero got something maybe they only
