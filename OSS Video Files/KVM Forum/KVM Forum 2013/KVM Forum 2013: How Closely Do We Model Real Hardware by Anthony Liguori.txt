As QEMU implements support for more architectures and devices, the limitations of our modeling abstractions are beginning to show.  This talk will walk through hardware diagrams for multiple architectures mapping concepts in hardware such as interrupt delivery and device layout with
how we model these concepts in QEMU.  This talk will pay special attention to those areas where QEMU is currently deficient such as I/O request transversal across complex bus hierarchies.
