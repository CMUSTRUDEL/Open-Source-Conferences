Title: KVM Forum 2013: COLO: COarse-grained LOck-stepping Virtual Machines by Eddie Dong & Xiaowei Yang
Publication date: 2014-10-30
Playlist: KVM Forum 2013

	Slides: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzyAwvVlQckeczNUZHRod28yVXc

Virtual machine (VM) replication (replicating the state of a primary VM running on a primary node to a secondary VM running on a secondary node) provides software solution of application-agnostic hardware fault tolerance - â€œnon-stop serviceâ€. Unfortunately, existing VM replication approaches suffer from excessive overhead, limiting their applicability and adoption. However, in practice there is no need for the secondary VM to perfectly match its machine state with the primary VM at all times, and this may be exploited to optimize performance. In this talk, we propose COLO (COarse-grain LOck-stepping virtual machine), a generic and highly efficient non-stop service solution, utilizing on-demand VM replication, and how we can extend KVM to support COLO.

ok so I'm levels and I'm so and for

00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:16,330
Eddie gone we've been the driver for a

00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:20,350
lot of disco Colo work and anyway so

00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:22,180
shall we ever going to do the intro here

00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,180
and then ciao a little tasty

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:28,900
architecture at the end the idea here is

00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:31,570
that we've done some stuff in then we're

00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:36,359
cold all it's working there we would

00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,359
like to extend and put it into black key

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:56,699
legal ah Louis am i stepping missed my

00:00:51,159 --> 00:01:02,409
availability you environmental you got a

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:11,170
server client architecture and the mr.

00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:17,289
Berger how it works in why it works it

00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:20,079
does his own thing oh and by say a kind

00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:23,619
of a framework around that so it will

00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:28,359
take in the request from the high it's

00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:38,280
sorted out to be to the ends that are

00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:40,929
involved here a sector and HPS see their

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,920
responses the responses are collected

00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:48,909
fact I sold off so we'll compare those

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:57,899
responses if they are equal it will

00:01:48,909 --> 00:02:00,460
release the response it's right and

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,429
that's how you keep doing anything

00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:08,690
really the coarse grain is that the

00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:13,460
response late response tactical

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:23,530
and econ long as those of insulin we can

00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:31,850
fail over so the existing approaches

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:34,550
there's a kind of a a and that that

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:38,660
involves a lot and it gets very

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:41,840
complicated especially if you have isn't

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:46,810
the SMP systems are all non

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,810
deterministic in for that kid memory and

00:02:47,260 --> 00:03:08,360
SNP slower than I feel for ya and if it

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:13,160
recipe frag this is the ramos 05 here is

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:16,040
you have a primary p.m. and then there's

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,830
a secondary and it's not just waiting to

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:23,090
be brought up his failed the primary

00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:26,780
field yeah primary will run it's in a

00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,950
recess generation respond luckily

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:42,709
respond till the end of the epic and

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:44,920
into the ndx a3 p.m. now I just want a

00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,920
kiss

00:03:49,290 --> 00:04:08,620
so the problem with I'm set up for the

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:13,570
lochside it's just matt oh mp4 the ring

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:23,530
at all the plate of all your response

00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:25,540
back sighs to make it better or did you

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,980
shrink the epic side and appreciating

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:39,610
see it also more synchronization between

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:44,460
the two here at ice rink so you know

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,460
that I can in the Overland presentation

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:58,570
hello did I think it's a way of doing I

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:04,690
think this is lower the amount of over

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:14,040
it oh and Joe get what they you look at

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:17,500
the requirement to have the feel visa

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:21,450
Ramos and lock step and the idea so you

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:27,250
want to keep the machine safety and

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:32,560
that's a very strong so is actually

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:38,220
stronger than necessary for Kyle we did

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:45,190
it be for the machine and we say well

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:51,730
sequence system people issue is the

00:05:45,190 --> 00:06:00,740
street number talk back what the circle

00:05:51,730 --> 00:06:05,490
of five very

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:13,620
at the output not expect that machine

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:17,130
base and stuff extra have to keep the

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:30,690
machine takes the same and just do of

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:36,240
course rain now this is more formalized

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:39,600
anything yet they response that come in

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:44,670
I see a park the van and a resulting

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:56,270
machine use of it and when that's profit

00:06:44,670 --> 00:07:03,270
yeah the chief event and it's long

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:09,270
Sabbagh get this sequence of primary you

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:23,100
know on Decay primer in the secondary

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:30,960
school okay so that's the ice or the

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:36,810
criteria for a successful failover so

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:43,790
yeah why is it better it turns with me

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:43,790
yeah of course me it's better just to LA

00:07:48,050 --> 00:08:06,000
and in terms of Ramos we don't get the

00:07:52,350 --> 00:08:10,310
ladies always work but it looks safe

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,669
Anastasia Queen a primary effect it's

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:25,889
that rate lower than racing

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:32,310
periodic gap updating so its current

00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:36,440
that wait and see today I'll English for

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:40,710
baby get active to the mailing list and

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:46,490
those are available for people to pay

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:52,140
for this top URL describe that

00:08:46,490 --> 00:09:02,270
implementation and wow now they will use

00:08:52,140 --> 00:09:06,570
Koloff index futures here product and

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:23,190
that weight will come and talk about it

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:25,740
ok vm architecture hi Carrie oh yeah

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:29,360
good afternoon one I always have a

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:36,420
computer Eckener up and then I always

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:46,709
pass or our preeminent premier designs

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:51,000
of the coral again is at what point do

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:54,360
you know ok here's our package right you

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,459
can't they see that there are two other

00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:03,029
machines for rate of em and the

00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:07,260
secondary network servers we thought it

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:12,959
for priming of the secondary else under

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:17,990
the two machines are running at the same

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:22,079
time and the wedding other kind that is

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:25,860
sent to the primary it will be you

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,230
subjected copy to the secondary or note

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,100
others the packet will be consumed the

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:35,610
visor primary vm and the second area and

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:41,360
after processing the respondent of the

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:45,000
earth from experience svn will be

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,670
compared if we find that is the same

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,060
then packet will be announced exactly

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:55,110
without your buffering sorry and if I

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:58,050
deliver difference we think we need to

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:04,970
do a checkpoint which are triggers and

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:11,750
one model under a basic network for

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:16,579
vessel carries and the father are if

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:19,110
sooner the risk of data either internal

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:24,240
side of the lagoon machine just like

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:28,170
yours if you like an average so we just

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,320
need to figure that size of this on

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:36,779
every checkpoint to network I they are

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,990
exactly the same I'll check fine as long

00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:45,390
as you're not live will trigger event

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:48,959
further are some other of emm en casa

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:52,290
price and there are body-color how it

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:57,120
will monitor the healthiest I heard of

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:59,970
it another example when or if our 2nd l

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:05,990
some actors the primary imbalance or

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:14,190
respond it will trigger the able to do

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:17,730
ok let's look more details of the herb

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:23,930
to process this process and reserve a

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:30,690
point or first one is a network traffic

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:33,600
every that we won't change their

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:39,029
existing a vented her virtual network

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,529
adios what we use it directly this

00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:46,029
for the angular width direction and

00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:53,499
mirin let self rather just just being

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:56,229
high so as a u.s. senator requesters

00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:59,409
through internal network to the primary

00:12:56,229 --> 00:13:03,329
primary node and the fact that well fall

00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:07,869
is a user virtual make back-end

00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:13,989
primary mission and and there the packet

00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:17,409
will be 0 and 20 seconds so the target

00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:22,869
will be five primary of the end the

00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:25,599
second earlier under 10 sir the Pegasus

00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:27,879
Tegra spawns of the second area will be

00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:31,569
sent through the internet works to the

00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:34,389
Prime note and their prognosis and the

00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:38,169
second that song will be redirected to

00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:41,499
our familiar in familiar or functions at

00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:45,819
work devices and the contempo ramp will

00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:50,289
take a packet from and can learn one by

00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:52,959
one and the other active second suspect

00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:54,939
it will process your face to the

00:13:52,959 --> 00:14:10,209
register know what network to time

00:13:54,939 --> 00:14:14,859
otherwise it will trigger the point no

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:17,859
sales with us or a will a coffee or

00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:25,839
later of the primary the end to the vm

00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:34,089
with a no trailers are available okay

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:38,669
axes or how storage processor or what if

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:44,919
it will need this exemplification of the

00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:49,269
first natural outlet what we propose is

00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:51,790
as we insert this manager we follow for

00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:55,630
this manner of its finger

00:14:51,790 --> 00:15:02,710
of a natural natural allegedly back end

00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:05,950
there is a like you are a driver so it

00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,560
will be a purified by our coral his

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:12,700
manager so let's look at the first the

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,450
writer of pipe repairs under a female

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:19,750
primary melt the request from the right

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:24,490
price from the virtual machine will be a

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:27,430
copy and there's an accessory to the

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:32,350
affected second and we'll talk on their

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:39,780
TV cash other project manager and in the

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:42,790
meantime sir right sorry and on the

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:46,090
second ring out the right will be

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:49,960
detached insider Afghan cash it will not

00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:56,020
go through the storage and concrete a

00:15:49,960 --> 00:16:00,850
hole in fact for node it will assert of

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:08,650
the traffic exist in Zurich and it will

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:13,290
either advice god yes correct and we

00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:20,370
want our changer River River bigger

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:25,230
either so when when what happens as we

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:31,530
said we want to make sure an answer or

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:39,820
not necessary actually never it to the

00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:48,600
second round we have so we are asleep in

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:48,600
the forest under after ESPN and when oil

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:57,370
will take over under provider is usually

00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:59,910
so we will a user we are happening on

00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,910
the other

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:15,140
here are more exactly a price to be

00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:19,730
propelled through to a lot it matters

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:23,300
and recently left finger a backhander

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:28,450
and the circle of block layer oh it will

00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:33,440
is that every vereda the right request

00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:35,660
nor it modified reservatrol da to go

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,850
down there to give me blood off to

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:48,650
adjust our vendors or crack the ice

00:17:37,850 --> 00:18:08,470
student cash process we want to use your

00:17:48,650 --> 00:18:13,030
reviews oh oh oh nvm and complete Under

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:19,370
Secretary of a little teaser later under

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:22,690
do film what we are to achieve a

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:25,760
checkpoint we just need to do a bin

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:30,500
appearance multigon of migration for

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:33,140
example after a complete prick a father

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,840
immigration process process applicants

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,500
even Servian will be destroyed it but

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,980
here we want their attitude reveal the

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:47,840
complete confused browning so we will

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:53,210
resume the primary evacuation center

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:55,880
will awake the next one and the wedding

00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:58,130
next checkpoint happened we were

00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,290
suspended too much change of their

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,050
primary physician and a secondary

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:07,150
mission you want to copy the rest later

00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:09,770
a chooser a lender as fast as possible

00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:13,070
so we just asked if the restoration

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:15,860
steps and the do the complete set around

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,700
the country sac and after can be step

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,070
downs we will

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,070
resume a bad side of the machine and

00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:31,580
that's basically how checkpoint watch

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:36,980
but we slide in suisun or optimization

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:41,170
because we as we run prototype we found

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:44,690
that there are issues mainly the name or

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:47,750
time-consuming divisor check once again

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:52,490
that we need kopazar memory from the

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:56,240
primer disagree under everything to

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:59,170
checkpoint is long we need men hunted to

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:06,290
the copying and which will have the

00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:10,940
service the myth of it so we propose to

00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:15,110
to user a dynamic popping to enter

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:19,450
muttering was running so we know a

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:24,230
result here with some changes we only a

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:29,720
right to enter 10 we have a break when a

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:44,500
timeout and we are after break we will

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:50,810
check if a user per node under that one

00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:54,440
thing is 100 when it's ripe for abuse of

00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:57,710
memory happen it was a cash it on the

00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,230
outside it will own a theater right

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,620
Souza real memory of the retention huge

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,620
point

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:19,630
let's go to the other half of comic

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:25,600
predictions esker again as if investors

00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:31,150
or design proposals we just want to show

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:35,169
to a liver and the 21 to get feedback

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:39,460
under but we have already done some I

00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:42,490
found them a baby on remet so here here

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:48,309
we have show you how it works on as an

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:54,070
apple in in then we can a week we've

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:57,840
already has a warrant to resolve

00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:00,580
reminisce and we take several of some

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:05,409
assumption programmers rammus under

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:08,530
basel work on yet we will show you to a

00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,809
fourth set of features first one is a

00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,900
native or a performance the second one

00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:17,320
is Ramos performance whether epoch they

00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:20,710
said two milliseconds and the second and

00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,650
a third one is the romantic statue of

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:30,090
forties and may second and the first one

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:33,070
is our a result as a fair after one

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:35,409
advantage of our solution comparing to

00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,770
the runners you get the barricade I

00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:44,590
don't need to be touched until next

00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:48,880
before Oh checkpoint and so in theory

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:52,120
when when you thought you said longer if

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,049
there were computers and other documents

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:58,750
will be better about the latency is what

00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:00,940
the word from other agencies we're

00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:04,030
running the benchmark which is a web

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:08,340
server benchmark you can see other the

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:13,919
result is off if it's not it's mercury

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:18,980
especially when Sir exactly is a lot of

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:25,929
media and I thought we still have her up

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,929
to improve battle a winter what have you

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:39,260
ok now let's look at another as we reach

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:41,809
a cell that our coral is for advantage

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:45,320
of our concerns with a lot of that is

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:50,150
that it can offer authentic after a

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:54,710
while the left is what you get so here

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:58,190
if so that with that letter when we

00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:03,140
services are where we will arrange a

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:16,150
meeting number one two and four and as

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:20,240
we can see that it is almost as you same

00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:28,520
with one two and four or with you so

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:31,700
that we can figure well okay yes another

00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:36,040
under the benchmark of given up with of

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:42,350
me which will if a very best performance

00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:45,200
there's a result keep almost the same as

00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,850
a previous set of data as we can see

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,380
that we are achieved a better

00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:56,120
performance than remiz and in some in

00:24:51,380 --> 00:25:04,100
some as we achieve another phone as good

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:06,470
as negative and here's an another data

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,260
for a father of the end of disease

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:14,080
usability test you can see that from the

00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:14,080
north vidor vm service if you number

00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:26,870
okay yes summer so we believe after

00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:30,620
coral if I application or agnostic

00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:32,269
explosion of non-stop observers of it

00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:37,969
under of

00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:41,830
or we actually as a positive and a

00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:45,979
success with the incident pretty slight

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:50,929
almost got near native fauna and father

00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:56,450
web as a lot of benchmark we risk a 60

00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:58,969
or 70 central- moment and the next up we

00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:02,989
want to hear your feedback under maybe

00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:05,599
we need to redesign our work and the

00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:08,239
language development and the wealth and

00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:12,070
out the patches all reviews under of

00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:22,179
course there are many optimization of

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:22,179
Obama's area so basically I fly ok yes

00:26:26,079 --> 00:27:01,119
which one yes yes are we with our

00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:03,379
information it's a well-executed

00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,609
installation to do like the waters

00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:09,609
better like a good technician pepper

00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:09,609
yeah

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:53,500
nine tonight okay yes yes in our

00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:55,690
information the primary virtual machine

00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,930
and the second the regulation invalid

00:27:55,690 --> 00:29:22,240
around so from this point of view it's

00:27:58,930 --> 00:29:29,530
hot if I snack you mean for this one yes

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:32,910
okay I haven't sorted how's that sir

00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,910
previously but we can have a

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:58,929
yes I can show you the network process

00:29:53,529 --> 00:30:00,669
we propose yeah actually it's a sudden

00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:08,490
matter if they're back end of the house

00:30:00,669 --> 00:31:15,610
order of the tile is net because yeah we

00:30:08,490 --> 00:31:19,029
resurrect package okay the same yes are

00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:23,529
we continuously during the text

00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:26,409
comparison and consumption continues

00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:30,399
that if the tactical response is the

00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:36,130
same the two vm is better of the two the

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:40,539
empty house so it's no matter how long a

00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:42,690
check to the last japon happens so you

00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:42,690
know

00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:55,870
actually actually without already found

00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,750
some or network a comparison of

00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:01,799
immersion as you said that reefer there

00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:05,500
are so many if you work for setting the

00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:10,030
network and the flow will be the lowest

00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:14,830
order of the flow can be different yeah

00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:29,520
a comparison hello not the network in

00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:29,520
fact listen
