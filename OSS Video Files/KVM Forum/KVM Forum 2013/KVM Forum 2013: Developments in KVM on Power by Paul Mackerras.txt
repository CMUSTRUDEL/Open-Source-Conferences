This talk will explore some of the interesting new developments that are occurring in KVM for IBM's POWER processors.  First, we are working to enable guests to run in little-endian mode, and ultimately we will be able to run the host little-endian also.  The modifications required to be able to do this are less than might be expected, but particularly impact virtio drivers.

Secondly, the effort to harden KVM on Power sufficiently to allow it to become a first-class target for OpenStack deployment has thrown up some interesting challenges -- a requirement for nested virtualization support, robustness and reliability issues, and the need to ensure
that the full range of function of libvirt and libguestfs works correctly.

Thirdly, using Linux as a host operating system on POWER machines currently leaves something of a gap in terms of hardware error detection and recovery facilities that on other POWER machines are provided by PowerVM.  We will outline what is being done in this area
and how it impacts KVM.
