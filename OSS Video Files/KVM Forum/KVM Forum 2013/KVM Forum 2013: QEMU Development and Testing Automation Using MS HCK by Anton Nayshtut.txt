Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) is a set of tools, processes, and tests for certifying HW devices, device drivers and systems. Being a great test environment for QEMU devices, Windows Guest device drivers and related Host subsystems, it's still frightening due to deployment complexity. We'll share a way to deploy HCK setup(s) on top of QEMU VMs in just a few minutes.

	00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:16,859
and how after the presentation to be

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:21,000
only two people Vandana and actually so

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:25,890
how do you develop better can in we use

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,940
and benefit from using the my vs h2k out

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:40,129
setting in the oven the cube you kill

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:40,129
yourself k actually filter death oh

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:59,219
actually and it is my mother for device

00:00:52,250 --> 00:01:06,630
certification and it will winner take it

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:10,950
as is for all services and the

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:18,930
management it showed okay in every time

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:22,619
you run some specific cell is execute or

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:29,460
an origin and you repeat it whenever you

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:33,060
want so the benefits for give you an

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:42,020
image community are actually only

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:48,240
utilized beautiful a method even the ACK

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:57,509
so in a different position of attraction

00:01:48,240 --> 00:02:01,799
to sign both and they are all it's

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:04,950
actually covered on any corner of an

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:10,470
idealized you can just measure so it's

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:13,530
pretty useless life if you use for your

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:22,590
assistance it also has before

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:29,840
aggressive scenario of some yet actually

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,840
checked the device or compliance to son

00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:45,630
without a suspect and that ultimate

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:56,180
networking last year is about the days

00:02:45,630 --> 00:03:06,750
of intensive knock life this indigenous

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:10,650
place on and this is as well TKS are

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:16,800
people via specific and they cannot be

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:20,970
partly what in the queue access for

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,700
yourself however we can perhaps learn

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:34,230
from them and try to implement something

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:35,670
like this and limit the ack checks for

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,810
different for management related

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:42,239
scenario and for all with any other I

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,670
operations which is by the very usable

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:52,620
not only so T mu and mu devices for

00:03:44,670 --> 00:04:01,019
Melissa for but also papaya ohta

00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:14,540
actually for many f get here from my

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:24,570
little issue and problem of the Marvel

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:26,130
isn't hdk educate you but what we

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:31,650
wouldn't

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:35,420
well because people at least in giving

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:53,850
you all another work of its bottle but

00:04:35,420 --> 00:05:04,080
it'll be our it actually the educator of

00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:14,160
these ready gambling here's another

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:17,430
presentation of a delta mera gham is

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,820
network configuration is almost

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:30,920
impossible to really develop with HD a

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:38,340
you deserve each ready yet eh a lot like

00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:42,570
a insane in one of environment and there

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:47,210
is no home automation varmint death

00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:54,120
actually spec a reducing a half

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:58,520
automatically of an aberration so we

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:04,950
have a lot of very a lot of village CA

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:09,450
we added a moralistic a while what is

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:15,870
the water dejection three ck is brainer

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:21,870
for donating hpk a third deployment ask

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:29,760
huge it's actually set of people getting

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:33,210
work with a create absolutely okay sir

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:38,160
it's allowed to run different

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:39,420
educational and automated man and it's

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,300
open source is

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,990
under the beauty license to have your

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:53,340
lil angel verbal TK responses around

00:06:45,990 --> 00:07:03,690
with age oh the varnish k make it so

00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:17,820
horny asian asian become brittle with a

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:26,070
about everything yes you ah you can did

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:29,820
she get out of sharing the same party ck

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:34,980
actually I'd like it to get out of its

00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:45,330
managed so it's sold all the items of

00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:52,710
great nation and uh uh oh is also

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:56,340
machine images wrong different a virtual

00:07:52,710 --> 00:08:01,020
se que sera in our company actually we

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:04,970
just have a simple be really pretty

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:10,680
fiery pre-sold this set of images or car

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:14,600
when we have to bring up using a henna

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:27,360
with your friend and what I have isn't

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:41,240
really a beautiful setup needed for a

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:46,140
chic a car place to get an x-ray above

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:48,530
that up top it's really quick oh it will

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,530
see

00:08:51,910 --> 00:09:00,400
pickle is the game that looks like you

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:09,940
will have an education relevance to our

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:15,930
mall to control networks they educate

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:21,430
that up actually isolate all that subnet

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:24,520
involved into the HD a setup & Gazette

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:27,040
of themselves from outside walls and a

00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:40,450
lot of different numbers of deaths

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:50,880
client run free items I've actually look

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:56,620
like that you have practice you said am

00:09:50,880 --> 00:10:01,620
using a week of ratios of either via

00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:08,130
virtual machine accident okay what

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,130
bridge to the out of all this is not

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:25,860
just very helpful you don't see me for

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:30,940
have a coffee read file or whatever but

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:34,210
what is the old bridge is actually

00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,620
disconnects of 3 i'm disconnect from the

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:43,810
world bridge and this way we have

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:47,620
absolutely isolated set up the verse

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:55,690
together them for network devices in is

00:10:47,620 --> 00:11:06,180
a bit more complex you have a healthy

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:06,180
and active which

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:24,610
and this EK and with all this and create

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:33,660
all this connection went on a test you

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:39,329
actually disconnect the world breach so

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:43,959
how to start using the morphe ck example

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:49,179
it's gone from the github prepare web

00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:52,059
images somewhere near of all adjust the

00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:55,480
image its location instead of educated

00:11:52,059 --> 00:12:01,869
the 3g configuration file and just run

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:05,410
the word the HD k shell freak if you

00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:08,319
have to install microsoft HCG a student

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,249
clients from your virtual machines but

00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:19,959
it's also pretty simple and you have

00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:27,660
documentation by microsoft under the

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:33,449
logic a folder itself you have selected

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:38,589
053 okay and you also have yet still

00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:43,749
direct some record with some windows

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:46,540
guest registry let's see how consider

00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:51,249
with your festival is the case the

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:53,889
magnetic violation is educator actually

00:12:51,249 --> 00:13:03,160
insert all the configuration needed to

00:12:53,889 --> 00:13:08,040
bring us together it was from multiple

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:14,040
service in order to do this you need to

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,040
assign a unique redeem yourself and

00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:24,520
to make sure that it is really neat by

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:30,710
the way so you select the device

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:36,220
actually set up dive here you know

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:42,170
nervous or storage material generally

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:47,980
much more tests and we set up a reality

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:57,340
and we domesticate support will inspire

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:57,340
primo ducted breached and efficient and

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:04,180
baggage bridge next year with you five

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:13,240
locations of rear of the images basic

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:20,050
resources the bandage configuration of

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:23,800
yes what number of these views memories

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:32,000
natural device to be used for water

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:37,150
connection will be 1,000 myths it's less

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:43,190
of uniting the right on your table right

00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:47,210
also we have some development related

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:52,340
parameters like we have snapchat model

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:56,510
and they fear here any other parameters

00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:59,770
I like Miss video because buyers can be

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:05,710
passed through the extra parameters vary

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:10,160
by the way were communicating so you're

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:14,210
actually operation is manual yes you

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:20,420
just I'm in the Syrian ground there

00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:22,960
either r and h ck can solve all three

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,960
yes

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:34,910
okay when you're honest without

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:38,120
inspiration summary that is extremely

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:40,930
useful when you run more than one hdk

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:45,529
set up in four wellman you have to

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:51,680
understand you have to distinguish do

00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:54,920
them actually the main screen grant Hck

00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:01,579
Hck shell it actually done the

00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:06,790
configuration is because of the network

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:10,060
ladies in figurations race greatest era

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:13,220
it drums virtual machines in loop

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:17,980
directional of you to allow you to pass

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,980
the form performance-related set

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:26,750
ratification traffic a client fries are

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:36,220
actually launched action launched in the

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:36,220
Syrian plans we have and from diversity

00:16:39,790 --> 00:17:04,610
actually because one in bridges oh we

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:11,110
want yes integration so you have to tell

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:18,130
them oh the HTC a first- accommodation

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:21,650
also a checklist on the wiki page that

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:27,490
pretty small and simple and allows you

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:31,490
to curious to be empty ever escape plan

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:36,920
the most important thing here is you

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:46,390
should not drop hdhp regard instead

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:52,660
they actually an HCA set up outside

00:17:46,390 --> 00:18:00,710
natural allow technicians and multiple a

00:17:52,660 --> 00:18:04,490
set of four test 13 and you'll have free

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:12,730
same Jeff is impressive statistic a

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:22,280
client's episode from virtual share of

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:27,050
ATM machine okay so while HCK average to

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:34,490
carry actually implements of the basic

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:41,090
thing our customers actually need there

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:43,640
are many points to improve it we'd like

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:46,130
to have more to mention the guests I

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,610
would like to support the VP

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:54,620
configuration will be PC kind of system

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:56,780
pipe duplication by Microsoft would like

00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:04,490
to support more support more hypervisors

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:14,540
more the right side profile is revert

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:20,390
and indeed you like good make more this

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:24,080
is example disc educational yes love a

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:26,510
lot of Tehran focus size without any

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,240
user interaction it will really just

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:34,280
amazing progression says when you make

00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:42,220
some change a no Q divided run the test

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:47,090
in yet the rebel actually not only

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:49,760
devices with any device can be tested

00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:52,330
using the baggage a and would like to

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,330
support that

00:19:53,590 --> 00:20:00,820
external configuration and help us to

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:08,390
actually run multiple releases a setup

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:15,590
from single Norris's hov the most is

00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:19,040
also a girl like more flat strong

00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:25,310
because it is really the way you can

00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:29,870
execute this test in part you run into

00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:33,140
success see you then and machine strong

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:39,140
and for a wise old test that will reduce

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:44,750
this time steady we'd like to support

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:48,380
and another half hour ago so actually if

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:50,600
we urge you to reduce the world is DK

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:55,730
for development and testing to you

00:20:50,600 --> 00:21:01,880
devices and Vegeta contribute see it's

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:07,750
open so we have mercy of a case to

00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,750
discuss any improve the infamous ideas

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:44,320
lets up I'm afraid I don't have here the

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:44,320
actual random but it's kind of a kind of

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,390
blue

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:21,970
just Venus will launch the educate i'll

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:26,800
show you the place of death actually

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:29,260
it's kind of visual and applications in

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,370
the district 8 studio it shows you the

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:38,380
list of the test it showed you are the

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:43,170
kind of really it's the test as fast and

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:46,180
kind of remember exactly red X and

00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:49,840
indeed you have love for test yeah you

00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:53,140
have you have love and you have some

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:57,850
basic explanation of of what is the

00:22:53,140 --> 00:23:02,250
problem which did what exactly sir and

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,250
ourselves in some cases yes

00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:40,110
I have 20 weeks left of so it's not

00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:45,419
supposed to be to run really here you

00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:47,700
have you here you have the HTA education

00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:51,899
the application with the list of tests

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:55,909
and the when you run you will see if

00:23:51,899 --> 00:24:03,419
really whether the test is passed it and

00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:11,039
you just can see how massive this test

00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:15,749
series all these tests are pretty small

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:19,110
as you can see on it here you can count

00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:22,320
how many tests of five thousand or more

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:24,389
you have and those tests are stress

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:32,129
tests and different power management

00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:39,379
test and very very very comprehensive

00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:39,379
estes two more questions

00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,860
