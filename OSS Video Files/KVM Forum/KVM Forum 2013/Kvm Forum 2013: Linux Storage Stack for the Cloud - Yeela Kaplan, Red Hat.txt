Title: Kvm Forum 2013: Linux Storage Stack for the Cloud - Yeela Kaplan, Red Hat
Publication date: 2014-10-30
Playlist: KVM Forum 2013
Description: 
	The Linux storage stack is composed of many layers, starting at the device itself (HW), through the kernel modules, user space daemons and the various administration tools. In this session we will review how oVirt utilizes these components in order to implement storage virtualization, using both file and block shared storage, while facing the challenges introduced when working on a distributed system. We will review the usage of the Linux storage stack by oVirt and the architecture decisions at the heart of oVirt storage by introducing the oVirt storage APIs. We shall present how the lessons learned by five years of oVirt storage development can be applied to the openstack storage stack.
