The ARM architecture, despite being endianness agnostic, has been mostly implemented as little-endian on systems running Linux. As this hardware evolves quickly and starts getting used in new markets, there is a trend to bring big endian back into the picture. At the same time, the introduction of virtualization-capable CPUs makes it very tempting to use this technology to provide a virtual big-endian machine running on a little-endian host. Marc Zyngier is looking at allowing KVM/arm64 to support big-endian guests, and extending both VirtIO infrastructure and kvmtool to support guests having a different endianness to the host, without putting much burden on the homogenous combination. This presentation is also about raising awareness that endian duality is still very much prevalent in the Linux world, and not about finding out which of the two is actually better!
