For several years now, oVirt manages Virtual Machines. Then the question came- can you run oVirt inside a VM, which in turn will be managed by the hosted oVirt?In this session we'll understand the intricacies of an egg hosting it's parent chicken. We'll cover the various aspects starting with installation, going through standard operations and ending with high-availability for the hosted engine. Participants will be able to get insights of this unique setup, which will save them a physical server (or even two), while allowing standard flows to run the same way they did in the past years.
