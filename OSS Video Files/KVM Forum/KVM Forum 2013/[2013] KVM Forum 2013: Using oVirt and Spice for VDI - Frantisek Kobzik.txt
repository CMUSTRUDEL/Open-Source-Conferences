yeah okay blow everybody are you ready

00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:18,630
so lucky welcome to my session I'm a

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,609
fine ship complete from from redhead

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,369
from the other team and enthralling

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:27,210
minutes I'd like to speak about remote

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,510
console options normal console access in

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:35,510
over mg and move down possibilities with

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,980
that so so what's in the presentation

00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,860
firstly I will try to fill you in to the

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,969
topic this is very gorgeous is going to

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:48,090
be already short then then I'd like to

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,100
speak about support protocols in over

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,129
engine and we will take closer look at

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,920
the features we actually exposing over

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:59,550
and then the third part will be probably

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,090
the most fun because we will likely will

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,360
take the html5 clients in over which

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,200
it's quite it's which is quite you it's

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:14,310
a nobody NC n spice html5 file clients

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,110
and at the end of the session we will

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,729
speak about future plans and we can

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,909
discuss some priorities you can also

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:27,270
bring up your ideas and discuss it so

00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:30,960
let's start comes one in over 10 G what

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,770
is it n was it for so controlling over

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,960
engine is basically some mechanism for

00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,950
connecting user for our for remote user

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,490
interaction with the virtual machines um

00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:48,240
it is implemented in both overt stack um

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,640
this is just that just to show you that

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,040
cause always to basically everywhere it

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,100
starts in that qmo where it is spicy

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,530
spice cakes out where to spy several

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,299
eyes it exposes some features to over

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,820
engine through lipford and we get Sam

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:10,289
and also as also comes up line connects

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,330
to the clewis 5 server um in the in dual

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,300
application there is a couple of places

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,030
you can see the

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,550
although firstly it's in it's when you

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,370
create or edit virtual machine or vm

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:26,350
template here you can set display

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:29,190
protocol in then we have come to options

00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:33,240
dialog which which is so used for

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:36,460
actually before setting various features

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:40,600
which are provided by the critical and

00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:43,450
then finally yet yeah there is no

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,940
pointer here will show you this little

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,910
thing is the button servers for invoking

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,350
the console our session itself here you

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,780
can see it in other web admin

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,850
application and then use a portal

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,330
extended us apart one basic user

00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:00,220
personal so by using these console by

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,130
using these buttons you actually invoke

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:07,060
the console session tell so much for the

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,520
interim um let's speak about console

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,910
verticals currently we support three

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,790
clinical protocols ISBN see and are

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,739
reading I'm sure you know them we

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,959
support various clients client

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:27,790
applications and we also expose various

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:31,630
features these particles so let's start

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:34,570
with spice for spice we do support three

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,959
types of invocation firstly we support

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:42,250
them donated client which is self which

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:44,110
leverages have which leverages dear

00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:48,280
viewer application which is installed in

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:51,940
your in your system then we use a

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:57,270
browser plugin which should we support

00:03:51,940 --> 00:04:02,170
for firefox on Molly moves so far only

00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:05,860
and then last but not least we have this

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:08,230
small introduced spice html5 client

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,620
which we will see in being a couple of

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:15,130
minutes spice is really feature-rich

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:19,060
protocol and it provides a it provides a

00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:24,669
lot of features but we only expose some

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:26,600
subsets in oburg this is actually part

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,610
of future plan to

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,670
or more features or expose more features

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,610
in over engine as world so what are the

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:38,840
features of us ice road will be exposing

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:41,560
the engine let me just with them first

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,740
the bees we support spice proxy which is

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,380
a way to redirect some Alaric spice

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,340
traffic through some specialized node if

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:55,400
you don't want to expose your most most

00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:02,030
to do outside then we have USB home

00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:05,200
share which which serves for sharing USB

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:09,200
between client and the virtual machine

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:12,680
we also support will gain the using

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,500
smart card there is a really nice

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:21,050
feature one options control which allows

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,850
you to which eclipsers for non

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,760
stretching I mean drinking yeah

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,560
shrinking the spice traffic if you have

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:32,150
very cheap connection again still

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,820
comfortably use spice with this option

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:39,260
enabled and then we have various

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:43,220
features which are provided by now spice

00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:47,180
ve agent for instance let me mention the

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:51,200
time I make a resolution changing in the

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,840
guest OS um which actually reacts to

00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:59,000
resizing to resizing move account a fine

00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:02,090
window for free at four we plan a couple

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,250
of features how to expose let me just

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:11,120
name that these three of them firstly we

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:13,370
would like to improve the clipboard

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,940
controller exposed of people controlling

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:22,280
the overt engine then we also have we

00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:25,970
also want to enable ssl control and to

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:29,140
provide you feel very various myself as

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,630
a soul in the over engine and of course

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:35,240
improvements in spice html5 because this

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:40,220
is actually so far it's a technology

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:43,280
preview and yeah there is a lot of

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:46,850
face to improve it but stuff to improve

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,290
their the next part of all the support

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:54,470
is BNC for VNC we we support two methods

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:58,760
of or two types of clients first one is

00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:02,000
that the bird viewer it's a native kind

00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,490
installing your time to us and it's

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,520
basically the same as in spice case I

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:12,310
was picking out and then also newly

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:15,890
featured client is no VNC which is html5

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,590
html5 console client which runs entirely

00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:21,880
in the browser it's very well on

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:26,990
portable but it's not very feature-rich

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:33,130
so no that's 44 BNC we don't actually

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:36,460
expose any features or any and the

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:40,130
options that can be configured for VNC

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:44,180
and was not least we have this ret

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:47,630
support which is Microsoft protocol we

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:51,380
do support Native Client in Windows OS

00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:53,510
which is this mstsc it's I think it's a

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:59,780
Microsoft omen or Terminal Services

00:07:53,510 --> 00:08:03,550
climbed right ok so we separate this one

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:07,130
and also browser plug-in which is also i

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:10,729
think it's provided by Microsoft as well

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:14,000
it's some kind of activity Adam in

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:19,450
internet explorer which I think it's run

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,390
internally also Rams this nest esc yeah

00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:25,520
we support our DB for Windows OS only we

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:29,090
rely on another implementation in the

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,700
guest itself and let me just mention

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,159
that that our DB is also quite

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,039
feature-rich protocol so far we only

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,150
expose we exposed to configure all

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:44,480
configurable options in the indie UI

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:47,630
yogurt the first Vista a price for ice

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:52,930
arena direction from the PSOs to lie to

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:55,630
us and we have also SS 04 for these

00:08:52,930 --> 00:09:01,360
but it means that if you are all do use

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:04,360
a portal and you you can use your login

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:09,430
credentials to login to the guest OS as

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,660
well uh yeah to sum it up this is you

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,680
can see on this beautiful in this

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:18,820
beautiful table what do we support as

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:21,279
you can see it's quite a covered we have

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:28,029
for each particle we have at least two

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:32,980
ways to how to iron although which witch

00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:34,750
is which we only don't support we don't

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,130
have any plug in roseburg in plug in

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:43,240
support for VNC and so HTML html5 client

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:47,560
for early age I don't know if any open

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:51,910
source client exist so far okay so this

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:56,040
was the presentation and now what the

00:09:51,910 --> 00:10:00,370
games begin I will try to show you the

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:03,970
implementation of our html5 clients

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:07,050
firstly stupid questions for you to the

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:14,020
devil okay you go back to that table

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:21,459
where is it yeah so how about the favor

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:24,160
XP i ought'n windows oh yeah actually

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:25,600
it's a it just exists but it's also so

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,400
far it's something to great tip in the

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,800
yogurt engine it's a part of the plan

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:34,350
but this is what we currently have which

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:39,600
only works so yeah we only have a

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:44,350
plug-in for clinics for release firefox

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,380
x um it's actually no part of over

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,660
project it's a harder from the like

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,000
dumpstering our project which is which

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,620
is the term pirate hat and there are

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,420
some i think that there are some of

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,110
aizen's limitations that prevent asked

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:02,920
to do make this acted ice plugin

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,990
available for overt as well so this is

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,769
it I think that this it's only because

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,529
of license

00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:13,740
but sorry I know I was supposed to read

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:16,529
the source of the activex client without

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,860
authorization from the GigaPan I mean we

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:22,290
want to visit ok but yeah I static

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,570
pinging at this OCD but actually we will

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:27,329
have to distribute but I never pushed

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:31,140
the sources of screens on my phone we

00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:33,810
were very short don't mean and then

00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,990
someone has to build it as well that's

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:45,390
another problem so yeah I'm just a

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:48,149
mechanical work right ok there aren't

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,820
any more questions about this what mean

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:52,440
just through the limo quotes it is a

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,490
think on this wife's not to mention

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,800
necessary yeah so you really have a

00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:01,440
caesarean the gas station I mean yes I

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,100
imagine hair is that using uh yeah I

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,420
mean this one yeah but yeah I forget to

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,149
mention that this is always supported

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,519
but this is only to make in the first

00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:13,380
place to make a slow option I mean that

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,079
in DUI you can actually turn it off or

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,600
to me cause I mean in future there will

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,790
that there could be also you know other

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,430
methods of nessa so I don't know of

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:27,029
anyone but so so far it's only about

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:33,779
making a soldier ok so it still going

00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:36,320
through the gas station yeah yeah keep

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:40,589
on controlling just anything and sibling

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:46,440
ok it's a basically the same ssso it's

00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:48,630
like burning it off it's just these are

00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,449
quite small it features it basically

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,420
means another chick box or set of radio

00:12:51,449 --> 00:13:03,000
books in the UI and some code behind you

00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:11,480
too yeah anything else ok let the fun

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:14,579
begin so I'm every yeah to a

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,829
demonstration or two examples for my

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:19,940
demonstration firstly I'd like to show

00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:32,250
you know VNC client

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:35,520
yeah okay oh yeah geez I can't see this

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,090
oh I think that the resolution is too

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:44,640
big for the screen I cannot see the

00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:46,650
scroll bar here yeah maybe we could fill

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,110
up with with the resolution but imma

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:55,110
church if I showed that to that

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:59,190
intersection so yeah games beyond the

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:01,680
edgy yes oh it's pretty weird Allah you

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,520
know I will try maybe just change the

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:11,130
resolution if it doesn't work at least

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:16,640
it will be fun for you so where do i

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:22,500
change it you know he ever finds these

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:28,530
desks up okay so it's not just a

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:30,900
with you probably oh one of our settings

00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:41,520
here I'm already sorry guys about this

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:44,040
one okay wait a sec let me just okay

00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,040
well yeah that should work this weekend

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,700
yet we can use this so let me just I

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,190
just wanted to show you some of the NC

00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,870
response and it's actually quite it's

00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:58,850
actually really useful if you want to do

00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:02,730
some basic fine editing so we can just I

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:05,130
just try to edit some some file and you

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:18,660
can watch it on the response as I'm

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:20,820
typing as powers so as you can see that

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,820
keyboard response and web screen

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:28,200
responses actually quite good it's a lot

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:31,390
for movie playing but it's enough and I

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:38,420
just yep

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:41,180
see how it works in there some some

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,220
photography applications that yay we

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,580
have this and we have just open up you

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,920
art and no Twitter supportive today's

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,450
it's running on your laptop this is

00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,130
actually running on my laptop and all I

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,080
should also mention that i mentioned

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,700
that it's nested virtualization it means

00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,460
that i'm running virtual host and I'm

00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:03,589
learning there to get guests inside like

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:08,270
have you seen inception I did I wonder

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:12,160
deeper yeah so so much for a no B and C

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:16,490
I just take a quick look at spice html5

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:22,940
and for spice I actually prepared

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:25,339
something more spicy man yeah are we

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:29,690
also live in avoid the scoreboard

00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:36,890
problems I wanted to show you something

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:39,370
short oh oh oh yeah did i mention that

00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:50,810
spice html5 is a technology perfume I

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:55,610
think that I did it actually I wasn't

00:16:50,810 --> 00:17:00,260
expecting that too bad I just sit around

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:05,720
the terminal or whatever I think I

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:08,780
difficult oh oh oh yeah right okay so i

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,900
just wanted to use some video playback

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:21,110
which is quite brave things thing i

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:22,760
guess but no no it's quite it breaks up

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:25,850
from the beginning but you it's a meter

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,589
sec its sectioning some bad also if you

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:33,980
consider the fact that it's nested

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:39,530
virtualization which yeah yeah it's

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:45,360
quite sexy yeah

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:48,660
shows in one with no AC oh well actually

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,340
not I did on purpose I booked it the non

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,680
VNC machine from high so I didn't

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,110
install it oh I could maybe switch that

00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,930
protocol but I wouldn't go that far I

00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:01,770
tried it and it's a it's actually worse

00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:05,330
it's um it breaks up um like much more

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:11,040
which is nice also if you write it's

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:14,070
very cool it is quite nice so what was

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:21,030
the frame right with in Obion see I was

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:24,240
like 0.5 40.2 frames per second okay is

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,490
it this is by the way the summer I'm

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,820
open source removing I think it's open

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:34,770
source movie made in blender so again

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:41,670
it's called sink level hmm is the third

00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:47,970
one ah there's also the leasing is

00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:51,540
broken oh PS later yeah okay so i think

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:55,650
that it was in for mom showing below me

00:18:51,540 --> 00:19:03,540
NC just leave it and what's get back to

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:07,140
the presentation 91 my neck 91% cpus HBO

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:10,560
spices worked yeah well ism i think that

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,460
is because of the divestiture issue

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,570
would it be yeah we ate quite likely

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,420
okay so where is my men doing the

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:21,030
presentation but that actually makes the

00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:27,180
spice performance even more impressive

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:30,540
yeah okay so it was limo and now let me

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:35,250
just least a couple of future plans well

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:39,300
you know I don't let me know this

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:44,670
actually sorry i doon't even Donald any

00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:46,740
life distribution okay girls yeah so

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,500
let's let me just list a couple features

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,559
that were we are thinking or we are

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:57,149
planning for our future releases for

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,759
we have a lot of space in like exposing

00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:03,230
spice features in the over you can very

00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:06,029
little features that we still ignore

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:09,509
there is a lot of work to be done on

00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:14,759
html5 implementations especially spice

00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:17,580
VNC playlist vici 0 5 of course then

00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:20,389
there's efforts to make a WebSocket

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:25,200
proxy which is actually I'm needed by

00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:27,149
the MTN spiced html5 so we could make

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:33,539
this or optional because it's another

00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:35,490
point of configuration oh I'm sorry yes

00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:39,289
well I think that there are there are

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:42,210
these some web sockets patchi's in the

00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:45,059
Indian like your the web celebs which

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:49,740
will be exposed directly from primal

00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:51,480
force the Indian spice servers yeah he

00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,860
carries his family intervention on this

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,259
place ever then you love have like foxy

00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:01,139
see it's desirable as you said it up for

00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:02,669
foxy so if you want to epoxy there you

00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:06,169
can use more approachable and use the

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:08,999
web socket books yesterday why that's

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:11,009
that just makes sense yeah because you

00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:13,799
want never to do that you just rush into

00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:16,440
the spice about you might forget ever

00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:20,460
went to hit about this is single point

00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,129
also it's quite difficult too much sugar

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,909
spice episode approxi all knowledge host

00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:28,860
so maybe that's way off right now

00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:31,289
because other props you have to set up

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:36,409
the proxy correctly and and he also

00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:36,409
don't through a single I think you know

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,470
me to comprehend that not going to

00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:46,080
happen nope it doesn't really exist but

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:48,179
but it does it in a scenario where like

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,590
your other hosts are directly accessible

00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:56,820
and you have already over head of the

00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:59,730
proxy don't thank and it is the way how

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:05,070
it's collected for what normal spicy plz

00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:06,140
right now and we are you still make

00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:10,700
sense

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:17,240
as an option hey so we have more things

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:19,430
to progression okay so there are there

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:24,110
is also some effort for implementing

00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:26,480
spice or integrating over square into

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:30,110
spice and self self which is used at the

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,600
moment I guess and it would also work in

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:38,180
html5 implementation this is quite wild

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:40,010
dream but it it could be possible nice

00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:46,250
looking for a fire for some windows it's

00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:48,800
already done it's nice it's VI but we

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:51,470
don't get the very good so far so we

00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,600
also work on that so what how difficult

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,400
would be that I think that the most

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,090
difficult part would be to integrate you

00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,330
know just to enable the distribution of

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:08,000
the bugging and the installation process

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:10,280
I don't know what if yeah it's not with

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,010
the implementation itself it's just

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:16,940
India where dem jeans looks really a lot

00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:20,320
of clothes for these pups um just you

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:26,060
know this distribution process could be

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:31,520
quite difficult i guess we'll all day we

00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:34,520
will see so um yeah then there is a one

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,620
feature for faded for of seamless

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,860
switching between spice and the MC

00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:43,100
particles in overt it means that both

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:46,250
protocols could be used for running the

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:50,710
MN you wouldn't have to restart the vm

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:55,670
if you want switch from VNC to spice and

00:23:50,710 --> 00:24:00,280
vice versa also there is quite a bit of

00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:02,590
space a lot of possible improvements and

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:07,490
access to the chromosome people so far

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:09,500
yeah it's looks really perfect I got

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:14,110
that were locking multiple access or

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:18,000
making making use of gas station for arm

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:19,620
further please and

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,420
then there is a feature of spice that

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,240
you can mix secured and unsecured

00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,130
channel if you if you use the client for

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,210
instance what if for some reason you

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:39,800
don't want to have audio audio channel

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:39,800
are encrypted you could put oh yes sir

00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,570
if you want if you want um for instance

00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:49,170
of your unsecured you can well sweet

00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:53,250
 you can configure that way but not

00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:58,080
in over hinging so far and yeah then

00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:00,180
some Hardy we can also support some

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,720
hardly find some wheels you can have

00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:05,640
great configuration Kathy I mean the

00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,190
secure channels can be a career path

00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,780
quietly configuration worry I hope you

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,660
get a numeric good yeah he actually

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:16,020
started he hated it so you only change

00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,570
which tunes do thank you I really

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:22,140
thought that it's um all or not or

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,600
nothing like all channels pretty yeah

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,540
you've got a list of secure checkout

00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,400
channels in database and if you put it

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,320
over there it's a give it not really

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,190
over it's not so great I was pretty sure

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,370
that there was some buck oh but which

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:40,140
was ready two days left and we were we

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,790
had a discussion and we came to

00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,190
conclusion that you can use only oh

00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:47,910
nothing okay so I don't explore it later

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:51,840
I'm sorry if that's written sorry for

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:59,090
bringing this anonymous information so

00:25:51,840 --> 00:26:02,880
yeah so these are the future plans this

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:06,480
website this all from me I think for a

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,570
tunnel became a visitor of our pages or

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,910
sorry yeah it just got a question do we

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:14,850
have any future fights for integrating

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:17,070
with spice android client because God

00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:20,190
shall freeze the android client you know

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:23,040
it's sort of Cuenca yeah actually think

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:27,870
i'm told me yesterday that I I should or

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,740
i should mention it i'm not sure if you

00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:34,580
have you bad the point is that anyway

00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:37,640
the portal yes it's unusable of small

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:41,510
resolution well smart devices nowadays

00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:45,470
have higher res ability but yeah I know

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,790
there may start be four yeah yeah let it

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,890
blow like much more sensitive today

00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:52,730
because you've seen on this created it

00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:55,580
was argued actually the guy making the

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:58,429
young ones who have some integration is

00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,190
the radical cations you just again and

00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:05,900
if the vehicle exist yet yeah don't

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:09,020
click on different events we we also

00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:12,470
work over our team colleague who are

00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:16,250
some a client for over so to be

00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:18,590
integrated to this as well you guys if

00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,390
you have Native Client in embroidered

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:24,640
also makes it kind for over ten great

00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:32,510
and mighty fine first guys will be asked

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:37,210
it will be nice so yeah this is all from

00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:39,620
my side and now if you any ideas to

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,380
possible improvements of if there's

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:45,740
anything you would like to see in that

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:49,570
in the overt regarding ones off those

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:54,350
Oaks of course I are just feel free to

00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:59,020
bring it up this story also yeah just

00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:01,850
got a question do we sort of plan of

00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:04,100
exposing the charity ticket on the

00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:07,550
server side me too i assume that the

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:10,040
client could actually use some other

00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:14,679
application for instance we havespicy in

00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:17,000
know me from our addiction yeah there's

00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:21,650
actually a sort of spice plugin for

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,050
chrome which doesn't handle the ticket

00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:26,300
that that the overt engine is and nick

00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:28,610
to do recline itself and you have to

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,920
really put data in there manually but

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,320
it's also way more the windows user to

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,940
be to be able to view the console you

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,710
mean why aren't you in touch with you

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:42,730
yeah all those of this famous keisha

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,730
incredible but we have every school

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:54,440
and well we saved two to deprecate it

00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,870
and to just not supported anymore

00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:01,429
because we have this native execution

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:04,280
that you get the file it's a there were

00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:07,700
there are no plans so far there are no

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:10,670
plans to bring this down look back but

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,400
you know it's if you want even bring up

00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:15,860
some Omega already did pulse assertive

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,250
workaround for the issues we have the US

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:22,370
by 6pm you describe because we had spies

00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:25,160
native application however on over you

00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,809
nowadays at no way of using this native

00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,850
application to connect to the machine

00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:31,070
because you don't expose did you get to

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,900
the reply and they have no why you

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:36,440
walked in here with land whose birth to

00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:40,250
god the kids accepted good must again

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:43,070
and get it yeah okay but usual person

00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:46,400
who goes to think diocese application

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:49,880
wants to get through the air pro reason

00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,799
for book yeah yeah what would like is

00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,419
that so what's more proof so it isn't

00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:55,790
fair to be different flavor a little

00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:59,270
spicy I thing or something like that or

00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:02,270
was it you can actually get it from the

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:04,299
chrome market still again it's a little

00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:09,790
bit in your chrome and it will open up

00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:13,400
the Native Client window program this I

00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:16,280
don't know what if I currently use

00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,850
firefox on Windows and connect to feel

00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:24,650
free I get a dialog asking me to

00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:26,780
download consult of VV if I save it just

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:29,150
contain as being all the information you

00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:33,620
need may have a paragraph a shame

00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:35,960
associated the FSU so whatever I click

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,809
on the tones all eigen I get Vivian and

00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,510
I get my console so there's no man in

00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:45,140
the middle anymore clicking on okay but

00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:47,780
if you wrap and make it a rapper

00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,520
application which is reached that piece

00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,500
of information and you can do anything

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,840
you want with it but that was the reason

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:57,460
why we get rid of the dialogue yeah it

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,460
doesn't really make any sense no sir

00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:20,250
how girls get a job any particular room

00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:22,890
yeah well we have to drive line the

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:28,950
money tomorrow day the example of the

00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:31,470
custom photo from University so yeah I

00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:35,630
suppose there is something from

00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:38,100
somewhere and I'm aware of one at

00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,380
University in Paris has 500 students

00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,760
usually if I don't know what their pain

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,760
points are unfortunate they're not here

00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:58,770
what I guess just because you have HTML

00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:00,480
knowledge mall and the rest of the

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:02,490
spiced even gets in the order of the

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,010
mall sorry I didn't understand last

00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:08,070
sentence so i was wondering because you

00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:10,140
were obviously looking at web page at

00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,960
the IT managers big night and all the

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,900
order of programs that then comes with

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,300
him i was wondering if the most electron

00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,920
pulsar that is provided by spikes html5

00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,560
is very simple doesn't really provide

00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,330
any feature i was wondering if you were

00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,810
playing to improve this or so to make it

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:31,650
a bit nicer yeah of course this message

00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:35,280
to a contestar technology preview and

00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:39,000
there is still quite a lot of stuff to

00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,770
be firstly fixed and then like we get we

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,800
can add new features for instance

00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:46,800
recently I've been attending this center

00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,390
console right alt delete button because

00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:53,280
otherwise you cannot look it in English

00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:56,070
right so well all right you know just

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,980
working the artifice and the users list

00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:02,430
and according to what the requirements

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:05,310
are trying to improve it doesn't there's

00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:08,880
still some quite basic things missing

00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,810
like problem with the upside down

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,670
duration

00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:15,840
windows Lillian stomach you excel driver

00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:17,460
and it's like yeah upside down for the

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,790
reason that some functions are

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:24,180
implemented yet and I'll just be the

00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:25,950
emotional vegan places ice just stay at

00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,800
interaction to stay and everything

00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,780
around the department we in space so we

00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,310
get and the application like books you

00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,460
and love you are we and always ordered

00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:37,740
the wrong that's that's like includes

00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,200
message given pirates you staying I

00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,390
don't know what's the photography but I

00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,240
think it's nice to just have just the

00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:49,140
simple anchor investor simple display

00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:52,050
and then around it people try to improve

00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:55,050
the plaintiff and you know there is me

00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:58,230
into doing but bored fighting equity /

00:33:55,050 --> 00:34:00,720
an engine as you focus on that supposed

00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:03,630
to be certain Firebug the dudes camping

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,510
holidays whether to poo screener we go

00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:08,070
and you know it could go potty very fast

00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,560
hey guys I don't have a serotype

00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:15,180
knowledge but that's why I'm ordering

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,310
you are paying to have improving the not

00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:22,590
despise but just like their clients

00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:26,520
assign these are kind stranger now

00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:31,590
suddenly the set of features we had with

00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:34,020
a pair feeler few things favorite but

00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:36,540
still even though like 12 sounds like

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:43,190
full screen before in that you were

00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:43,190
hungry what's important is the

00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:50,010
experiments a possible because it's

00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:53,490
quitter requires quite a little sister

00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:57,870
o.o system role of a system access so

00:34:53,490 --> 00:35:01,290
unless you have any any extension to to

00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:02,790
the browser or I mean binary thing I

00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,700
think that it could be actually possible

00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:12,000
in using XP home in Firefox yeah yeah

00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:14,510
but it's not so actually when just

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,260
currently doesn't mean like support

00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:21,810
different keyboard layouts and under

00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,250
also how useful it is and how and there

00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,470
are wrong people use it to that

00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:28,380
I'm gonna always be this column is I

00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:30,150
guess that eventually we want everyone

00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:37,740
to work with English game advice and you

00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:44,000
would have to unless unless I guess that

00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:46,620
if we came five clients want everyone to

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,240
that assuming it would have think

00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,490
they're functionalities I wondered

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,410
whether but i would if i would really

00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,120
doubt that you will ever get like the

00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,490
full functionality as the food bank line

00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:58,440
because I mean how will you get smart

00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,690
card fast through how will you get us

00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,000
pure direction and I mean we can do the

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:07,500
drive I don't really know what its

00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,330
limitation this functionality on status

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,670
but when we are there maybe not just

00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,950
with all right give advices think about

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,900
Firefox OS and so on there's tons of

00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,640
things you can do already and I'm sure

00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:21,270
some some of the staff not going to be

00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:25,470
signed up but it will be all this like

00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:28,860
water for chocolate program / Rosa just

00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:32,310
there's no profession a but see a face

00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:38,030
at how it's going and I think in the

00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:40,380
future is something we do in html5 busy

00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:44,060
but I don't think we should feel like we

00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,140
are limited by by a meat-eor unicycle

00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:51,780
brightest idea it's already very

00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:54,680
weathered you'll see yeah but I'm sure

00:36:51,780 --> 00:37:11,040
there are people who are the other two

00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:14,400
surprises whistle I don't have this okay

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,590
if this is all well is there like an

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,580
interesting but I'm surprised there's no

00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:22,830
way to it it's all mental I oxide as as

00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:27,090
existence I'm other they know accuracy

00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:30,240
pretty API that it's gonna stand on all

00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:31,920
the put a black light supplying specific

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,289
certificates to the terror by big

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,309
everyone and then you can get up

00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:40,739
real-time plugin yeah and if you plan if

00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:42,779
you don't require inside even just this

00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:45,269
little thing of the client that there is

00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:49,469
no difference from justify to

00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:51,329
enumeration I mediately Tommy it would

00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:55,259
be better because they say required

00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:59,579
supposed to work I supposed to work

00:37:55,259 --> 00:38:01,709
everywhere right for me and there is no

00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:04,069
I'm going to be this way but it's mainly

00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:08,429
just a customer p.m. biking is well

00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:12,989
beyond people want to invest in 35 our

00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:14,939
planet i think is pretty one so it's

00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:19,859
difficult to support on the platform of

00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:21,900
the haunted yeah exactly yeah trapper I

00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:25,650
like a look at the stake right now the

00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:28,319
fish it's the look that great you'll

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:31,650
notice the process which can be reduced

00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:33,419
with this pretty little bit like this is

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,900
internal exposure i don't know something

00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:45,469
you know you somet when we have but the

00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:45,469
use of okay we'll take that

00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,020
