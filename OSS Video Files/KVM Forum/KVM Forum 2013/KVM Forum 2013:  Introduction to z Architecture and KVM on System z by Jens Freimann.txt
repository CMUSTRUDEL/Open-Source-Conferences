In order to give the KVM community a better understanding of System z architecture and to ease patch review and discussion this is a general introduction to z/Architecture and the KVM on System z implementation quirks. I will explain and discuss with the audience the general organisation of a System z machine, Storage model, Program execution, Interruptions and of course its virtualization mechanism. Provided the audience is not too big, we have enough time and it can be arranged, a hand-on session or at least a live demo would also be possible.
