Specifically embedded use cases often come with the requirement to isolate realtime from non-realtime workloads or certifiable from non-certifiable software stacks. In such scenarios, KVM's flexibility, its transparency to guests, its ability to overcommit resources etc. is less important than minimal overhead, low latencies and a hypervisor code size that eases validation. This presentation points out the limits of solely KVM-based system partitioning. It then introduces Jailhouse, a new Linux-based open source project to provide static partitioning for multi-core systems. Finally the talk discusses the pros and cons of an architecture to integrate KVM's full virtualization support with a Jailhouse Linux partition.
