Live migration in QEMU is a fun thing to debug. You start a QEMU instance on each side of the connection, issue the same command line and hope that both ends have the same understanding of the contents they transmit. But what if this goes wrong? What if you want to verify that what goes through the wire looks sane? What if you want to check whether the receiving end has the same understanding of its data flow as the submitting end? This talk will present a few tools that help in debugging these nasty cases, making everything more transparent and life so much easier.
