Title: KVM Forum 2013: Spice in a 3d World by Hans de Goede
Publication date: 2014-10-30
Playlist: KVM Forum 2013
Description: 
	Spice, the opensource remote virtual desktop protocol, aims to provide a complete opensource solution for interaction with virtualized desktop machines. When Spice was designed desktop environments using 2d rendering like Windows XP and Gnome 2 were the norm. Nowadays most desktop environments, ie aero and Gnome 3 use 3d rendering (compositing). This talk will look at the various options to run a 3d ui in a vm, and which direction the Spice team will take to keep spice relevant in a 3d world. The exact solution for 3d support is not clear yet, so as part of this talk the Spice team is explicitly seeking feedback on how to move forward.

I work we're working on this fashion and

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:13,290
both so I would like to talk today about

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:21,300
other pretty world where everything is

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:25,800
being remodeled you honey I the question

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,320
is how are we going to do training

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,759
really desktops efficient as partisan is

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,160
more graffiti if we're running for an

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,370
officially his final remote me DI

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,140
asturiens oh yes although there is

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,750
impossible to ensure every child will

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,539
quickly up with you and then integrating

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,320
the virtual pretty more dank has to do

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,629
it with five and what the future may

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,149
bring this is all very much up in the

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,610
air very much open for discussion was to

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,190
not run I was tied again like to see her

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,250
like a few people decision question

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,870
Sicilian but it quickly go through my

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,229
chips and I know where we hopefully will

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,210
do some room for discussion so the rules

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,820
tree well this shouldn't come as a

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,970
surprise new the arrow participation we

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,060
have no ability take all the way to

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,950
desktop targeted pretty concentrated

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,110
we're also seeing a development where

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,320
since GPUs are confirming the discus are

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,659
everywhere not only a competitor though

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,930
we had a system level combustor but

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,799
we're also team educational prospers

00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:37,799
activating my firefox are moving through

00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:40,920
a set of where they're doing things like

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,270
deliveries here TFS layers using opengl

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,460
because that's hot really went over

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,860
talker so everything is becoming more

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,930
and more tree and just doing very very

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,490
from city is not an opportunity to

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,829
really support because otherwise we'll

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,630
run into trouble where we may have error

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,189
were English at the patient's home runs

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,229
with a looking into other pretty

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,079
features you really need to come up with

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:05,969
some sort of food nice deck inside the

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:08,550
vm and have a castle I mean we can just

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,110
meet me sometimes regret and do

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,510
everything in chopper we also wanted to

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:17,560
be somewhat accelerated of life at least

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:20,200
so there are two very basic typically

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,730
the movie we can sensibly palm tree

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,060
which we somehow collecting against

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,700
using a virtual d view to GPU videos

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,519
Google reverent of the house and then

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,430
for eloping read Beck's images sent over

00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,110
network or we can collect the public

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,640
school even pipe if I are screwed over

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,739
the network this is a next slide a sort

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,269
of controversial with assets before

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:49,810
useless if the question still later

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:52,180
begging the solution contains about is

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,639
well there are multiple agents and

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,370
forward in creating problems 30 gels of

00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,440
the effectiveness remix from the render

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,599
feasible in a lot of cases like them

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,230
kill those respects will be very slowly

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,109
rendering of the client but the business

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,900
issues probe's vengeance if you look at

00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:13,629
good old 2d graphics cards when we still

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,730
have that we both 95 the BCI box of

00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:17,709
Gouda frankly we're having a hundred and

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,269
thirty three megabytes a second which

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,760
will he can share it with this video and

00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:24,220
a Perkins he has never come again and it

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,769
will cost enough but as soon as 3d

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,010
guards started entering the market first

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:32,980
purpose protecting retrospective of ATP

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:37,329
which was like 400 saw fighting an avid

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:40,269
agency fema pci-express video 0 which is

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:42,220
I must admit for the heaviest he has now

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,019
right and this will go to the market in

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,810
three years so again this will roll in

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:49,419
de pinga which do 16 gig up by the

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,010
Senate 16 gigabyte a second does not

00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:52,720
sound like something which are the way

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,930
for wedding overall of Maccabees network

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,840
and especially if you are to indy di

00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:02,310
from opener running PPI over his doll

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,220
collection we cannot forward enhancement

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,840
so my conclusion for some time in

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,430
commercial business especially if you

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,530
look at the future not the students

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,729
future the better who'd you sleep too

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:18,220
much Nestle life is other problems like

00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:19,510
to read back stuff and clients it what

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,310
is the client list from actually the

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,710
client I'm renovating the house full

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,360
what about capability lot of Solomon

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,810
Russell next with a heavy desktop and it

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,919
connects to this phone

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,610
negotiations that this changes only

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,860
together a lot of complexity the

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,960
complexity come around when you look at

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,930
client-side renovation so outside for

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,159
every probably is the best and maybe

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:48,629
even yogi feasible solution who here has

00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:53,259
not seen Dave spoken further study

00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:55,629
everyone's missing workers so fertile

00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,539
treaty is a work in progress solution

00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:00,669
for viewing accelerates both sides

00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:02,620
pre-rendering it's as a hurtful GPU

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:07,240
suggesting other virtually my computer

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:10,689
which uses the Guardian ET SI Taylor

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,090
instruction language s part of the new

00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:15,490
road I ohg edgewise and this way we

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,169
basically we have a virtual GPU we have

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,810
a guest driver at least as far for only

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,719
s involvement which collects 3d Rowan 12

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,909
months c'mon pretty much resources like

00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:26,409
shaders and textures and it was just a

00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:30,339
comment in the data through to the host

00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:33,189
PP currently this is not true of Tesla

00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:35,199
and is using EG PG oh and a theorem

00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:38,169
rather note this is not true for the

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,839
proof of concept which we sold but this

00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:44,800
is the way it's going to be when we are

00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:49,389
very wanted so integrating virtual 3d

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,669
and spice currently despite is already

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,219
integrated into a music school system so

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,960
you can use 5 as a display protocol

00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:58,449
without using a special spice to excel

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,310
graphical design or you can even use if

00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,469
you excel preferable in fact I use pnc

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,539
is this by protocol or local as y el

00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:06,969
display so they were flattened expected

00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,649
later and we can find yourself sort of

00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:11,529
belong together but you already have

00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:13,330
separation air we want to use that and

00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:15,310
extended to all students will be half or

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,009
decoherence or spy specific attention

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:22,330
which shows doesn't use the console

00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:24,879
system it surround is very sweet besides

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,800
moving at this board will also be eating

00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,810
a new local UI for people who just want

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,389
to start um below glee without the Zuni

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:34,149
have transparency protocol this will be

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:37,240
firmly based on SEL to which does

00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:39,190
smoking as multi multi already this is

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,360
all work data steward and this shows not

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,580
therefore hear back

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:49,750
and million children is talking about it

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:51,789
then between beautiful milky her GPA or

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,099
probably also will be extended with

00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:57,189
multi motorsport event those who will be

00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:59,710
working on that yet after networking

00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:01,389
like finding vse radar screen contents

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,120
can be read back from the host view

00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:06,759
which is expensive so we will avoid that

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,830
before removing as moment it firmly the

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,409
first set they are many because of

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,840
somethings farmer and investigative set

00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:16,900
up to you I so in this case to buy ice

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,419
cream of this place compose and that

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:26,110
will then be channel is way through the

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:27,909
spine flying over the network so there's

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,460
a problem here because for local teams

00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:32,139
we want to avoid slogan that Roger did

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,729
you have your desktop and I the desktop

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:35,650
for reading for pleasure and you have

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:38,979
your local firm measure if you were

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:41,439
fuming very lovable yeah you know who

00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:45,360
have slowed respect all medical team of

00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:48,759
all the data through his hair ah

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,310
etiology tku ice avoiding respects TV

00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:55,180
was running the same protest or even

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:57,490
just this is ready ready to scream but a

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,740
preventive you guys are actually not

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,810
what we used ages these most people

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,909
Irish emergency manager or something

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,949
like that I hope and if you're using

00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:08,620
your manager then you can se you re

00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,779
running in the background you can open

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,750
turf managers refuse and close to view

00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:17,080
or betray you i will it run or DTS so

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:20,009
programs is no set by locally using a

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,860
network transport alexion to your site

00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:27,669
so if your little Zen your number and

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:29,379
brokers objects so prodigiously business

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,240
bill Newton spider efficiency because we

00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:34,390
go through the 3d acceleration group

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,180
will load reverently we somehow

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:41,469
something stiffer even though we're

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:47,649
doing a local host network or level UNIX

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:50,199
file communication we do Rita ah well

00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:52,300
litoris concentration more or less I

00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:53,950
think it helps a lot because lipford

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,790
already is smart enough

00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:00,610
for a local connection to use UV science

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,410
instead of chakras so we can pretty

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,510
easily use how descriptive artisan

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,300
because the connection is already 250

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,090
prolactin tekonsha propulsion we've been

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,790
used as a viewer of the local movie ends

00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:16,060
of the local spicy faith liner or temple

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,560
we're not humor or if you were actually

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,470
in feature if you were a never-ending

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,500
differ I had a little irregular context

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:27,610
switches qme was using to render it and

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:31,570
then finally taken use the render

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:34,270
context to do basically excavation site

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:37,210
for posting again is a technology or

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,770
defect which is GPU memory cells into

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,560
you to throw that on top of this window

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,330
so we're a manually situation or

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,360
renewing application side so if your

00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,010
group is written as the inspector again

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:53,020
receiving applications like pasta

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:56,830
inshallah up here so this will hopefully

00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:00,580
implemented scientific and constructive

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:02,470
ways without that all those I exchanging

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,230
that our viewers will have adult

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,970
medicine work maybe you in from ABI

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,200
changes or giving money to small changes

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:16,600
to the clients that's all very very far

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,520
away so what can you do we want to do in

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,550
the future well first of all everything

00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:24,520
is going to sell for it in the future I

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,560
have been putting a number for my

00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:33,670
headache has not been contradicting it

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:35,080
like being a material a bit so hopefully

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,580
a few years we'll have this liquid

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,160
already start working on our

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,710
improvements looking better go

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,590
representing the pritzker is very much

00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,530
based on the concept of collecting a 2d

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,790
drawing comment stream and then

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,740
compressing little pic snaps like we

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,620
have smaller bones and we have a special

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,390
compression which is optimized for pulse

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,790
after all toolbar buttons all sort of

00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:01,660
use a second address and we'll know the

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,760
only girl is scenario so we'll need red

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,860
lotus forever and she's also look at him

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,730
using hardware acceleration our /

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,800
acceleration can actually also help

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,220
voice the expensive respect in the GPU

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,610
because almost all deepu's holidays use

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:20,810
or at our prayer and Kotick award and

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:23,269
you said I know that stringy also

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:26,690
forever reasons less than we able to use

00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:29,300
that and we can again use DNA box which

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:32,470
is also a precaution before all out of

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:35,360
bubble wrap context to be a pro interest

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,389
so and that will continue to encourage

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,300
you and me immunity back the compressed

00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:43,519
contest so be reading Becca an exclusive

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,959
story for example or maybe d th three

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,269
whatever we do in from harbor and garden

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,860
of the GPU which means that we're

00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,860
reading back around less data so we're

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,079
making tea exactly they're cheaper so

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,240
there's that solution in which which the

00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:01,579
spicy needs to look into in doing these

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:05,300
kinds of things so as problem there will

00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:08,660
be not soon for discussion and we still

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:12,079
have about a horrible crashes any

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:15,339
preference developers I'm just curious

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:19,670
like fighting perfect right head

00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:22,190
including capabilities hajna because do

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:25,540
an encoding or CPU is very expensive and

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:28,279
a trencher better even told us people

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,500
some people do decoding and I'll play be

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,060
here well well you're needed for things

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,389
like subscribe if you want to do skype

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,819
in a very efficient manner then you talk

00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:40,069
when encoding and more and more people

00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:43,160
are also in transcoding so there are

00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:45,079
really two usable in MPC so it's just

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,910
sort of a sudden but one one of the

00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,190
manufacturer startups two-piece event

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,990
unfold it makes a lot of sense because

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,060
if you want to do skype or phone you're

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,589
really needed another desktop i think it

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,180
started as sort of an extra selling

00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:58,819
importance for me not sure who started

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,560
maybe i started it oh we're going to get

00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,060
to the part before don't combine video

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,889
cards because they are framing and it

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,440
all started in the two so now they're

00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:08,060
all doing it and it takes a lot of

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,769
battery is mixing holding a lot quicker

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:14,750
if you actually want to rip dvds or

00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:17,149
whatever no more questions from their

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:21,079
suspected is the video

00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:21,079
watch more official

00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:54,269
you

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,170
carefully I guess it's a mecca by am

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,019
afraid it will take probably 6 megabytes

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,870
you can get away with you 24 pixels this

00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:51,250
pixel so take 6 megabytes of radiation

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:53,410
through HD x 32 this will be your 180

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,089
megabytes a second assuming no

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,279
compression don't know that none loss

00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:59,290
and with lot I don't know how we've lost

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,970
the skin your products are but I think

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,220
what we want to do is we want to do a

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,380
fixed different encoding so we use a

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,089
lossy codecs but if you are insane

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,459
office so we have a lot of text or PDF

00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:12,310
viewer then of course it's it's

00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:15,190
important to be almost as much because

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,470
sex will look horrible if it gets impact

00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,449
life encoding but if you have a 6-bit

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,540
rage and you have juice the freedom sex

00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:24,100
then have to be almost lossless because

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,980
there is no change for the Delta friends

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,199
are very small and on the other hand if

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,870
you start playing bass TV or playing

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,240
movie insider yet then there will be

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:37,120
above changes on screen so with this

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,279
race will get more lossy compression but

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,980
I hope that if we we can find something

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,899
like San any 20 mega bits and they say

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,420
has ten megameters scientists what you

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:49,839
need to three weeks to h.264 and 30

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,750
frames a second to HD so it may be we

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,600
need 20 or 30 because we want to be more

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,860
lossless but again I really do different

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,720
scenarios here one is you're right a

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,420
quiz you a lot of text on your screen or

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,149
a few more effort in it said it so then

00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,680
you can be affixed bit break for your

00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:08,079
encoding we should get closed in

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,850
lossless you know the other entity have

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,439
lots of moving stuff yes then it will

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,079
become law see if you pick a fifth

00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:17,199
victory but at that moment it shouldn't

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,610
be that important its lucky it's

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,790
something which we need to investigate

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,680
and try to learn there or whatever and

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:27,189
maybe someone will come actually up with

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:40,680
a usable lossless codec I doubt it she

00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:40,680
really doubts it's a lot more friendly

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:58,520
what might that will show up as a number

00:16:46,730 --> 00:17:05,030
of Engineers work I have no clue it is

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:11,660
not my area of expertise no only

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:14,810
everything is lot of especially yet what

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,000
we try to do is we try to capture the

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,770
comments from the nest right so I guess

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,870
is saying for what is rectangle and

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,760
rather this text here we try to just

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:26,030
send out the protocols that we don't

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,350
really we are moving out more to in see

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,900
like wonder where we get an entire

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,060
screen in the be well you will have

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,670
distracting writing as prior hotels

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,680
these areas discreet have changed but we

00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,670
don't need you to resend though so in

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:44,930
that's handed will already be

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:47,270
differential you see the question of the

00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,520
day you see any other member of the

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,560
students immediate virtualization for

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,930
example in the networking space before

00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,690
fri don't really not like how obstacle

00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,190
card represents experiment include

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:16,340
virtual functions which you can give you

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:19,820
one guess no time again that kind of HIV

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:23,900
was not be off quietly how they actually

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:28,210
did the marble then the moon that they

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,210
ran all the cheerleaders would you feel

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,870
so yeah they have licensing issues with

00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:39,650
trying to we are collecting for living

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:44,860
judges kernel module for injectibles the

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,860
trivia please help anyone problem is

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:54,480
I probably have a really high imperative

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:04,320
you mentioned retrial vga device is nice

00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:07,000
to in health education for this device

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:38,290
no we're investing in us we go about

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:40,390
more pages in bending it so what is this

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:43,510
t wives who makes the necra

00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:46,810
communicating and watch before i

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:52,270
implemented list which ravaged I device

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:57,300
yes you spend all your provide one dozen

00:19:52,270 --> 00:20:02,920
of you Jake Peavy totally cheated on you

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:05,980
uncommon mutton hear it's terrific game

00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,670
we do the gentleman earlier how to begin

00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:19,750
to happen everyone's expert village GPU

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:22,240
mediate the facial any mortgage I you

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:27,400
talked about music in Masada printer

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:29,290
printing on a GPU in the case where you

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,100
only have a single GPU that you have

00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:35,830
multiple gifts I know nothing about you

00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,100
to use that fun and a PS how expensive

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:45,160
is it to like save the context and

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:47,110
switch I think it made a letter that the

00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,990
harbor and coding bokra short plank all

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:52,800
over super functional immunized if you

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,800
talk in the video

00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:05,750
yeah it may be paid agency to respond go

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:28,730
to each get three functional connective

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:31,039
oh yeah yeah it's a good question i

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,860
think that I friend Cody maybe your

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,049
problem if we get a loan gift because

00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,110
probably need an encoder attended it

00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:41,179
goes faster than blue time so many names

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:43,250
like Einstein isn't a new two or three

00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:46,010
or maybe even four streams on it at some

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:50,529
point we'll use ill encoder will be able

00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,529
to keep up with like 10 desktop on house

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,220
yeah probably will be built right in you

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,590
see a coda 40 receiver for cadets and

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,120
for the next one we use cpu win it for

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,470
another poem you will just tell me no

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,820
surely you can do this with more

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:13,309
dimension or maybe we will need an

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,630
add-in cards that will just get a pci

00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:16,279
express card which is actually a

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,320
hardware and coding cards you already

00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:23,779
have the critical card which i think so

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,460
still need a decoding writer not sure

00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:28,789
but there are already a separate Harper

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,590
am calling cards so maybe definitely a

00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:32,750
solution and then who at one will use

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,659
give you for two screens instead car for

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:55,039
a few streets where we're ending this as

00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:56,870
we go along yes just could be useful to

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,370
accelerate the software and cuddling but

00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,960
you would need to disable them a lot of

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,179
patches to your software encoding stack

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,070
to actually use that information from

00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:06,409
our frame building i think thats

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,269
checklist i mean if you look at the ATI

00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:10,729
no row as far as I know you

00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:12,619
to get a block with some february's keep

00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:15,169
you at a distance cool encoding and

00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:19,580
you're not in control he just frames and

00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:21,830
that's what you feed it now we're not in

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,109
control there we have no way to actually

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,940
pop that information you level which

00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:29,659
could do something useful with it on the

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:36,109
ark raincoat time it's an interesting

00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:38,179
concept any more questions from you

00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:40,279
mentioned the guests are often running

00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:43,429
headless and only when you bring the

00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:45,049
connection up you need Leonard by

00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:49,039
rendering only on the house is there an

00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:51,019
issue expert senior referee yes we will

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,339
have to get another reason that you will

00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:56,299
have to contain your rendering on the

00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:58,729
host yes but actually there's no

00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:00,589
consistency issue whereas to implant

00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:03,079
rendering activists at the famous to do

00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:04,820
some renovation so if you read back from

00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:06,829
the client you will get lazy but its

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,700
eventual immunity if you can read back

00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:15,349
on the house you get a different memory

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:17,329
glsl fix black head to actually buy

00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:19,489
always doing all the reading of the hope

00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:23,889
you do better distant people just beat

00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:26,929
you p / and GPU power it gets us remix

00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:28,879
but you can probably new response of

00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:31,969
their at least for vdi like solutions

00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:33,799
that you just suspend to get if such as

00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:37,119
the edge connection air comes in

00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:37,119
connection for a couple of minutes

00:24:54,930 --> 00:25:07,230
migration Mary to hopefully the

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:07,230
moderation should work I don't work

00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:28,860
first real ugly one so pretty routine

00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:37,570
all right I think we're out of time I

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:40,330
guess maybe one more question so anyone

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:43,420
at the file question the answer is where

00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,860
is google force so if there are no more

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,030
questions I want adventure for your time

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,470
and I want to point out that there's a

00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,470
