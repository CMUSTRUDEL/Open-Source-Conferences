Title: KVM Forum 2013: Spice in a 3d World by Hans de Goede
Publication date: 2014-10-30
Playlist: KVM Forum 2013
Description: 
	Spice, the opensource remote virtual desktop protocol, aims to provide a complete opensource solution for interaction with virtualized desktop machines. When Spice was designed desktop environments using 2d rendering like Windows XP and Gnome 2 were the norm. Nowadays most desktop environments, ie aero and Gnome 3 use 3d rendering (compositing). This talk will look at the various options to run a 3d ui in a vm, and which direction the Spice team will take to keep spice relevant in a 3d world. The exact solution for 3d support is not clear yet, so as part of this talk the Spice team is explicitly seeking feedback on how to move forward.
