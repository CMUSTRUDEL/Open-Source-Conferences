Various optimizations and techniques have let KVM achieve impressive performance, even though its userspace component is protected by a "big QEMU lock"---not unlike Linux's old "big kernel lock". Performance challenges and real-time requirements are now giving impetus for breaking this barrier. This talk will present past work that has made QEMU subsystems more scalable, explain the existing threading infrastructure in QEMU, and propose ways to extend it and use it.
