	Slides: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByCzJ3AoWZuuS19lVXl3blZZaUU

The Trusted Compute Pools (TCP) feature in oVirt provides a way for administrators to deploy VMs on trusted hosts, which run expected hypervisor on expected hardware with expected configuration. The TCP feature in oVirt comprises an attestation broker in engine, modifications to the VM creation UI and template, and enhancements for RESTful API among others. This feature requires deploying an attestation service based on OpenAttestation(OAT), an Intel Â open source project Â with the mission to provide an SDK to build remote attestation services for ISVs to implement cloud/enterprise security use models based on IntelÂ® Trusted Execution Technology(IntelÂ® TXT). This presentation will introduce the OAT project architecture, the TCP feature and its implementation details.

option I'm aquaria injured engineering

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:11,610
manager retail doing the perfect

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:16,440
solution okay well this this this past

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:19,350
is done by my colleague wake up so I

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:25,260
come a basket to do the presentation and

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:27,570
hope I can our most of the message this

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,449
is a Linda we will start from the

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:34,230
background first in the bad ones will

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,690
tell you what's the issue and why we

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,960
present this trust in a bit input to

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,930
solve this issue and basically if it's a

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,590
picture and the key component but in

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,860
this architecture is basically how we

00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:53,070
integrate our basic calculator vision

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,070
code into the award letter we come close

00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:03,559
through the information videos and

00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:06,600
followed by the turn back one okay here

00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:11,060
this is the issue so we are moving

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:15,000
faster it was a cloud but there is new

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,640
security need for a job as you can see

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,470
from this picture to this picture this

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,979
picture is a traditional fitness center

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:26,070
we have the physical machines of

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,920
facilities to do the isolation when we

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,110
move to the cloud given into the private

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,890
this isn't the posted by the hidden

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,890
price we lose this kind of six maybe the

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,470
women women can provide the conservation

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,070
it does not have the phone that people

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:47,640
can easily see and feel and for the

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:50,670
public cloud you have say where is the

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,979
other energy issue the sinful have

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,350
posted differ from different companies I

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,689
don't know if the from the a and B are

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,040
competitors today we are willing to do

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:07,409
so so there is the infirm here is in the

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:11,039
cloud we have music critic leading so

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,130
I'm exam with the basically we try to

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,280
present the

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:20,920
traffic including full and which fiber i

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:23,680
isolated the toe of post from all of the

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:28,620
hosted dragging the virtual machines we

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,270
are able to provide the user the

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,730
verification you can see your virtual

00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:37,350
machines is driving in this pool of

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:41,250
machines so you can't trust this

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:43,840
basically a key component of here is

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,600
from the middle a we will need each of

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,170
the foster running hosting the virtual

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,550
machines as the entail txt extension is

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:57,010
the transcription X technology

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,530
essentially interview is a pitch that

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,110
dynamic through the task then foto de

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,450
parte booth and the colonel you have the

00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:08,490
actual a mirrored and launches of the

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:12,600
boundaries and the only sequence is the

00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:16,420
way can etch away into one know that you

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:20,500
pcr registers in the PM that value can

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,930
actually represent the Seekers always

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,150
critical mission for example it's

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,940
looking loved-up i keep of the wig

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,570
version maybe is running the kernel

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:36,730
version strip of its it's like that then

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:39,400
we are trying to add more that is of the

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,770
remote and temptation essentially you

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,560
will you will try to from the

00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:48,190
attestation server to ask this post

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,760
please transfer the value to me so that

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:55,690
I can jump whether I can trust you then

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,230
that's the visits from this we can use

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:01,320
the policies of judge whether we can

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:06,400
form this the trusted computing pole and

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:08,830
we can also show this in the user mode

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,680
more user-friendly way or you can PO you

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,430
can show you that ah just 50 lakh days

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,770
here we have all the hosts they are

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,750
these are just be computable geometry

00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:22,440
machine's a piece naturally hosted in

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,440
this promotion

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,830
here the people components i think i

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,710
have already thought about in the formal

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:36,849
page the first of all is actually the

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:39,930
harbor the hardware requirement we need

00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:43,330
the hardware is in kop XP technology and

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,240
the pen for me is launched by the people

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,759
and the west of ma then we need the

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,120
remote attestation stories to provide

00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:56,050
the attestation and also we need to

00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:06,190
enhance to the management tools to to be

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:09,880
PCP away any question ok inst Eliza is

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,250
actually it is Tracy was the the in

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,190
healthy X technology I think I have

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,159
we'll talk about later in the form of

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:21,340
science is to try to establish a dynamic

00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:23,740
root of trust instead of the I mean

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:29,110
aesthetic aroopam faster beginning from

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:32,550
the house and from the from the I think

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:36,460
from the peoples are trying to enter the

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,669
child assignment time able to the past

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,449
then we see to the wheel megan is up to

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:45,400
the colonel of the bmm then to the

00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,930
secrets can follow for example the firm

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,930
and the measure and the gumtree

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,870
certifications all the sequins they will

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,789
fasho value into the register into the

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,610
fifth year now the back that is the

00:05:54,789 --> 00:06:00,729
value contracted and basically reflect

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:07,569
the system and you have to take six

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:11,560
Gators next one is no part of the whole

00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:14,560
key this is actually what we do to

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,009
provide the remote attestation this is

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,610
basically a sdk for managing the hostage

00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:25,029
everything verification and we are using

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:27,909
the pc pc to be fun remote a pathogen

00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:30,069
protocol and the istari hate and the

00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:33,330
cloud and enterprise management troops

00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:36,930
including the Oaks Day and the world

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,930
here in the source code

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:45,729
this is the Holy architecture as I said

00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:48,819
this we have a dedicated a status over

00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:51,999
here and the release is our agent in

00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:55,869
each of the motions that a host in the

00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:58,989
virtual machine and i think is quite

00:06:55,869 --> 00:07:02,709
simple it has the query api for example

00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:05,139
people may ask the polygon forward ask a

00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:09,069
taxi to server whether a host can be

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:11,769
trusted then let this api interface will

00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:14,679
ask the freezer of the leader we are

00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:17,769
easily pass through this whole study I

00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:20,709
and it will talk with the host able to

00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:23,199
get that value back to list a testing

00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:26,259
server then they are testing server will

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:30,159
compare the value to the white legs to

00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:32,619
know whether it can be trusted if it is

00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:37,269
even yes you can put this machine to the

00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:39,719
traffic computing home that's it is also

00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:39,719
a question

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:49,650
okay ah they are pictured basically this

00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:53,070
activity is not about oh it t is the

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:57,660
about how they integrate with it into

00:07:53,070 --> 00:08:01,380
the world so we need to have the Holy

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:05,220
agent in the end machines which running

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:08,820
the virtual machine and we have the

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:13,260
dedicated server then we literally has

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:16,980
the word let bagon the engine could talk

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:24,600
with the only server to gather the the

00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:29,280
traffic computing ho information this is

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:33,060
the video the components which aim for

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,780
the PCP here is the way check the

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:41,700
actuated Oh agent into the post Paula

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:47,340
note on any note and we will modify the

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:49,920
overt engine we modify the API and since

00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,770
like the managers photos of the matter

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,590
is to present a paragraph or through the

00:08:52,770 --> 00:09:00,500
command line they need to be aware of

00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,500
this translate convenient whole concept

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:17,890
sorry ah here is actually a photo / we

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:23,080
try to do the technically addition it by

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:26,950
this we mean we try to come define a

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:30,339
cluster all hope of computers whenever

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:34,089
you put half of a host you can verify

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:36,400
whether it can be trusted if he is then

00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:39,850
put into this poll if this machine

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,910
rebooted you will do the tactician again

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:46,089
if we can continue watching it remains

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:49,690
if otherwise we needed micra with all

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:52,839
the vm to other trusty the host let's we

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:56,470
call us statically partitioning I see I

00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:59,589
need to see a few more days because we

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,350
have another architecture we have

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:05,380
another using model of this tcp this

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:09,990
hallway integrated pointing into the

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:12,660
OpenStack we call it the family history

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:16,060
that means week they do not come

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:20,200
construct a hope all motions and at

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:24,580
first instead we will post to the best

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:29,620
area to the schedule because in that way

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:32,230
we are we it was that is it easy to

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,470
implement you know is that we just need

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,950
to add a house train a new a sprint for

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:42,280
the normal schedule just for the news

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:45,940
conference like this virtual machine

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:48,970
needs to be run on the trusted host then

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:52,120
we each time will schedule try to pick

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:55,750
it up machine the filters all the host

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,540
based on the list including our criteria

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,630
for the passage at all then we can

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:07,450
decide a machine that is traffic forces

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:10,450
the virtual machine but we think the

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:15,790
statical partitioning inspector because

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:17,650
ah we do not have the one hand getting a

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,950
cost because you have so many motions

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,560
each time do

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:24,860
scheduling you need a spirited it again

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,630
and we don't have the micro register for

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,620
the issue I mean because we already

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:34,160
constructed at Hope at ICU my greater

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,280
being in this hope you don't you don't

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,680
need to do additional work otherwise

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,290
like a little stack when you to the live

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,560
migration is killing me to be the

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:52,790
trusted some field aware so that you can

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:56,920
choose the right hi micro okay next is

00:11:52,790 --> 00:12:00,230
the implementation details clickers ah

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,690
this is the feet Peter Peter here and

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:06,220
the we started our work in December and

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:08,840
Adele and affinity holds the 2013 and

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:15,560
starting from over three thousand three

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:18,290
we this is available this face shows is

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,680
possible in the web page where you try

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:24,620
to create a new cluster we added a new

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:29,660
property based or illegal traffic the

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:32,240
servers in the back in the side in this

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,000
one is actually we are trying to do

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,930
something to construct this computing

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,960
transitive computing home like I said of

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:45,350
another you put have a host you need to

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,420
do the to the remote hesitation to find

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:51,110
out the weather in a chemical in the

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:57,950
trust level all the vendor hosted reboot

00:12:51,110 --> 00:13:02,290
you need to do it again in this wise is

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:05,600
actually saying we are since we need to

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:10,670
construct the follow computers that is

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,400
traffic we do the hesitation we do the

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,460
aggregated affect patient basically we

00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:20,630
divided the checking tickets the member

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:24,170
vs as long as we finish as anyone we can

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:27,560
have a small for computers you can use

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,990
to launch your washing machine otherwise

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,540
you need finish your checking all the

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:39,130
hosts then you can

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:41,649
first appear in a database class before

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:45,100
work I think the biggest add a new field

00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:49,720
to indicate whether there is the trusted

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:54,399
stories ah this is all so

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:58,360
straightforward we passing the risk in

00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,399
the innovator the pastor at them this is

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,670
the old web format they also had a new

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:07,269
for a flag in the OEM to indicate

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:10,329
whether this virtual machine is exported

00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:12,880
from a trusted computing power then

00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:15,819
later when you import the data virtual

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,220
machine it if you imported edible

00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:22,600
thermogenic to the chocolate applicant

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:27,459
pool again ah that's okay otherwise you

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:30,880
work at a warning uml this is the you

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:34,480
from later on it lightly this portion

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,899
version may join may run on an untrusted

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:46,600
cluster so from this point of the

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:50,500
testatrix for the future work is about

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,529
the high availability I actually this

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:57,160
high availability is not about the high

00:14:53,529 --> 00:15:00,279
availability for the happy host of the

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,120
node who runs the virtual machine it's a

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:05,529
vaca de Leon Hess kitchen store

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,069
currently the intestine server is the

00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:12,130
single server so if that breaks we lose

00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:14,500
the functionality for example we can try

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,069
to say no to why is the dragon the other

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:22,360
is back up this is the powers that are

00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:28,860
very thick made of editing work so far

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,860
any questions ok

00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:35,550
then let me come to a summary I think in

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,810
a summary the trusted computing hope

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,389
provided wait for the cloud and

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:44,350
datacenter the demonstrators the

00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:46,420
deployer VMS of trusted as host so that

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:50,139
we can provide the data protection and

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,899
the service differentiation for example

00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:54,760
we can track people more if you really

00:15:52,899 --> 00:16:00,279
want to run in virtual machine another

00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:04,810
traffic for another is impelled txt in

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:07,329
the fundamental 00 the building drug for

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:11,529
this specific company info you need the

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:13,930
hard work of this figure and from the

00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:17,199
software bottom view we hit people and

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,889
we also need the open a station to

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,839
deliver the together and deliver the

00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:26,139
traffic on giving poop well the people

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:29,949
is mainly from the founder and the host

00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:32,320
who provided a fiscal integrity a status

00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:36,190
while they open up a safe day is really

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:41,399
to do the test agent jack whether this

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:44,920
post can be trusted ah any questions so

00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,959
so who provided a wild days I mean in

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,990
your destination you say there's a while

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,750
a sewing machine but who provides it and

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,699
what's the criteria so for example use

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:59,410
amazon and the amazon provider

00:16:54,699 --> 00:17:03,850
information for me yeah yeah yeah sure i

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:06,220
think you mean how you can get the

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,299
information to judge whether this can be

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:14,530
trusted like yeah i think the study from

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:17,260
the txt that has that when the table try

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:21,790
to establish the dynamic root of trust

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:26,919
it use the special cpu instruction from

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:30,820
that point a register in a TPM one of

00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:34,000
the PCRs is initialized the nature when

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,280
you launch the venue following the wrong

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,410
signals for example the tip of the way

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,770
or try to lunch

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:43,080
the colonel they will measure the

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:49,830
colonel that the manager value will

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:53,010
extended into the flat pcr so at this

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:56,420
point we can ensure the value is stored

00:17:53,010 --> 00:18:00,210
in the TPM no one can modify the ten

00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:03,060
other part is covered by the whole key

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,430
for the they have a follow the TCG

00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,730
defining remove the testicle protocol

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:12,290
try to get that value and the trust make

00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:16,250
where the network to the testicle server

00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:18,990
then is up to the your service provider

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:22,230
whether they want to expose this value

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:26,400
from you if it messes well you can

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:28,920
compare the value to to the value you

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,140
have to determine whether it is trust it

00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:35,160
or you don't hope in the value you can

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:38,550
say if we use linear the supertones 3.8

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:42,270
the various like this if we use the

00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:45,480
Colonel's 349 the various like at least

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:47,610
so you can judge whether you want to

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,740
trust it because for you know you can

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,380
trust the the later one because the

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:57,930
salmon when and how do you the nearest

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:59,790
stream called night has a the in that

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,810
portion of the colonel maybe the hidden

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:05,550
has enhanced the isolation of a lot so

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:12,240
you can translate it more interesting

00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:16,850
like that doesn't answer your question

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,850
Europe know so any other questions

00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:30,210
nope oh thank you Scythia that's it

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:33,530
that's all me oh just before everybody

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,530
