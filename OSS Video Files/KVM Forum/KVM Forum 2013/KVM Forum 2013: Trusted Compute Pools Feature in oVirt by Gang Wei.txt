The Trusted Compute Pools (TCP) feature in oVirt provides a way for administrators to deploy VMs on trusted hosts, which run expected hypervisor on expected hardware with expected configuration. The TCP feature in oVirt comprises an attestation broker in engine, modifications to the VM creation UI and template, and enhancements for RESTful API among others. This feature requires deploying an attestation service based on OpenAttestation(OAT), an Intel Â open source project Â with the mission to provide an SDK to build remote attestation services for ISVs to implement cloud/enterprise security use models based on IntelÂ® Trusted Execution Technology(IntelÂ® TXT). This presentation will introduce the OAT project architecture, the TCP feature and its implementation details.
