Memory virtualization overhead has a huge impact on virtual machine performance.To reduce the overhead two level paging was introduced to virtualization extensions by all X86 vendors. On Intel it is called Extended Page Table or EPT. Nested guests running on nested VMX cannot enjoy the benefits of two level paging though and have to rely on much less efficient shadow paging mechanism which, combined with other overheads that nested vitalization incur, makes nested guests unbearably slow. Nested EPT is a mechanism that allows nested guest to benefit from EPT extension and greatly reduce overhead of memory virtualization for nested guests.
