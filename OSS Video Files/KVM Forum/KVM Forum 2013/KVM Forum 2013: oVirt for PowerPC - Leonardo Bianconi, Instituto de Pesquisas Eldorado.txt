Publication date: 2014-10-30
Playlist: KVM Forum 2013
Description: 
	oVirt is a virtualization management application. That means that you can use the oVirt management interface to manage hardware nodes, storage and network resources, and to deploy and monitor virtual machines running in your data center. Currently, there is a developer group adding PowerPC architecture awareness to oVirt, which currently makes various assumptions based on the x86 architecture. Many projects are being involved in this task, like: LIBVIRT, QEMU and KVM. In this presentation, the current status will be reviewed, the future challenges will be discussed and the participants will be invited to take part of the oVirt for PowerPC group.
