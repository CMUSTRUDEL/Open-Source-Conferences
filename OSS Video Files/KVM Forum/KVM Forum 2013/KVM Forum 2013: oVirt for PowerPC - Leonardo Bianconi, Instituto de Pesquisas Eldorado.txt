Title: KVM Forum 2013: oVirt for PowerPC - Leonardo Bianconi, Instituto de Pesquisas Eldorado
Publication date: 2014-10-30
Playlist: KVM Forum 2013
Description: 
	oVirt is a virtualization management application. That means that you can use the oVirt management interface to manage hardware nodes, storage and network resources, and to deploy and monitor virtual machines running in your data center. Currently, there is a developer group adding PowerPC architecture awareness to oVirt, which currently makes various assumptions based on the x86 architecture. Many projects are being involved in this task, like: LIBVIRT, QEMU and KVM. In this presentation, the current status will be reviewed, the future challenges will be discussed and the participants will be invited to take part of the oVirt for PowerPC group.

so where we were in where they're one so

00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:16,800
little bit of all about me I'm the owner

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:20,430
game going from a spoon and he'll

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,949
brother mr. xi wach engineer then in

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:34,850
other words not-for-profit organization

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:38,550
located in Brazil but it looks so

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:45,110
presentations about bringing a good firm

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,110
platform initially for x86 and ppc64

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:57,719
well why and I beam has announced in the

00:00:52,879 --> 00:01:02,940
kvm empower I think it's for next year

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:07,470
and the open power consortium and let's

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:11,880
be partners you have allies is choose

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:14,520
this this is for well here I have

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:23,939
challenged you want to know more about

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:27,210
it just access here the agenda I'm going

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,990
to talk about the idea and how we are

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:34,259
changing the software and what are the

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:39,810
problems problems we are facing and what

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:48,360
we did until now but missing where's the

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:54,840
code and conclusion like that so here

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:59,159
the idea i have this draw about the

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,649
system and as you can see here and we

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,829
have data centers where we can add

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:11,670
storage network device and clusters so

00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:12,870
tube8 over it has a specific platform

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,590
that is x

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:20,489
six and our idea is being able to create

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:24,480
posters for ppc64 so they can be

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:27,239
parallel in our role here is that in

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:34,709
which platform and with minimal ship

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:40,739
chains in the UI in the cove well about

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:44,359
the problem and the structure in was in

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:48,379
each end design for a smoke platform so

00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:52,769
inside of it we have some enumerators

00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:56,040
that I described the network types

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,980
display device series interface in this

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,829
interface so all these types are

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,640
displayed to the user so we need a

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:14,370
mechanism to feel bad because in pieces

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:20,400
is for maybe the sport sometimes here i

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:24,269
have an example for network types this

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,930
is the moon from the encode for tips

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:31,230
this is for they eat 1,000 not important

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:38,010
so we should not explain that to be

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:41,430
music yes follow me my hotspot it or we

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:44,370
have tested this with your

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,859
environmentally and we couldn't work

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,230
with that all that means it's a frog it

00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,730
doesn't miss much Molly sorry if it

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,400
means it's about really they should not

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,620
it's about you know occasionally dpci

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,019
judges were anything but i also just

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,190
work anything you want everything is

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:07,049
either and okay well we are not walking

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:12,180
these circus ring birth control for now

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:18,690
so in the future we can show is this is

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:21,169
using heavy mm yes you need not getting

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,169
a decimal

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:32,850
well another problem is that there are

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:35,820
such assumptions for that uses it so one

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:39,270
of them is addressing CD that's

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:47,540
different for our ppc64 so in this case

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:51,960
we need to switch the behavior well our

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:54,420
proposal is and refactor the code using

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,270
this stretch design pattern where we can

00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:02,250
switch the comb and a basic from der

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:05,790
pepper I have here diagram and with the

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,750
idea of the strategy basically we have

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:13,290
an interface in the implementations the

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:21,210
invitations will take care of each act

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:25,590
ethically so the benefits here is that

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:28,740
we can switch behavior at runtime the

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,380
final fan of allergens that in this case

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,560
we have a specific course for each

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:38,300
platform avoid leaves our on the whole

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:43,110
and easily identify where is the pool

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:47,010
specify a platter then it's easily to an

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:54,270
another adapter so no way where you have

00:05:47,010 --> 00:06:01,080
to change well what we do until now

00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:05,550
which it last week well we can separate

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:09,270
in griffis first we things piled all day

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:14,610
except a six coats AC and we move it

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:18,450
that for the strategy we forget reside

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:22,500
some parameters a specific of

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:27,720
architecture and we folded some physics

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:30,890
for specific phone so talking about the

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:34,190
the first phase we have created own

00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:37,330
parameter that's funny

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:41,150
diameter well inside the system we have

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:44,690
the CPUs where we can choose for the

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:49,580
cluster so we need to specify for each

00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:52,010
our petrol disabuse well the initial

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,230
development of strategy design pattern

00:06:52,010 --> 00:07:00,170
and replacing all of it at least six

00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:03,470
foam inside of that so about the

00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:08,300
configuration files and a member of a

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:13,880
community has given me osm five and that

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:17,270
is awesome Oh s parameters so after some

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,660
discussions we decide to add the

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:25,280
architecture chebet so on Oh SUV

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:30,110
specific of exactly what it means you

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:34,400
can provide advice and some informations

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:39,350
for that is like a network device the

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:42,050
device this device new devices and it

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:47,600
will be a bishop future and this

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:51,590
information in the front game we can one

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:57,590
bake that in the back end and minimize

00:07:51,590 --> 00:08:02,660
type of specifically here i have an

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:05,630
example of the OS configuration and this

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:09,800
is the first one we are working as we

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:16,580
can see here and we have specified for

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:26,180
1664 city interface e cosÃ¬ the protocols

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:29,180
here and 10 the list interface so we

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,539
have changed the engine you will be

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:36,349
changing in the guessing that's the part

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:39,740
of the code that states in the host so

00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:43,910
for the engineer ed addressing least NCD

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:46,310
in VSA we get some cold for the

00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,340
following processor name in harbin

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,560
formation

00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:55,050
I'm not sure now if it's different for

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,780
pixels for or it's a bomb that will be

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:06,330
fitted with different future so we can

00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:09,690
manage that 20 in the pizza now here are

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:14,070
11 example of the code above the grid

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:17,130
calysta's interface please be here mr.

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:22,400
receives all the informations to

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,400
generate the x and y app for xml file

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:34,070
and here i don't know if anyone can see

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:39,300
that so we have added the sparkle

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:42,450
vesicles and for both case where we are

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,390
calling the strategy so we get a

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:51,210
strategy based on the architecture of

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:59,700
the vm in and create an object 10 best

00:09:51,210 --> 00:10:05,880
that like an acronym so here I am Etta

00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:07,790
meow generated and for x86 and x64 we

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:13,730
have highlighted there the controller

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:17,280
wax happen the bbc's is far has always

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:23,730
placed this controller at controller at

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:26,970
address 0 in x86 version so I need to

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:33,500
specify the controller one Lex I which

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:33,500
one to be handled in question

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:43,460
so we had a problem and developing the

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:47,570
strategy design pattern we have placed

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:51,230
in the files inside the the poem and

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:55,580
civic project so all the other projects

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:58,070
can see these files to use but the

00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:01,760
strategy files cannot use the specific

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:04,370
files of the author sub-project so for

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,970
addressing the CD it needs some specific

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:11,840
code then we saw that with the vistors

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:16,160
device design pattern where we create

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:19,220
the the code in steinway simulation

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,520
project specific and creates a normal

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:27,550
acting past that part a strategy so the

00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:31,580
benefit here if we have in specific a

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:35,960
victory for an egg factory you just need

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:42,590
to create a class file as a as a Vista

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:45,440
and pass that further strengthening this

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:50,240
is an interface for the history well

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:54,680
this code hasn't sent to the community

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:58,810
yet it's not there and maybe some chains

00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:02,630
so the comment comment here as well

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:08,300
member for as an connection for x86 and

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:13,040
another one for instance in sport this

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:17,000
is the implementation for everything as

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,750
Percy and scuzzy we have a method for

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,040
x86 that's the nothing cause it's

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:29,020
handled as it is today but 456 for we

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:39,220
are addressing vistas at address one in

00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:39,220
spider viscosity a data 0n question

00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:48,900
well which features are ready and for

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:53,150
end users and can say and we can create

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:56,400
rage Buster's VMS templates and groups

00:12:53,150 --> 00:13:00,780
import and export themes and templates

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,060
at that least two VMS search beams by

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:07,890
our detector that is the nuclear you

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:15,600
have waited and many things of that 456

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:19,590
for this are cross-platform specific

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,560
features have you is the rest are all

00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:25,200
the other features working for you live

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,110
snapshot like my crazy LOL nvm spice

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,970
connection what's the ever talk about

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:36,540
later so i have here is some screenshots

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:42,090
and this is the point for cluster

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:45,750
creation we have added the the BBC spew

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:54,480
name in the bottom of the list as we can

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:59,100
see here is a screen on little machine

00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:04,260
created creation mutually i have chosen

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:07,290
up our cluster in the other fields will

00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:12,140
be filtered based on bed so i have

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:18,660
unting play a few foreign pink lady here

00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:24,210
that in place need to be power as a

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:27,980
tester its power as well and another

00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:32,040
filter here for operating system i

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:37,490
obviously the OS will be filtered and it

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:41,760
is it only close direct actor and then

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:45,089
another one and is a protocol like it

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:51,420
spice not important for BBC 64 so we are

00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:52,649
showing only B&C well as i said for we

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,259
are working to

00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:59,730
I do not change too much the interface

00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:03,170
so what we have done in two now is you

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:06,779
can filter and filter in the fields and

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:09,839
and as you can see here you don't see

00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:15,660
any cute for except maybe in the future

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:20,970
but now it's like that another one here

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:24,029
is adding yeast mix filtering the

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:28,949
interface here we put in it's not

00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:34,800
supported by a party bc 64 and we have

00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:44,189
hit released this same for network

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:49,290
interface well what you missin and we

00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:53,029
could install the OS best and accurate

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:56,550
needs all the bed but with some tricks

00:15:53,029 --> 00:16:00,230
we need they're not doing third

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:04,230
installment for exactly or what sorry

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,720
once I couldn't eat all the guests what

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:10,620
it was that that does install didn't

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:17,069
work almost something else well we try

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:21,929
to solve some some OS and like a fedora

00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:24,449
19 and that didn't work we we don't know

00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:27,269
exactly what happened me are looking for

00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:29,639
that but we doesn't lean of it still

00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:33,059
fedora not say hunt you're heading on a

00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:37,499
living hell well maybe something's

00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:44,730
missing well we should yes we do ask

00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:48,899
more flags to cake made let and the rest

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:52,139
we spoke was the filler turning team and

00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:55,089
we did install this one but the other be

00:16:52,139 --> 00:17:01,420
couldn't even read a full inhalation

00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:06,470
yeah oh you're not using idea oh yes

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:09,290
well actually we are working on kimmel

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:12,020
related but we are receiving some

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:15,020
machines to test and the nice a turn-on

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,209
emulation but our life in wuhan work was

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:22,100
a crazy time receive instructions yeah

00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:26,720
okay nice to know ok VI mature sweat

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:30,730
yeah nice well I network booting not

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:35,900
working we are looking for that in some

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:38,510
syntax about that well migration in

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:42,110
snapshot I have doubled Alexander and

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:46,160
said it's not working they are they will

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:54,760
work on that computer in hospital and

00:17:46,160 --> 00:18:00,230
some devices are not calculated yet well

00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:03,370
we are working on provide so the these

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:17,110
capabilities are basically not working

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:20,419
beautiful yes there're any way plop them

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:24,100
yes we are doing that now we are walking

00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:26,840
on the right and he'll appear just not

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:31,370
automatically according to I'm guessing

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,250
morning cutie supports capabilities but

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:37,790
actually when humans protected all of

00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:40,250
these things a lot so all of these

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:45,110
things should work and they just don't

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:47,169
because well it's work to do it on we do

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:51,410
have the ability said I don't think they

00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:55,040
spend into thats just the fundamental

00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:59,030
feature that this way um it's realist

00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,910
matter of facing only we should even

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:04,250
consider locking decent providers to the

00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,420
word they don't wait until you use

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:11,450
reading up to

00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:13,010
Oh some did you have to block so viel

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:18,110
stuff for example you cannot postpone

00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:21,050
yeah but every time you find a pci

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,640
device tells the word show it expose it

00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,110
and if you use it want to use it and it

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,320
doesn't work have to use a part of our

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,940
Peapod against q if I know my place

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,010
doesn't work haven't followed by

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,130
literally every is this box the

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:37,430
cuneiform I see mailing list or well I

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:40,070
would yes gimme PVC vinyl is a good

00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:43,310
point otherwise if you when you need you

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,990
actually the knowledge of one kvm um you

00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,930
need to get a special machines maybe em

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,910
but they don't sell today so your we are

00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:55,910
in contact with IBM if you do have a

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:59,030
machine that can run discover the local

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:02,300
aggression thing ably is simply the

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,610
liver when you save my grade tries to

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,720
run communicate am on the destination

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:12,320
and inhuman package of CUNY system PVC

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,620
package doesn't create acute ATM little

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:19,430
script so it's just the liver tonic p.m.

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:21,350
am rather diseases before it's just a

00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:24,020
really trivial little if has he been

00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:26,210
together like my vision for policy right

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,400
that my vision is usually thinking right

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,950
if this is the gap alive edition for

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,900
focusable in a good place yeah it's the

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,900
current after you will have another one

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:57,260
can add a script to test it it's more

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:59,540
info and largely and Hector we are

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:04,850
providing sputtered Alliance popper

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:08,110
discussing for if this is far and gentle

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:13,190
all changed situations when it has a

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:17,650
data line a PA or hope because they are

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:20,650
not compatible the barracks is fine

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:23,650
and using their pace that in the hot

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:31,570
blooded and provide networked move we

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:38,080
are working on that but about my razor

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:41,860
phone it's all in the get as fat and

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:47,310
hairy and some links if annual 11 to see

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:47,310
what's happening so just access them

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:54,370
here just a picture of four facts and

00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,280
like I said the first one have

00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:03,040
introduced the attacker field so the

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:06,670
other ones are dependent of that these

00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:10,510
other ones almost out then are based on

00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:15,820
the configuration file so we don't need

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:18,820
and basic him to q-switch behavior

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:24,070
between platforms just use the

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:28,150
configuration file hey these are some

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:32,590
pads for gsm so we have one margin but

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:34,720
all the other ones are with very

00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:43,060
fighting and i think it can be married

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:46,300
son well we have measured our best true

00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:51,280
way to them if anyone is that you know

00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:56,110
then how it is today it's hosted at each

00:22:51,280 --> 00:23:01,450
body the both projects engine nvidia

00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:06,490
same and we have some structions in the

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:11,710
average week about how to build and and

00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:18,550
one day so if anyone's interested just

00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:22,180
ask that so conclusion well after all

00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:29,590
respects reintroducing in the main code

00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:31,059
will be able to to a host of XD 64 and

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,330
the over change

00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:41,799
be prepared to handle another bad first

00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:46,600
mark easier than today so there is he in

00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:49,830
question I'm an elliptic thing people's

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,720
end up missing on this whole question is

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,279
that there are two completely separate

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,230
things there's the different

00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,389
architecture and there's a completely

00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,190
different machine part so Alexa mystics

00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:01,389
we traditionally only have the pc

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,029
machine that we don't care about

00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:06,639
anything else we could probably also

00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:08,919
model a one of the new quad processors

00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:10,720
from Intel and scientists are you know

00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,539
compatible thing but nobody really cares

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,399
so we don't expose anything that doesn't

00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:17,440
look like if you see an ex v6 on policy

00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:19,779
however we do have like five different

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,909
types of Justin CPU types then plug

00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:23,740
anything the same CPU Turks on this are

00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:25,980
the same on those machines you could

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,330
just as well any light like Mac machine

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,480
I'm not saying it didn't make sense the

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,820
overt scope it doesn't at all oh I think

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,820
over that the g-series platform just

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,999
work you're targeting is the only hot

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:42,009
but it's not so you're basically

00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:44,080
introducing if you're overlaying those

00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:46,809
two things so you're basically assuming

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,200
the PVC 64 always means pcs which it

00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:52,179
doesn't necessarily which is fine for

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,889
existing support out the anywhere in the

00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:55,629
Oval really care for anything else at

00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:59,379
least not for now I have heard people

00:24:55,629 --> 00:25:01,090
asking about well support for over

00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:03,490
Bonnie 500 which is a completely

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,159
different set of how easy CPUs so there

00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,860
it would quick so and we need a model on

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,450
top of the architecture some like that

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,820
then I think that will become more

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,789
significant for are well-armed it would

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:18,190
be very interesting i guess for how it

00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:20,110
by but so it depends i mean you could do

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:24,159
two things you could either say we

00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:26,499
separate this into cpu type and model

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,809
type or quite frankly i will just

00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:30,580
combine those two oh man they are the

00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:34,809
sensors and cpu time it's two different

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:38,139
things dip each leaders model so i would

00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:40,330
only model the target machine and

00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:43,059
nothing else so i would say i want to

00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,620
spawn a p-series machine and the fact

00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:45,940
that this is a PowerPC machine

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:51,309
just an importation detail on what you

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:54,940
cute icing at you just cannot choose a F

00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:56,860
lon whatever up to 12 you on your PC be

00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,559
special that's a clearing minus n kind

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:03,850
of thing right right so the Q minus MP

00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:09,100
series supports power 7c use he knew bc

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:15,130
six before users from BBC 64 minus m PPC

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:16,450
500 supports e 550 500 cpus but it does

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,490
not support in all seven so its

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:21,910
architecture which is one thing that's

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:23,980
we have the cpu and then we have modeled

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,750
emulated machine I think you can

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,570
completely ignore the architect I don't

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:31,450
know anybody else I think people only

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:34,600
care about the machine on PCs you simply

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,929
support pci and actually 60 use that you

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,540
can plug it on machine type p series you

00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:43,860
support power 7 power eh whatever pci

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:47,200
and vio devices that you can plug on a

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:50,170
dvc 100 machine years apart PCI devices

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,870
only and give a hundred types in its I

00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:55,120
will just completely ignore the

00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,620
architecture don't even call it BBC 64

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,530
it doesn't have anything to do with it

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:02,650
it's really just specific to this is a

00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:05,380
machine off tiebacks and that has

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:10,420
capabilities then it is DBC 64 is really

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:14,350
just a petition together if I mean just

00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:16,960
for naming one with histologic instead

00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:20,080
of calling it the x86 and 364 I would

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:25,960
just simply call it pc and pcs so the

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:38,050
rest is the same are all they're not

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:40,000
ungrateful he immerses you whoa that

00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,710
committed in machine yes you could

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,020
not find great yeah like it's different

00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,950
machine guys the migration is about city

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:51,330
youth but not about the emulated machine

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:54,190
now so migration includes the machine

00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,990
when you're not angry but if I'm running

00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,450
two different emulated machine on the

00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,340
same and to host have the same

00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:05,710
call cpu in them like when Gretchen

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:08,500
shoot work you have two different hosts

00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:11,890
and sang physical same cuz you go cpu

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,930
and ux into you're exposing the same

00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,420
virtual machine like then like vibration

00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:18,880
should work more exciting if they were a

00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:22,210
virtual net on those two hosts i can run

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,610
two different emulated machine right you

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,990
can yes and live migration should work

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,050
because it's the same supplied by

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:30,930
version to work at the same time you yes

00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:33,490
you can even go as far as just I mean

00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:36,070
honestly I would just have a cup of a

00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:39,040
compatibility flag that says my machine

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,930
is compatible with running a PC machine

00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,030
with running a p-series receive upon e1

00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,260
l.o machine because you could just as

00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,580
well for prototyping I me what you guys

00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,040
are doing is you're running all of us I

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,890
66 right so actually your ex v6 machine

00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,420
is compatible with power to see subtle

00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:55,600
because you're emulating in full

00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:58,540
immunity but then I one in KTM right now

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,000
they won in PCG so you actually six

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:04,270
machine suddenly becomes a PowerPC

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,950
machine so sspeak right so its anode

00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,680
configuration that you sustain your node

00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:24,430
is compatible with p series um if you

00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:27,760
enable TCG well anyone get interested to

00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:32,430
know about it we have the week this is

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:35,880
my name well anyone to help as well

00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,880
