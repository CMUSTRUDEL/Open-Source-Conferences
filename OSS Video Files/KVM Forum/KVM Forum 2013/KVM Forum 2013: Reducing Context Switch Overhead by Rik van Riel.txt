people don't want opinions of me I hope

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:22,619
this next up very good XP thank you and

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:30,330
I found a very low level management

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:35,090
staff this isn't a kam has some of our

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:42,649
positions with best fashion worthless

00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:46,590
and we give it out some of the posts

00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:50,850
office problem and a few different

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,530
potential solutions to the issue Oliver

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:58,170
should suffer from a source of agreeing

00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:03,600
of craziness but it looks like one or

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,070
two of them may be so unreasonable and a

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,170
girl something people I talked to before

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:12,540
breakfast anything else down another but

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:17,030
first let's take a look at that what

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,030
exactly is the message classic work

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,580
waiting with worthlessness and we short

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,280
messages it's meant a little bit of time

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,720
processing each message in a quaint

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:34,290
little coy and for a Western next

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,250
message and the intervals between the

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,500
images are often quite right Mexico be

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,189
writing remember that we lower than easy

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:49,649
it will be in xiamen process example

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:51,720
Java process that is trying to get walks

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,909
he had many business rest will try to

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,219
get locks at the same time when every

00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:01,409
rock is taken asleep until the Box

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:04,340
released lots of her plans are affected

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:08,759
by is this transaction processing stuff

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,009
any web server talk to later days he

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:16,370
probably has

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:21,319
most likely channelling because he

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:24,769
couldn't Alya Graham that you render a

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:30,349
little bit you go I oh and you're also

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:32,540
home flight level but it you need to

00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:37,190
very frequent transitions between

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:42,140
running an idol out to tell 100,000

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:45,909
ratings of a million 92nd and next over

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:49,510
that in that path and really hurt if

00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:51,829
you're running on Colonel on bare metal

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,560
all that really happens at this point

00:02:51,829 --> 00:03:00,799
believe and the first transition running

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:06,579
vital is that we store registers where

00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:09,620
is negative and I'm storing the EU

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:11,810
registers sure and the Miss nomer right

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,239
now because both the vector operations

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,870
SS e and a lot of other things like it

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,980
will share the same registers and

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:23,329
spectators ridership needs to be saved

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:26,060
to memory and I'm going back from my

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:28,699
mother running the astoria registers

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,129
below to the enemy of mountains but we

00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:37,489
don't always have students colonel has

00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:39,680
pretty good lazy mmm you and then we

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,840
also recorded it you state she's not any

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,349
other things that are better note

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:50,510
optimized after you love the hardware

00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:53,569
now is that we just saved it and nothing

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:56,389
touched memory that we say they stated

00:03:53,569 --> 00:04:03,079
to the most of the time harper also me

00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:05,480
skip blowing the useless if we get

00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,180
virtualization into the mix this

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,260
transition cast someone who won't cost

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:17,449
me we drop into the host when I guess

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:21,010
cuz file here went then the host also

00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:21,010
has this phone here you stick

00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:26,750
and it has to do this for some reason

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:31,310
I'll get into suitable there's no way

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:34,340
optimize this hell it has to update

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:40,130
these eps they run the scheduler oh the

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:43,970
doors a step or not it and going back

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:47,870
into the guests take your own transition

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:52,130
from is running a spirit is twice out

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:58,610
again and will Revere answer and he got

00:04:52,130 --> 00:05:01,310
updates on those things like that what

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,970
is up here of course from machinima

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:07,640
spike is exactly where we spend the most

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:13,610
time whatever things we would eat up to

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:16,730
myself if you switch it over that is

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,640
less the idle time as a person of

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,480
initiative because we're done doing all

00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:28,460
the Philippine to do before the next

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:31,520
message voice but a really high over

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:36,770
that our turn he read my message great

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:39,440
professor he only wanted to be night in

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:44,210
the worst half of the time but switching

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:47,990
overhead is quite large and a red arrow

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:53,740
in there is the expert time that we have

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:59,860
to spend before we get back to look and

00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:02,600
that can be nice slow down programming

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:08,000
the dynamically messages can be

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:12,590
parachute and making any longer is it

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,040
assembly it's the same time I guess it

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,050
worse if you are dealing with program is

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,930
talking for other pro panic on the steam

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:24,410
system maybe it is a virtual machine on

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:27,200
different facing people or indifferently

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:31,130
see you in a different version machine

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,740
on the same system if the programs they

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:37,259
both attend each other messages

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,870
and wait for each other and they both

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:44,030
get slowed down by the extra switching

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:47,550
offer that things and really slow down

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:49,979
to the next week when the switching

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,060
overheads in his homework and the time

00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:55,590
it takes the process of messaging

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,550
routines of instances always happening

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:03,690
with four books particular with one that

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:07,919
you saw is a let's go talking to the

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,960
basement notice Peaceville if the West

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,539
cover makes enough queries for every web

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:17,250
page it's really visible from web

00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:20,909
browser times and in several users who

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,699
have large multi-threaded programs

00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:27,900
running inside a vm guests and get

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:31,229
slowed down to let me have our speed to

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:37,409
Aaron embarrass me because they ask

00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:40,680
overhead that we have where is he over

00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:43,979
there the transition from idols were

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:48,180
running it's not that big of deal

00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:54,570
anymore hardware optimizing else the

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:56,400
restoring of the end use it and we used

00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:00,300
to have over that switching into the

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,539
guests next click DVD Iowa inside

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:08,909
plastic really reduced your fat in that

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:14,759
path the big problem is switching from

00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:18,990
running into item look clear exit has

00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:22,349
optimized very nicely those lazy storm

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:26,880
of the United States so that it's not an

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:33,390
issue either see here is a very nice

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:36,149
optimization reduce the floating point

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:40,820
here on the overhead spends taking

00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:43,050
restore including work however the

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:47,170
optimization

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:49,839
virtualization mountains read a bit more

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,850
nights this part is really slow and the

00:08:49,839 --> 00:09:00,310
schedule itself takes a little bit fine

00:08:51,850 --> 00:09:02,230
point it's not real instance one of our

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,839
support people has read into it

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,269
potentially worth of whether it happens

00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:12,930
to be okay imagine do that various

00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:18,490
things like by running a number of tests

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:23,680
with emotion code he manages yet but

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:28,440
Uhuru 35,000 transactions a second this

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:32,860
particular work then you in visit the

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,350
scheduler go by simply stated during

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,399
boost the sweep you into the low power

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:42,790
saving mode with aberrated cello seized

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:46,450
it and you can explain improvement

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:52,170
without a moment that's represented by

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:55,680
the orange slice device fitted over inna

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,540
density phys ed would say hold and

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,350
visibly alert is giving me floating

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,140
point save that turn at me the biggest

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:11,140
pump in quarantine proven that he got

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:15,040
the entire yellow part of i is all for

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,740
the points if mr. i don't really storage

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:22,329
not the issue because i wrote a patch to

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:26,140
the 13-4 lately and i got exactly zero x

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:28,449
+ 4 minus p hardware optimize that out

00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:34,750
very very nice so in a hole the yellow

00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:37,540
part is this only home safe but three

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:41,980
quarters of your exit that is an

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:44,380
original test he removed the cpu booth

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:51,060
and her and hiring a very slight

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:53,790
improvement any memory here on both DJ

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:58,020
the whenever the guest

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:59,700
a tidal incomes running against and it

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,540
never traps in the most traditional

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,950
sliding routines this also the best

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:10,200
performance personal tests but running

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:16,620
with you little idiot is not an option

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:21,000
or separating that if I am more Indian

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:24,500
guest runnin Webster and as I the

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,210
message related acer is another quest

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:32,340
and he needed it the restaurant replying

00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:35,310
my message then it really helps if when

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:38,910
I go idle the host stops running need

00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,560
and runs the database by continue

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:44,250
running and every truck to the host when

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,990
I mild then of us might not run today's

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:50,820
looks and I'm never going to get it

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:54,030
going but everything that is you simply

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,640
make a trick of EFT low overhead and

00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:00,540
maybe some of this integral overhead we

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:08,850
she had two forwards that is very close

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:14,010
to the best the remaining awesome for

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:17,280
words as always is optimizations in this

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:20,610
case enter an amine have optimized

00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:24,050
officially used be pretty fast when they

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:28,980
are busy all the time and they love our

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:32,360
reliable winner but they're not the best

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:38,370
switching between Milo and running

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:41,310
hundreds of thousands of Sony 27 the

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,470
gases in context which is very against

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:47,550
any context switch between all processes

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:51,930
in the st not ever trapping the gas can

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,240
also be loading a mistext forgiven

00:12:51,930 --> 00:13:00,030
processes inside guests without a host

00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:04,020
economic and this is the week without

00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:07,010
any way of informing host nothing's

00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:09,320
going inside of the XPS

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:12,980
they have used a change ready my cousin

00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,710
and I guess it goes Michael all the

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,540
whole construction ensures the most and

00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:22,610
the world will see something else needs

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:25,940
to see you other the host has absolutely

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:28,430
no way know whether the up against in

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:33,740
any context which is determining whether

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:37,640
he stays changed so we hope always has

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:40,220
save it is this which is about three

00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:46,910
workers of the magic overnight but it's

00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:50,600
kind of work so it can be debated we can

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:52,700
see then we couldn't avoid trapping to

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:57,470
the host and avoiding all those objects

00:13:52,700 --> 00:14:01,660
witches if they are short awesome maybe

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:04,490
the reason for the costs to do that I'm

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:09,080
paralyzed is dead I'll get into that in

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:11,420
a moment another honey is lazy and you

00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:16,040
switching which happy another few years

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:20,420
ago the only salient used it when

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:24,920
somebody else needs the fu or will be a

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:28,070
cute content until tomorrow's and third

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,770
idea that I'm looking at is doing

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:33,590
context which is more basically instead

00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:36,830
of switching to the eye with us the

00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:43,790
girder process which would be lazy it's

00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:48,830
good because MVP the idol desk I start

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:50,360
living as pervert very first I will tell

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:54,170
you what is a snake driver is impaired

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,470
muscle and then what's different about

00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:03,980
our virtual items what I issues with the

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:09,440
desert reserved imperata if you have

00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:12,830
idle says when is the persistent with

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,090
title to Colonel a good EP sleep against

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,300
which part of this would be off

00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:19,430
essentially in order to get the power

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,690
say

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:27,620
several signals available and the more

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:30,500
power you say the more merciless eunuch

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,320
split off and the harder it is the

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:39,020
longer it takes to get assistant back up

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:43,880
and running you've known on title and in

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:45,230
order to pick incorrect think that we

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,680
need we have to do this predict the

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,770
future you can imagine it's not away

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:56,390
from earthly and we don't have a generic

00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:58,130
algorithm predict the future but there

00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:03,640
are some reasonable things whenever I

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:08,180
will get woken up we will compare the

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:11,870
estimated sting fine only 100 actually

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:15,310
start and we will use email know if you

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:19,670
were wrong to correct our future

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:23,330
predictions and the code seems to work

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:26,390
very well in them at all but over a

00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:33,020
virtualized will be a lot harder and

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:35,240
I'll get one a little bit comparator for

00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,870
an alien for example the room table like

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,480
this and the device driver where we have

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:45,770
X 11 see in the dark Resident Evil 4

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:49,970
different power saving homes the TV can

00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:52,940
go on this table the better the power

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:57,370
savings but it also takes a lot longer

00:16:52,940 --> 00:17:02,020
to wake up on the latest a state on him

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:05,689
c6 it will take 200 microseconds

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:08,600
playback totally unacceptable for many

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:13,730
workers before going on the air travel

00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:16,010
costs a little bit shorter ok please

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:20,240
days I are gonna fail the shorter

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:26,900
experiences another time we'll go down

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:29,179
to c 1 and 2 C 3 doses can be

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,090
problematic for supper clubs but there

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:33,730
are changes in works too

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,860
they prefer the regular little more

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:39,309
intelligible intelligent about sticking

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:44,590
to the shallower suspense when there are

00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:50,980
shorter policy para virtualized will be

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:55,360
similar except instead of thinking is if

00:17:50,980 --> 00:18:00,580
you skip blood we simply decide whether

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:04,990
or not the trap into the hypervisor when

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:06,850
we have an idol year increments and i

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,320
hope to tell the guests our army will

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:13,690
take to travel to the host and get

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,020
switched back into the guest you can

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:19,840
choose divided the video need to do

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:23,409
states today if you stay in a nest on

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:28,120
your idol or we travel to the most and

00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:32,169
host their own opinions as a fundamental

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,669
issues with this because we don't really

00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:39,399
know how long it will take for us to

00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:41,830
wake up when the hardware is dead we

00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:43,570
know exactly it's going to hit 29 /

00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:48,640
sentence for twenty two hundred

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:52,899
microseconds for that implement but if

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,450
we charge a host host of the year switch

00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:59,080
back in a given to us or you could use

00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:02,020
the regular guest and switch pencils in

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,590
10 minutes weapons she's essentially

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:10,990
forever and since we don't know how long

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:14,190
a host to switch back to us it's really

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:16,840
difficult to the a fill in the table

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,899
that you saw before the different months

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:23,409
and it will also make a meaningful to

00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:26,500
correct for our Cleveland prediction

00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:29,140
perspiration because we all know how

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:32,760
much steam it actually happens our own

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:36,309
fault and how much was because the host

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,990
and the largest for the ventilation

00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:43,250
really is that if we like stay on you

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,380
because we expect a short pause and

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:51,600
there are many other busy views on the

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:54,990
system to make it a musician then didn't

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,020
we try to exchange messages with when I

00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:01,770
get a chance run is everybody i decided

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:04,110
not to drag to the host and we don't

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:11,480
know how to help solve that particular

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:14,309
issue and one to compare him in the face

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:18,870
stop on a stain on our table and from

00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:22,010
hitting the bottle there yeah well with

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:24,470
the exodus is or how long what should be

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:28,080
before we both are traveling to the host

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:32,340
and when we get back we still don't know

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,140
how much time it actually was we're

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:39,210
gonna have a really hard time and

00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:42,030
indistinct I'm absolutely right so on to

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,500
the second approach this is something

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,910
not we implemented question to the

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:51,150
husband lazy and Peele switching instead

00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:54,950
of saving it he's dead the memory when I

00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:59,160
switched from a program to get a haircut

00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:03,120
we simply keep all that in the end user

00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:07,170
registers and we give us a into memory

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,809
unless something else is yet orders

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:12,809
rebels from one of us or in a burger or

00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:16,170
something else is excellent do you get

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:20,720
paid in memory knowing what had happened

00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:24,420
he actually say it to take the money it

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,460
works very well in program stays on the

00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:30,710
swing appeal and continues running I'm

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:34,740
saving you the Skip boats in every store

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:38,309
but here you program it moved with

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:41,340
different that to you then as rental

00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:45,470
agency me I think you is to send a

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:48,840
message to perceive even asking for

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:53,070
yesterday be safe to memory and only

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:55,380
once that is gone second team

00:21:53,070 --> 00:22:01,110
look yeah Ian's dead and start reading

00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:03,509
program this is now buying these things

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,730
that we just got physical but the same

00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:09,929
here to impugn into a very deep clicked

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:12,990
it and program I were here to hear you

00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:16,620
mostly difference keep you again is not

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:22,860
running again and allows the first CPU

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:25,649
has been woken up take Tecna me and then

00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:30,980
seconds in view slower at state although

00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:33,450
every company into its own ministers and

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,789
it has a little bit of complications

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,940
into the FPU code which is something

00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:42,299
that in your really you're not life and

00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:48,389
it's not working having workers this

00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:54,840
benefit purchase virgin so it's great

00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:59,490
idea but I don't know how you think some

00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,559
of your actions that were related and it

00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:05,250
is seven years of benefits of the

00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:08,340
workloads and it was correct peter is

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:11,159
very strong language so maybe something

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:16,820
a little bit more generic most users and

00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:20,549
which ain't saying effects but I like to

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,590
buy the overhead is most of it is in it

00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:25,639
you cooked but we see there as a little

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:33,330
bit of overhead in this pendulum as well

00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:36,419
the orange that part so what if we try

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:39,450
to attack possible to with solution is

00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:47,039
with a moment he'll be more generic than

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:48,899
just busy you good few spies enough on

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:53,129
this rich cover that is hurting more

00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:56,269
things than just in here some of our

00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:59,850
manufacturers are working on very fast

00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:04,470
unwelcome nominee and in certain use

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:06,179
cases they use them as rocky first it's

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:13,139
essentially the speed of grammar

00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:15,539
and the hurdles ayos that in- is we

00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:22,409
abilify devices that take forever and

00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:26,129
alumni rapist we final request program

00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:29,549
go to sleep and at some point in the far

00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:34,710
future heartless lq the pio community

00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:36,929
and the program's welcome develop but if

00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,049
you have any vice in the several million

00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:46,799
operations second to let me complex

00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:49,200
which organization hey second use case

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,869
out there it has issues with contacts

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,610
purchased maybe he has an infrastructure

00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:57,869
it's possible that installed both cases

00:24:53,610 --> 00:25:00,299
and they will hopefully made it more

00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:04,019
acceptable for the go to Lymington

00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:07,049
current the idea is that instead of

00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:09,929
switching to the Islanders within an

00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:13,200
hour any task to be gone yeah I love

00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:17,759
that by calling a simple function in the

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:22,499
girl it can help reduce really avoiding

00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:27,690
context fish over a short sleeves and by

00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:30,360
doing this in specular and will allow us

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:33,840
to do the same things that I will pass

00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,210
to within the parentheses ski if there

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,070
is something else definitely see you

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:43,679
right now it is very rare sees us and it

00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,360
has nothing else to run later on it's

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,419
going to break this up and replace us

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,119
for something in reading is the room and

00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:55,529
begin eating a power-saving University

00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:59,580
be all things in have another task but

00:25:55,529 --> 00:26:01,730
if you're a message passing workload the

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:05,279
wing is NB skip on that switch overhead

00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:07,590
both of in transition from running idle

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:13,950
and all the way back to my doesn't know

00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:17,880
me and I'm working on some vote for this

00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:25,340
way now Bernama protection

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:28,950
as in Idaho function and structure

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:37,320
today's info on United or function and

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:39,300
we going oh that's it a the function

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,100
pointer the old function which is a

00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:45,170
little bit like using linking probably

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:48,660
have changed medical post images and

00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:51,780
that whole function does things that

00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,820
you've ever asked us or you can replace

00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:58,170
it with your own if you already know

00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:08,460
your sleep extremely short given the

00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:11,910
option is no go past stated needs peace

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,280
alien preemption if we act as nitrous

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:17,790
better and so the old is the one instead

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:21,660
then put in to make sure all the states

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:24,990
we have registered an abap you can

00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:29,790
reveal the other parts cpu probably safe

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:32,310
to memory luckily the colonel already

00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:36,030
has infrastructure does this it's

00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:40,110
probably pregnant fires a vm using this

00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:42,630
already and thurs ee the both

00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:46,280
interviewed resourcefulness that case

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:49,110
let us format in st mary's home and

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:52,860
function and multiples of a billion a

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:57,540
complete idiot SBP lock is open every 50

00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:00,450
people I hope it or any rats can also at

00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:04,500
this own wait here if you make it easy

00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:09,060
to wait back up by pc p.m. take on a

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:13,380
demonstration on us though this dog can

00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:15,840
stay the same was important it's better

00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,570
than a damaged to try and you can tell

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,440
you make on the beta version at least I

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,440
thinking small

00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:34,760
okay be a place the ring is the whole of

00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:38,000
status w jack the only thing that whole

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:45,110
buncha needs to check is didn't ask and

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:48,710
woken up and we mechanism she left

00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:51,740
because in the jet does state we can

00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:55,010
change your own first state to interrupt

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:59,710
asleep before all inaudible function and

00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:03,860
we can check whether we got let's take

00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:08,269
switchback club because prove all that

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:10,179
is if you make something else this is

00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:15,639
very generic way of implementing this

00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:15,639
the lower could use a mild all function

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:24,399
which is my making this in deforestation

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:26,450
and what if the another craft is current

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,320
position to do all the same things that

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:32,870
we do right now from context switching

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:40,909
if nothing I must run for we run like we

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:45,769
do nothing ago which is video workflow

00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:48,769
of effects fish with this code in C cpu

00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:52,010
state title in until the original thread

00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:57,049
runnable again but we really have to do

00:29:52,010 --> 00:30:02,000
is Mark to ask us whether and you know

00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:05,120
what it was noted at work that time we

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,620
do need to make sure that that is open

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:13,880
up on st. appeal we're still running the

00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:18,350
repair a few changes and basically is

00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:21,880
there any way to find logic for police

00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:26,029
casks that I should be ringing humans

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:28,309
and it might even result in the fellow

00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:32,270
colleton among enhance the park

00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:35,539
especially it's all they ask mr. onimous

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:38,690
will be you then receive a free ends

00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:41,749
this read it in same way that we always

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,759
them will be ready which

00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:46,850
point you he is like I save all your

00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:49,249
evil spell stuff happens but only happen

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:57,559
to something else be stable while you

00:30:49,249 --> 00:31:00,559
hide doesn't drain of us is of course if

00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,269
you're logging and for magic pants and

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:06,529
were close we look at for those systems

00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:09,609
do it seems my present eternity of

00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:13,909
claims we are in being of you like this

00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:20,210
and we can avoid doing lot of expensive

00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:23,200
things but yet used it and it's how many

00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:29,059
least alone infrastructure is in place

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:33,200
to switch the program but it doesn't

00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:37,159
rain very old in installation in I don't

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:40,009
ask this process chinese hero that's a

00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,629
real it'll go to the specular means i

00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:46,909
should probably head over to the colonel

00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:52,999
summit at some point five days that you

00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:56,659
guys are really blue ball but the latest

00:31:52,999 --> 00:32:01,849
issue with business instead of saving

00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:05,659
the date when we go idle and nothing

00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:08,899
else wants to see you we delay doing a

00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:12,019
very expensive operation but there's

00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:13,849
nobody else wanted see you there's

00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:19,299
nobody else is going to have to wait for

00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:22,940
us india used it when when it was become

00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:25,279
they were not over the time but there is

00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,109
a potential worst case here where we

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,289
going over a little bit so the other

00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:32,809
monster run and something else I'm onion

00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:35,149
because we first have to say deity users

00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:38,749
before were able to make switch the

00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:43,330
other toxic so we may need some

00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:45,859
heuristic in internal to see how often

00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,179
we switch back to the original terms

00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:54,720
first of how often we switched

00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:57,450
and do we have you safe lazy day or

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,100
early depending on what is playing on

00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:04,679
the other hand maybe we don't need is an

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:07,610
old I kind of work I didn't vote once I

00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:15,210
have more more code that's this place I

00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:17,279
love you what we're going to need then

00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,470
completely we interrupted presentation

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:23,490
is that message present were closed and

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:27,409
quite hard deep because every single

00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:33,929
month solutions the net worth have

00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:36,029
quarter discs and system is certainly

00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:42,080
not optimized very well switching with

00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:44,850
me when a maniacal wherever sister um

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:49,350
the source code changes that we need for

00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:52,200
this are very isolated Neil I to the

00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:57,119
rest of the system when he got changes

00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,950
in before the throne but it has a

00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:03,450
fundamental issues and is really not

00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:07,409
clear other than 1000 sold it is it is

00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:11,780
glitching it works very well but it is

00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:17,520
very super special purpose modification

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:21,089
to go that the people are very sensitive

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,540
about and have for the lot of time up

00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:27,629
and because i have the village in the

00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:34,079
worst place that I must not in IE she

00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:36,960
comes over the lazy context switching it

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,770
has multiple users are it is a

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,480
fundamental changes

00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:46,580
which will know that leads to all kinds

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:50,460
of life in the effects on this playlist

00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:54,929
but it's imported I think would be the

00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:57,420
most generic right now and probably my

00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:59,700
required to money in place of changes in

00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,760
the code this is what I'm playing with

00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:08,160
him and stay tuned to the fireworks

00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:10,170
ominous girl and that's what we need

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,390
some downsides I'm not looking different

00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,130
questions but if you have a suggestion

00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:23,570
for weather ideas are always problems

00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:32,400
that as well thank you there is still a

00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:34,619
very now the question is is there any

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:40,980
talk of hardware optimization drink

00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:43,859
performing an unheard-of moon and if we

00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:46,200
were to talk with Camilla inhale in each

00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:49,560
day it will probably take at least five

00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:53,040
years for one of our suggestions to show

00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:55,170
up in our turn and I think that we're

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,380
going to need a solution between now and

00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:00,690
in the way of course once we fix it in

00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:05,580
software then whatever need to do it in

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:09,619
hardware bit of a catch-22 there at this

00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,619
is very best and instantly saw words of

00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:33,890
Allah I guess whether or not we switched

00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:38,100
on the guest to the coast I mean idol

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:42,950
and I'm determined to buy I believe it's

00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:46,460
been removed Arians suppose an idol

00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:50,250
perimeter and when he gets it was vital

00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:51,380
it goes the whole construction and that

00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:55,050
point

00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:59,010
the art virus can be trapped to the nose

00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:04,280
I think this is a flag in the earthiness

00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:08,130
and we said other novices so yeah I

00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:13,140
questionable but the speech Disney fast

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:19,290
doesn't yes okay so have you happy

00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:24,360
workers you said that we don't know this

00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:27,060
is not true and also you cannot see

00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,470
whether the best changing every use

00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,880
dates are you know whether the guests

00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:42,780
usually a cubicle but that's me yes it's

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:48,300
little small country so tell us the

00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:50,430
guest I guess we could personalize this

00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:55,770
and have the guest Eleanor area in which

00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:59,310
used but it's not just yet either using

00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:03,560
those registers Oh of mssg instructions

00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:11,010
for example here is the same process and

00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:13,290
a lot of empathy and fans checks coming

00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:17,220
and virtual functions all those things

00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:19,680
like that users like so the chances of

00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:23,280
the radiation even used when we dealing

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:27,410
with workload that tense messages the

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,410
other programs actually point

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,970
other questions

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,750
