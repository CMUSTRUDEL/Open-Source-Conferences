hi everyone my name is Syria one and

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:20,220
from Red Hat ver q eating today I'm

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:25,710
going to show you some result of our

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:29,820
currently casting about NFV we use two

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:33,239
hosts for testing one is for to use to

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,340
run vm i and the other wise to run pakka

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:42,420
generator for the birdhouse we're on the

00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:47,070
vm we have 10 bite even at cart

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:50,309
and run the RT colonel and yet we

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,210
isolated the cpu for battle for lower

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:58,379
latency and we're used ovs DVD k and v

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:03,600
host user and multi queue and the

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:06,570
obvious davidic a bridge so we basically

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,200
configure to interface into the obvious

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:13,140
bridge one is interfaced EPT k 0 and the

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,430
otherwise deputy heavy host user 0 so

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:21,780
the typical k 0 is connected to the host

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:25,409
real card a network card and the TBT TV

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:29,520
host user 0 interface is connected to

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,549
the virtual machine and this is the

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,650
configuration of the test code a host

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:40,409
which is only install the moon gin which

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,630
is a package generator we don't care

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:47,369
whether you use Articuno or a regular

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:52,950
colonel it's the key point is it has 2

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:56,040
10 Gigabit Ethernet and the complete

00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,689
phone configuration of guests yes we use

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:05,909
the RT condo on the guests and one

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:10,110
bet huge pages and isolated the cpu and

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,930
when you install DVD k on the virtual

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:20,069
machine we ruin test pmts

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:23,280
cases and the way come paint and Casper

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:26,730
and vc POS fallout has PMD and one for

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:32,010
the main threat check here check it here

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:34,889
we use an m qs the last line for obsd

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:39,569
BDK which means for example i use for

00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:46,230
multi cues so i set the option and TP

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:50,220
DKR excuse for four and here we use 5v

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:54,349
scipios in the cast for for test PMT and

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:58,980
one for men thread here is the

00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:04,620
throughput way cut for 4 q's and nine

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:06,689
virtual night vista views for for peace

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,200
abuse is pinned to OBS threat and

00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:14,879
five-piece abuses is a site to cast so

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:20,400
we got the throughput about 11 million

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:24,870
PPS and we think is there a better

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:29,189
solution together better throughput we

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:32,939
try to use 8v CPUs pin 20 vs threat and

00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:36,900
it will say right click at fourteen

00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:43,379
point 88 million PBS which is a higher

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:45,989
rate so here's not nice we just want to

00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:50,099
know if you have any suggestions about

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:54,359
how to ping the pc pues too obvious

00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:57,780
threat is it should be for like four 4 3

00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:00,509
four 4 pc peels or for thread for eight

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,849
weeks of use any suggestion well opinion

00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:05,759
is welcome you can talk to me face to

00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:11,310
face i will be here at the POF section

00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:14,359
or just email me at x iy 1 at redhat.com

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,359
thank you

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,230
