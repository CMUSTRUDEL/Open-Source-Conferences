Title: [2016] QEMU Coroutines, Exposed by Jeff Cody
Publication date: 2016-09-06
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	Coroutines are an integral part of the QEMU block layer, providing a cooperative multi-tasking framework that largely obviates the need for callback functions. This allows the QEMU block layer to implemented a sequential, multi-threaded workflow, without the added complexity of preemption. This presentation will go over the QEMU coroutine implementation, how coroutines are used in the block layer, and the advantages of coroutines. And -- despite these advantages -- coroutines are not without their drawbacks, such as their own code complexity and unique debugging challenges. These drawbacks will also be discussed in the presentation.
