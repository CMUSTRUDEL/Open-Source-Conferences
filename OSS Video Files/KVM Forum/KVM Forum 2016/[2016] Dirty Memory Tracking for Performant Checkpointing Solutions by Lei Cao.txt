Title: [2016] Dirty Memory Tracking for Performant Checkpointing Solutions by Lei Cao
Publication date: 2016-09-05
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	There are bottlenecks and limitations in KVM that hamper the performance of a checkpoint/rollback system, namely use of large bitmaps to track dirty memory and lack of multi thread support due to mmu lock implementation. In this presentation, I will discuss a new dirty memory tracking mechanism that improves the performance of checkpoint/rollback implementations for commercial production. This new mechanism can also be used to improve the predictability of live migration of memory write intensive workloads.
