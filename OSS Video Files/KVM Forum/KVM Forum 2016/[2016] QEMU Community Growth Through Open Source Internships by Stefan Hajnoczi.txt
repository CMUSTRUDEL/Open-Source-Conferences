Title: [2016] QEMU Community Growth Through Open Source Internships by Stefan Hajnoczi
Publication date: 2016-09-02
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	QEMU began participating in the Google Summer of Code internship program in 2010 and has since expanded to Outreachy, a program aimed at underrepresented groups in open source. As QEMU enters its sixth year of open source internships, it's time to explain why it makes sense to participate and how community volunteers can successfully mentor remote interns.

Mentors from the QEMU community help interns with a 12-week full-time remote work project. Most project ideas are proposed by mentors and have multiple applicants. What makes a good internship project idea and how to select applicants who will become long-term members of the community are two fundamental questions that this presentation answers.

The aim of the presentation is to encourage even more participation and show how the time, effort, and money in these programs benefits interns, QEMU, and sponsors.

okay so I'm gonna talk about open source

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,740
internship programs have you guys seen

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,350
any people around here wearing google

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,390
Summer of Code t-shirts that's basically

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,400
what this talk is about why people in

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,779
funky t-shirts are taking over the open

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,650
source world so this is not a technical

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,180
talk most of toxic avium forum our

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:37,770
technical talks about new features and

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,590
kvm or in qemu but the reason i'm giving

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,050
this talk at kvm forum is because Q mu

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,370
as a project has already participated in

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,780
open-source internships for six years

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,460
that means a number of people from our

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,129
community have been mentors and have

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,410
participated and yet it's not something

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,190
we really talked about a lot it's

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,949
something that kind of happens

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,379
automatically there is a crew of mentors

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,809
who like to participate every year but I

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,909
want to present this in a more you know

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,040
open way in a more public way get a

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,420
little bit more attention to the wider

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,549
group not just the people who have

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,409
already been doing the mentoring not

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,380
only the people who are already aware of

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,570
it so that's really the point of this I

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,070
hope that some of you if your regular

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,900
contributors if you're active in the

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,369
community if you think this is a cool

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,409
thing and you want to get involved I

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,909
hope that after this presentation you

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,979
know you'll know more about it and and

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,680
and you'll be able to decide whether you

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,530
want to get involved some of you may be

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,560
eligible to participate as interns if

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,259
you're a student or there are some other

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,700
programs you know every internship

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,680
program has its own eligibility

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,450
requirements but you may be eligible so

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,820
this presentation will give you some

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,490
information about what it's like to be a

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,200
student and what you can expect and

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,299
finally by presenting this kind of

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,240
formally and having the slides and the

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,790
video out there we can capture what our

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,340
processes and how we participate in do

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,369
internships as qemu because up until now

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,750
it's never been really you know held

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,250
down and and present it okay so let's

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,050
start with what are open-source

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,520
internships

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:20,650
basically we're talking about full-time

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,830
paid remote work to participate you know

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:27,070
to work on a project in Q mu and LU bird

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,660
and kvm and so on there are a couple of

00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,670
internship programs that offer the

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,050
framework where we participate we

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,970
participate in google summer of code

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,100
google summer of code is the biggest

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,510
open source internship program it's been

00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,900
around the longest I think it's been

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:44,170
around since 2006 and we've participated

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,150
for six years we also do outreach II

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,910
originally outreach II started as

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,050
outreach program for women but since

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,240
then they've actually expanded their

00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,280
focus and now they're trying to cover

00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,140
more underrepresented groups in open

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,840
source to encourage people who

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,810
traditionally aren't you know

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,020
participating in open source so these

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,120
two internship programs are the ones

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,680
that we participate in and at this point

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,900
you might say hang on a second we're an

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,670
open source project why do we need

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,260
internship programs anyone can send a

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,260
patch anyone can get into the community

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,420
so why do we do this it makes no sense

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,180
but actually it does make sense so first

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25,270
of all because the interns who are

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,730
working on this get full-time paid work

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,920
they can really focus on something

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,320
that's not just a small bug fix a small

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,200
patch they can really focus on a kind of

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,720
medium-sized feature these programs run

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,160
12 weeks so that means 12 weeks of

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,290
full-time work so they can really do

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,000
something substantial so that's the

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,620
first thing because I don't know about

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,780
you guys but before I really got into

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,430
qemu what i would do is i would use some

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,320
tools i would dig into some open source

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,120
software every once in a while I would

00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,530
send that one off patch but I never

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,530
really got into a community because I

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,930
never really had a sizable thing to work

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,880
on and you know that's why I that's why

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,990
I kind of until I got to cuum you I

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,300
didn't really stay and stick around and

00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,670
so by giving people full-time work they

00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:13,720
can get real experience what it's like

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:15,610
to do open-source development the other

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,950
thing is that the interns are they have

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,660
a kind of privileged position because if

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,070
you just send patches to a mailing list

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,650
and hope that someone will review it

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,660
those people won't know you and they

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,320
might be busy so sometimes the

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,540
experience and

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,820
time it takes to get feedback is longer

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,640
than you'd like but if you are in an

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,770
open source internship program you have

00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,080
a mentor your mentor is your point of

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,540
contact with that project so with Q mu

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,680
or live part and they care about you

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,960
know making sure that you're making

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,750
progress they will help answer you

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,010
questions they might introduce you to

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,680
other maintained errs and people in the

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:54,670
community who you need to communicate

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,760
with so you really have a special role

00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:01,600
here and it's it's a great way to get

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,640
into open source development okay so why

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,190
do we do it as q mu what do we get out

00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,430
of it why do we participate so first of

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,260
all the hope is to get new contributors

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,910
and I'll show some of the names of the

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,410
people who participated in programs in

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,970
the past and you'll probably recognize

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,920
them because some people in our

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,710
community have started off as ji-suk

00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,350
students google Summer of Code and have

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,120
then you know moved on to work for some

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,420
of the companies here that are funding q

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,700
me and kvm development so we get new

00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,350
contributors by doing this and we get

00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,290
people with new ideas people haven't

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,880
been involved in Cuba for who have

00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,410
different technical backgrounds so it's

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,900
a nice way for us to kind of keep the

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:45,130
community healthy and active the other

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,900
thing we can do is we can raise the

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,550
profile of our community because keep in

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,830
mind these are people the people who

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,540
apply as interns are people who are

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,580
passionate about open source they want

00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,520
to get into open source and it's good

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,080
that they see qemu as one of the

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,660
projects they can work on on that list

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,660
it shows that we are you know healthy

00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,060
community that we are active and that we

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,350
welcome new contributors so I think it's

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,400
really good for us to do that because I

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,140
don't know if you've noticed but we

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,240
don't have a lot of marketing you don't

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,160
have a lot of outreach team you kind of

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,650
just exists and mainly we just you know

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,740
write code that's what we do we have a

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,110
Google+ page that's about it we we don't

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,370
do and much in terms of marketing this

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,260
is one of the ways we can get attention

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,820
okay another thing is that for the

00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,040
mentors for those of us from the

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,750
community who are acting as mentors it's

00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,000
a way for us to give back to open source

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,760
because all of us over the course of

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,220
contributing to QMI you getting involved

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,350
in

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,480
AVM or whatever we do there have been

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,510
people who have taken time to talk to us

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,720
to help explain you know how the code

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,770
works so that we can be productive there

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,540
have been people who reviewed our

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,100
patches or have introduced us to other

00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,660
people and gotten us into the community

00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,750
and this is our chance to do the same

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,500
thing by being a mentor you know you'll

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,480
be working with someone who's

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,880
enthusiastic but doesn't have you know

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,770
any previous background in this and you

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,840
can help them just the way people got

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,580
you in tukee me so that's a nice

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,490
experience and I find it very satisfying

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,350
as a mentor to do that and finally it is

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,720
fun to do google Summer of Code to be a

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,520
mentor to work with students and

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,170
although that sounds you know that

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,270
sounds pretty cliche it's actually true

00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,760
because all the mentors are volunteers

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,930
right so if it wasn't fun we wouldn't be

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,130
doing it so I've proven it all right by

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,140
the way if you guys have any questions

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:38,720
feel free to interrupt me anytime here's

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,340
our timeline this is what we've done the

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,220
first time we participated in google

00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,320
summer of code was 2010 and I think it

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,450
was Louise capitally know who organized

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,950
that so he kicked it off and we had four

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,050
interns the first year and we we

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,800
continued doing that and then we get to

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,320
2012 and that year we were not accepted

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,410
because you know Google provides a pool

00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,510
of funding and organizations like qm you

00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,440
can apply and that year we didn't get

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,180
accepted and that was really

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,020
disappointing because I was the one who

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,490
wrote the application form so I felt

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,900
pretty guilty I felt like I'd let people

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,419
down because I knew there was mentors

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,220
you know people who had wanted to mentor

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:18,919
students that year and they couldn't

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,990
because we didn't have any funding so

00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,760
when I talk to Google then they said

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,710
there wasn't really anything we did

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,390
wrong it was more that they that year

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,340
they wanted to allocate funding to new

00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,260
organizations organizations that hadn't

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,630
participated before and that we should

00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,760
keep trying so the next year we tried

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,169
again and in 2013 we got back in and

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,419
that time we got back in with more

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,219
interns than ever we had nine interns

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,950
that year and the other thing that was

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,350
new was that libvirt came along with us

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,089
so when you join one of these programs

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,430
there is a certain amount of

00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,110
administrative overhead and experience

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,160
of the process that you need in order to

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,579
have successful internship

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,250
and so what some some projects do like

00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:01,410
that year liberta this is instead of

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,769
applying as their own org they joined

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,300
qmu under the umbrella of q mu and so

00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:08,550
that way their mentors could kind of

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,889
participate without having to go through

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,389
the administrative overhead and have

00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,610
experience with how the process works

00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:16,439
and actually if you look at the end you

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,750
can see that what happened is that

00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:21,029
libvirt over the years their team of

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,189
mentors they got enough experience they

00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,839
grew they had enough students they you

00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:28,290
know they were just confident with the

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,149
whole thing and they now go and apply as

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,800
their own org so they've now forked off

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:33,560
from us again so now they are their own

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,589
independent board so that was very nice

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:42,000
so we've we've helped them you know join

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:44,430
as well let's see what else did we do so

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,439
then 2014 was our first outreach

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,199
previously we had only done google

00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:50,430
Summer of Code but in 2014 we did

00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:53,670
outreach you back then it was still

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:56,160
called outreach program for women the

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,019
one thing you might notice there even

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,550
though the format of outreach is very

00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,639
similar to google Summer of Code it's a

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,740
12-week paid internship so basically the

00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,779
same situation with a mentor and all of

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,540
that what is different is the funding

00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,339
model google Summer of Code google has a

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,519
pool of money that they're generously

00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,470
you know giving to students to work on

00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,790
open source projects outreach is

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,220
different outreach you provides a

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,040
platform for doing internships but you

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,959
need to find funding so we only had one

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,480
intern and that's because we're good at

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,310
coding we're not good at fundraising so

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,300
if any of you work for companies that

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:35,759
want to promote diversity then please

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,500
talk to me after this talk because it'd

00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,839
be great to get more funding so that we

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,189
can have more interns working on cumene

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,689
also through the outreach program okay

00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:47,250
the only thing I'll still say about the

00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:49,620
slide is that you know this year we're

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,600
doing outreach II we're doing g-shock we

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,379
have seven interns so things are still

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,029
going strong okay so this is nice this

00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,250
is a list of the people who have

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:01,079
participated over the the past six years

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,269
these are the names you might recognize

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:06,630
some of them the size is proportional to

00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:13,950
how many commits they have in q mu kvm

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:16,770
and Lewbert okay I made you some

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,450
O'Reilly fake book covers so hope you

00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,920
enjoy them basically the next part of

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,010
this presentation I'm just going to talk

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,570
a little bit more about how these

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,400
internship programs work what the

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:30,240
different phases are so that you

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,800
understand how it runs okay so the first

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,180
thing is let's talk about the roles

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,370
because I have thrown out some of the

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,980
terminology without really explaining it

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,230
so you know I've mentioned mentors and

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,510
the internship programs but basically

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,340
the way it works is that we have

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,550
internship programs like google Summer

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,260
of Code and outreach II now some open

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,810
source projects like I think gnome I

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,460
can't remember they don't use they don't

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,320
need to use google Summer of Code they

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,230
just run their own program there are

00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,900
some you know organizations that do that

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,910
but by doing that they take on a load of

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,530
extra work because what they need to do

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,300
is they need to have contracts with the

00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,490
students legal contracts you know for

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,790
the work they need to do handle the

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:15,060
payments the the money that that is paid

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,620
to the interns and so by participating

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,410
in google Summer of Code and outreach II

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,600
we offload that we outsource that we

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,610
don't need to handle the legal issues we

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,630
don't need to spend time on it so that's

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,520
one of the benefits we get from

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,110
participating in internship programs

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,900
another thing that's great about

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:34,530
internship programs is that they are a

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:36,300
platform and they get a lot more

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,040
attention a lot of computer science

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,050
students know about google Summer of

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,030
Code they may not know that qemu is

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,290
participating that year but they know

00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,670
about google summer of code so they go

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,260
to the website and see the list of

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,640
organizations and CQ me and they click

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,370
on it and then they see what we're

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,380
offering so if imagine we ran our own

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,030
program how would we get as much

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,740
attention as google summer of code to

00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,810
get all these excellent students to

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,120
apply well we wouldn't because we suck

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,860
at marketing so so this is one of the

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,630
benefits of participating in an

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,610
internship program as we get this

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:09,930
platform and we get the the marketing

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:12,120
the brand for free okay and then we have

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,380
the intern the person who's committed to

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,410
doing this project and does their

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:19,529
full-time paid internship they can be

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:21,360
anywhere around the world pretty much

00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,980
and it's remote work just like any other

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,839
member of the community it's not the

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,550
case that they have to be in an office

00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,920
with their mentor or anything like that

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,410
most students do not have face to face

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,209
you know real life contact with a mentor

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,860
at all instead it's just done like all

00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:36,839
the other regular open source

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,519
development that we do on mailing lists

00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:43,800
on IRC and so on okay then there's the

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,350
mentor the mentor is someone from our

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,610
community a regular contributor someone

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,499
who has experience with the development

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,889
process and is able to you know guide

00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:53,910
someone else through it as well and you

00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:55,649
know they help their intern but they

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,899
also evaluate them so they make sure

00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:00,800
that they stay on track and that they're

00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,939
doing what they promised they would do

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,439
and then finally there's the

00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:05,999
organization administrator I've been

00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:10,170
doing that for the past few years and

00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:11,999
basically what i do is i apply with

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,189
google Summer of Code I talked to the

00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:18,569
outreach II folks I make sure that you

00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:20,519
know we get accepted and then I organize

00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:23,970
the mentors you know I invite people to

00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:27,600
participate and be mentors and you know

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:33,089
I help out with administrative stuff any

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:35,250
questions okay I'll move on so we've

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:37,589
learned about the roles but how does the

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,029
program flow what's the timeline so the

00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:41,160
basic idea is that there's three phases

00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:43,230
there is the application phase there's

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,209
the community bonding period and then

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,589
there's the coding face the coding phase

00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:48,000
is what you think about it's where the

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,399
actual work happens it's where the

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,990
internship you know where the the intern

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,970
is working on their project and the

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,779
mentor is kind of there in order to

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,339
support the intern but the application

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,809
phase is actually the busiest phase in

00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,179
the most critical phase because that's

00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:05,100
when all these application forms from

00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:06,689
interns are coming in from candidates

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,519
people who want to become interns and

00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:10,290
that's when the mentors have to scramble

00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:15,149
and figure out who they want to work

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:17,100
with that year let's see the community

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,970
bonding period is actually the time in

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,679
between that's after the after the

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,269
accepted interns have been announced but

00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,860
before the coding begins and that's just

00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:27,600
because of the timeline of the program

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,370
typically the coding happens in the

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,929
summer so that university students have

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,820
a summer break and can focus on this

00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,770
full-time

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,420
and so doing the community bonding

00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,970
period what we usually do is we

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,460
encourage the interns to subscribe to

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,870
the mailing lists to get on IRC to try

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,340
building the code and already look

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,500
around so they're familiar with it that

00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,080
way once the coding starts they're ready

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:51,410
to go and they can write patches and so

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:55,400
on Paulo and several other people have

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:57,770
been keeping a bite sized tasks wiki

00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,680
page of today which is a great starting

00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:03,380
point for small qemu tasks that

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,030
newcomers can do and so that's sometimes

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,040
something that people who have time

00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,630
during the community bonding period do

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,280
is they already practice you know

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,840
getting patches upstream even if it's

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,670
not working on their project they're

00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,860
solving you know small problems doing

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:22,430
some refactorings that we've suggested

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:24,380
so that works well okay I'm going to run

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,410
through the kind of things that mentors

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,090
do talk first about the application

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,010
phase so during the application phase I

00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,960
just said that it's it's basically the

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,220
busiest phase of the program that's

00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,060
actually where mentors have to do the

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,890
most work and what men towards do is

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,600
they come up with a list of project

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,710
ideas they'd be willing to mentor for

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,270
some people that's only one thing

00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,860
they're interested in mentoring one

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,840
thing other people have a bunch of ideas

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,490
and then they'll see where the strongest

00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,110
candidate is and they choose one or two

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,560
and they'll take on those projects in

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,970
the summer so yeah so our mentors come

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,300
up with a list of project ideas and

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,130
these are the ideas that candidates will

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,960
see when they're browsing you know our

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,630
wiki page and seeing what they can get

00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,520
involved in sometimes we get candidates

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,310
who have custom ideas and who say well

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,480
actually I don't care about the

00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,860
suggested ideas I have my own thing I

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,839
have my pet feature that I really want

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,910
to do and that's a little bit more

00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,860
challenging because they will then need

00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,170
to find someone from the community who's

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,390
willing to step up and mentor them so if

00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,220
it's a very nice or exotic project that

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,680
no one has experienced in no one wants

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,090
to mentor they might be out of luck they

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,220
might have to go back and say I'm going

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,630
to take a predefined project idea but I

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,940
just wanted to mention it that that's

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,560
possible as well and that is kind of

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,980
cool we've done some of those over the

00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,830
years so what happens is that we have

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,630
these project ideas up there people are

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,300
browsing the wiki

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,460
they apply and before they apply to get

00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,380
in touch with the mentor and they will

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,400
start discussing the project dia because

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,320
what they want to do is they want to

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,240
fill out an application form and come up

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,820
with a rough project plan where they say

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,770
okay in the first two weeks I'll solve

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,330
this task and then I'll do this you know

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,500
they they need to show that they have

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,500
some kind of plan in mind for how

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,380
they're going to tackle their project so

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,580
this is the phase where as a mentor

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,820
you're answering questions about the

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:16,220
project idea you're helping you know

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,680
helping these applicants figure out how

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,000
they're going to solve the problem and

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,340
in the back of your mind you're kind of

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,960
evaluating them in deciding which one do

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,200
I want to select which one do I want to

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,970
work with this summer okay and then the

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,920
next step is we interview the top

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,480
candidates so once we've been in touch

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,220
with them a little bit we get a feel for

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,510
which ones are the ones we most likely

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,730
want to work with we invite them for

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,890
interviews it's just an IRC interview

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,020
and I'll go into detail a little bit

00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,180
more on that but that's what really

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,100
gives us a depth to decide who is the

00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,470
right fit who do we want to work with

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,720
and if we found someone to work with and

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,900
you know that's how we end the

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,400
application phase we select an intern

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,840
and it's better not to select any intern

00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,000
if you didn't get any really good

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,130
candidates because if you have someone

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,240
who's who's not a right fit then you

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,650
still have to support them throughout

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,900
you know there's twelve week internship

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,490
so it's better to really only do it if

00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:12,860
you're confident and you're happy with

00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:14,570
the candidates you have okay so one

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,620
interesting thing the key input here the

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,180
key ingredient is obviously these

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,550
project ideas that people are going to

00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,290
apply for and over the years we've kind

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,390
of learned what works well as a project

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,250
idea and what doesn't work well as a

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,070
project idea I think there's a spectrum

00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,470
of you know project ideas some of them

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,510
might be too easy and not really worth

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,000
the 12-week project that these

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,410
internships need to fit into some of

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,390
them are too risky or even impossible

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,330
because they're just too hard or involve

00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:43,340
too much you know cross community work

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:46,310
and it's just not possible to do them in

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,190
12 weeks it really depends on the

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,450
strength of the intern right some

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,310
interns have a lot of background

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,810
knowledge already and they'll be able to

00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,730
tackle harder problems so for them

00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,650
something that's challenging but good is

00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,160
something that might be impossible for

00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,280
someone who

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,600
was very new and so it's not just the

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,700
project idea that depends on the intern

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,140
but there's a couple of attributes I

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,240
think we found over the years that are

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,060
important to make these project ideas

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,640
solid give interns good projects to work

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,530
on first thing it has to be a

00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,260
well-defined project idea that just

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,700
means it has to have scope right it has

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,280
to have an end to the project because if

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,260
you got a 12 week project you want to be

00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,600
able to come up with kind of plan and

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,280
know when you're done so an example of

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,310
this would be implementing a new

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,930
emulated device in kuna because you can

00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,810
get hardware data sheet and you can get

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:38,150
the registers and you'll know when

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:40,250
you're done right there's a finite list

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,350
of features and things on there and you

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,790
can implement them an example is

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,470
something that's not well defined would

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,180
be maybe a performance investigation

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,380
saying Oh networking is slow let's just

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,080
have the student you know mess around

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,760
for 12 weeks and try to figure out where

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,950
the bottleneck is and optimize it and

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,930
get the patches upstream that's unlikely

00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,160
to go well especially if the person

00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,740
doesn't have a lot of previous

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,150
experience in virtualized networking you

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,120
know they might not even know where to

00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:06,680
look so that's not well defined so it's

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,110
better to have well-defined project

00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,150
ideas they also have to be

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,150
self-contained so it would be unfair to

00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,560
give a project to someone that depends

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,330
on other code that's in flight and

00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,940
hasn't been merged yet you know their

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,980
whole project could be basically not

00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,230
successful not complete simply because

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,510
of things outside of their control we

00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,580
want people to have project ideas that

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,050
they can drive themselves project ideas

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,820
were there in control right their

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,020
destiny you know they're in full control

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,330
of your destiny they don't have to wait

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,000
for you know other other people and

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,620
things like that because that tends to

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,120
slow them down and when you only have 12

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,880
weeks you really need to make sure that

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,120
you can you can complete the project

00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,890
start to finish this is an obvious one

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,840
it should be uncontroversial the project

00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,580
idea should not be something where the

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,110
intern is working for a few weeks start

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,880
sending patches and that a community

00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,530
says no way we're not going to hurt this

00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,210
that would be unfair that would be a

00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,410
very bad experience and so we always

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,110
like to choose things that are just

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,580
obvious improvements to qemu things that

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,100
are not going to get the intern in

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,870
trouble because remember this is someone

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,310
who doesn't have a lot of background so

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,210
if you're expecting to get into a flame

00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,130
war and

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,140
make technical arguments to justify the

00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,360
existence of their project that's pretty

00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,100
harsh so instead we try to do things

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,820
that are just obvious improvements those

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:25,399
are good project ideas and the final

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,659
thing that makes makes a nice project

00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:29,360
idea is to do something that's

00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:31,730
incremental where no matter how far they

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,320
get whether they exceed the scope of

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,029
their project or whether they actually

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,250
don't make it all the way to where they

00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:39,320
said they would you still have

00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,450
deliverables you still have things that

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,390
get merged one thing that comes to mind

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:47,029
is that recently there's been work on

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,429
modularizing pieces of Q mu so they can

00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:51,289
be in their own shared libraries like

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:52,640
the block drivers and if you have a

00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:54,770
project like that and you say i'm going

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,210
to try to modular as a block drivers you

00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,770
don't have to module eyes all of them if

00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,890
you don't make it towards the end say

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,330
you've done cluster and SEF you know you

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,159
put them into their own block drivers

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,169
that each one of those is a useful piece

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,299
of work it's not like a big bang

00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:09,919
approach project where if you don't

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:12,200
complete hundred percent of it that

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,820
feature won't exist at all you know so

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,190
it's good to have incremental projects

00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,929
where we can be flexible about how long

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,909
those projects say so these are the kind

00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,980
of things that I think are important for

00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:24,320
having solid project ideas that will

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:29,149
give both the men are and the intern a

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,399
good experience okay I'm going to talk

00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:33,909
about interviews and coding exercises

00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:36,260
are notorious for basically being

00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:41,630
arbitrary and unfair and stuff like that

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:43,880
so we try not to do that so during the

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:47,120
application phase when candidates are

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,279
applying mentors will interview the top

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,409
candidates in order to kind of really

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,240
figure out is this the person I want to

00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:54,500
accept as an intern for this year and

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,020
the way we do that would you do that

00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:01,010
with an interview it consists of two

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,539
parts the coding exercise and the

00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,010
discussion and the discussion follows

00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:05,929
from the coding exercise so we start

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,309
with the coding exercise and the point

00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:11,120
of the exercise is not to be a trick

00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:12,200
question it's not to check whether they

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,210
read their introduction to algorithms

00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,770
book and they can quickly code up you

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,370
know a splay tree or something like that

00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:21,200
it's it's simply about does this person

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:24,530
know how to write production quality

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,480
code code that we could merge into q mu

00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,040
and the reason for this is remember this

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,110
is only a 12-week project we don't

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,330
really have time to teach people how to

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,940
code they already need to be fluent and

00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,530
so the coding exercise we do our kind of

00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,580
real-world problems not trick problems

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,900
they have a little bit of memory

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,430
management a little bit of pointers a

00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,050
little bit error handling basically

00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,700
enough of that stuff so we can tell is

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,250
this a person who just had a single

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,900
University module where they use C and

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,250
they think they know see but there's

00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,230
going to be a ton of buffer overflows

00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,820
and bugs in their code or is this

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,380
someone who really has experienced and

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,120
can write code where we'd be confident

00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,950
in merging it into qemu and accepting

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,160
their work so that's the point of the

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,300
coding exercise that leads into the

00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,880
discussion once they complete the

00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,670
discussion we go on we look at their

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,500
code we ask some questions about what

00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,750
their solution that they've come up with

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,990
and so we can begin to see how do they

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:17,830
react to a code review how do they think

00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:19,970
about their code we can ask them to

00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,200
expand the requirements of the original

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,690
problem and we can ask them how would

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,790
you extend the how would you extend your

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,490
solution if the input was four gigabytes

00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,810
instead of you know just a tiny list how

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,700
would it affect the performance we can

00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:35,510
start to drill down and understand how

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,510
deep is their technical ability another

00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,370
good thing that we often talk about is

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:42,170
their own personal and hobby projects

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:46,460
especially with google Summer of Code

00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:47,780
you know University students we have

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,520
some of the we have some really

00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,750
passionate people applying we have some

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,150
really talented people applying they've

00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,100
done a lot of hobby projects so it's a

00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,480
good way to talk to them and find out

00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,220
about something that they're an expert

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,570
in and see what technical problems

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,840
they've solved in the past even though

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,480
they haven't maybe had real jobs a lot

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,100
of them have some cool emulator projects

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,750
or OS kernels that they've played with

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:13,010
or things like that so it's always fun

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:14,330
to talk about that and get an idea the

00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,160
final thing we talked about in an

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,720
interview is open source experience and

00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,720
we're not looking for people who are

00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,950
already contributing a lot to open

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,510
source because you know they wouldn't

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,620
really need to to try and do something

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,020
like google Summer of Code of course

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,150
they were there the welcome to do it but

00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,950
what we want to see is whether people

00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,020
have an affinity with open source

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,580
because if someone is not passionate

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,080
about open source then they're basically

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,639
just treating this as a summer job they

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,950
just want you know to do

00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:41,779
an interesting project to get money and

00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,219
to move on but that's not what we want

00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:45,229
we want someone who's passionate about

00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:48,739
open source someone who wants to join

00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:50,869
qemu and join labert and join kvm so

00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:52,909
that's why you know it's good to find

00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:56,089
out what their experiences and and what

00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:58,549
they're interested in an open source and

00:26:56,089 --> 00:27:02,269
that's about it I mean we give we give

00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:04,249
the intern you know chances as well to

00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:06,709
ask any questions that they have about

00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:08,359
the program and that's the interview and

00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:10,549
after that the mentors you know have a

00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:14,570
pretty firm idea of who it is they want

00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:15,950
to work with that summer okay so then we

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,589
can move on to the coding phase what do

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,359
mentors do during the coding phase

00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:22,700
during the coding phase it's pretty

00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:26,209
simple they set up regular meetings with

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,289
their intern and we found this to be

00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:31,609
very important i'm going to talk about

00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:33,229
it a little bit in a second and you know

00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:35,269
it's important for the mentor obviously

00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:38,269
to always be reviewing the interns

00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:40,489
patches quickly because it's only 12

00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:42,559
weeks long and if the intern gets you

00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:44,629
know if code review upstream takes a

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,119
long time then the project will be

00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:50,629
delayed so putting an extra effort there

00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:52,639
is also important usually we say the

00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:54,619
time commitment is is around five hours

00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:58,219
a week for a mentor maybe a little bit

00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:59,299
less it depends on the project yeah and

00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:01,849
then the other thing is just answering

00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:03,649
questions that come up from the intern

00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:05,539
you know if the Internet's stuck helping

00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:07,039
them sometimes helping them debug

00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:09,109
sometimes literally sitting down and

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,459
saying okay let's let's debug this or

00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:12,469
I'll try to reproduce this bug you're

00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:14,239
seeing that we can't explain and that's

00:28:12,469 --> 00:28:18,739
it you know it's just working together

00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:20,209
on code okay I'll talk a little bit

00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,679
about the the meetings that I mentioned

00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:23,829
because a lot of people don't like

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,450
meetings we have too many meetings but

00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:29,209
we have actually found that it is very

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:32,179
important in these remote it work

00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:34,549
projects with interns to have a regular

00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,139
meeting because pretty much every single

00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:37,489
time where a project failed and have

00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:39,950
failed in the past we've done this for

00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:42,229
six years one of the elements has been

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,059
lack of communication we couldn't get

00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:45,709
hold of the intern we couldn't get hold

00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,749
of the mentor and because of that

00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:50,569
thing's derailed to a point where we

00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:51,500
couldn't save the project sometimes even

00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:54,110
in trivial ways

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,360
the one example have is a couple of

00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,010
years ago there was a deadline for

00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,860
submitting what's called the midterm

00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:03,170
evaluation it's part of the internship

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,700
program that you have to go online to

00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:07,640
like a web form and just fill out

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:11,390
essentially a multiple-choice form that

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,610
just covers your progress you know a

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,830
student fills it out to evaluate their

00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,290
own progress and their mentor the mentor

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:21,860
fills it out in order to evaluate their

00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:23,540
students progress what happened is that

00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,520
someone went on like a camping trip or a

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:29,030
fishing trip the intern disappeared for

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,120
a few days forgot about this deadline

00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:34,310
and because we didn't have regular

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,630
communication going you know and the

00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,820
intern was basically allowed to just

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,230
roam free and do whatever there was no

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,300
one there to remind them oh by the way

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,610
next week you better submit this and by

00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,470
the time they got back the internship

00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,790
program not us not the mentor not me but

00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,280
the internship program had already seen

00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,750
that they'd missed the deadline and they

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,910
were not willing to compromise it's they

00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,350
said you're out you failed and when I

00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:56,330
analyzed that I thought back I was like

00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,520
man if we had just communicated

00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:00,260
regularly we could have avoided this

00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,730
silly thing and this person was capable

00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,320
they weren't bad at their project they

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,450
were doing a good job shouldn't have

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,520
happened so yeah that's why we do weekly

00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,840
meetings it also means that if the

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,180
intern gets stuck and isn't making

00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,800
progress the maximum delay they can hit

00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,000
is one week and after that you know

00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,200
they'll have their weekly meeting or

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,400
mentor will get them back on track okay

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,900
I think that's it another trick that we

00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,580
use one thing we have found over the

00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,460
years that helps a lot is having not

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,190
just one mentor with one intern instead

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,070
we Co mentor we get two mentors for one

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,200
intern so this helps a lot because of

00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,730
time zones and availability if the

00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,590
mentor is busy with work they might not

00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,150
be responding quickly enough and now the

00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,190
intern is stuck and is waiting and needs

00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:46,070
help and things like that and so you can

00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,710
reduce the stress on the mentors you

00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:51,800
know you can increase the response time

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:55,010
or decrease the response is what we want

00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,480
to do by having you know two mentors so

00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,860
that maybe if one of them is offline

00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,750
maybe at least the other one is online

00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,520
so that's one thing we do and it's also

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,230
a good way to get new mentors in people

00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,310
who want to join but who say I don't

00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:08,000
know if I want to respond

00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:09,950
for working 12 weeks with someone you

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,330
know or I want to go on vacation I want

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,800
to be away on holiday for a few days so

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,330
if we comment or we can solve these

00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,650
problems so that's something we've we've

00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:19,820
learned over the years it makes our

00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,870
projects more successful okay how to

00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,060
become a mentor what are the

00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,950
requirements the main thing is you need

00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,210
to be a regular contributor to cuum you

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,370
have to be somehow active in the

00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,100
community so that you have experience

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,240
with the open source process and you

00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,220
could guide someone else through that

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,670
you have to be willing to spend about

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:40,580
five hours a week on the internship

00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:42,050
program and basically what you do is you

00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,970
come up with project ideas things in

00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,290
your area that you'd like to mentor

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:48,860
you'd like to have someone working on

00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:50,480
and there are two times so either we can

00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,670
do google summer of code or can do

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,280
outreach e so the times are februari in

00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:57,710
September when I send out emails to the

00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,800
mailing list and I invite people to

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,810
volunteer as mentors but if you want you

00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,000
can also just contact me directly and

00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:07,400
I'll keep a note of it and let you know

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:13,040
when the next round of internships

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:15,110
program starts okay that's about all I

00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:18,890
had I've posted a bunch of links to

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:23,660
resources guides on you know how to how

00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:25,970
to be a mentor and also our own wiki

00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:28,820
pages so you can see past years what

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,920
sort of projects have we done things

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:33,910
like that so feel free to explore that

00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,910
are there any questions

00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,409
yeah that's okay

00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:29,990
okay yeah so the question was I said

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,850
that project ideas you know there's kind

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,260
of a spectrum of project ideas and some

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,930
of the project ideas could be too risky

00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,630
or even impossible one of the factors is

00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,980
whether there are dependencies whether

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,350
this project is self-contained so I

00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,910
think the question was you know if you

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,350
have a project that needs to touch for

00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,860
example multiple layers multiple

00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:50,690
projects like Lewbert and qemu you know

00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,310
those are more complicated projects it

00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,800
could be dependencies can can those be

00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:58,850
done and the answer is yes and we do do

00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,140
them it just depends on the candidate it

00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,270
just depends on the people who are

00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,960
applying whether you find someone who

00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:07,880
has the ability this year Alex mentioned

00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,060
this in the keynote this year I'm

00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,890
entered a project that actually involved

00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,440
touching a lot of components it involved

00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:18,110
adding a new kernel module to linux it

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,169
involved modifying TCP dump and

00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:22,970
Wireshark so that person he really dive

00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:26,000
in and he worked with multiple

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:27,649
communities but I considered it an

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,050
advanced project and when I interviewed

00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:31,760
the candidates for that project I was

00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,730
careful to only pick someone who I could

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,280
sense is really able to do that because

00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:41,260
that's that that takes a lot more work

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,260
than just working on one thing in qemu

00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,770
you

00:34:53,429 --> 00:35:02,550
I'm not sure if I understand the

00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:02,550
question uh-huh uh-huh

00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,260
yes absolutely so the question is if you

00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,240
have ideas for project ideas things

00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,800
you'd like to either be a mentorian or

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,380
maybe even just suggest this project

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,350
ideas absolutely be happy and this isn't

00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:26,110
you know super strict it's a spectrum

00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:28,630
and we try to get a good fit but I'm

00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:32,500
happy to talk to talk to you offline

00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:37,780
about project ideas okay are there any

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:40,050
other questions all right thank you very

00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,050
