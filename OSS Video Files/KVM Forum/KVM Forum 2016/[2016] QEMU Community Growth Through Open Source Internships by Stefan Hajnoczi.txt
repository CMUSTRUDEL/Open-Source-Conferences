Title: [2016] QEMU Community Growth Through Open Source Internships by Stefan Hajnoczi

Description: 
	QEMU began participating in the Google Summer of Code internship program in 2010 and has since expanded to Outreachy, a program aimed at underrepresented groups in open source. As QEMU enters its sixth year of open source internships, it's time to explain why it makes sense to participate and how community volunteers can successfully mentor remote interns.

Mentors from the QEMU community help interns with a 12-week full-time remote work project. Most project ideas are proposed by mentors and have multiple applicants. What makes a good internship project idea and how to select applicants who will become long-term members of the community are two fundamental questions that this presentation answers.

The aim of the presentation is to encourage even more participation and show how the time, effort, and money in these programs benefits interns, QEMU, and sponsors.
