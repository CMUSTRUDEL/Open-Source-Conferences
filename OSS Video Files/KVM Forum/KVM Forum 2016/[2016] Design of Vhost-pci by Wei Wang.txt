Description: 
	Current vhost-user based backend designs for virtio-net devices present scaling challenges, as communication intensive applications (e.g. virtual network functions) running in VMs start to stress this centralized design and resources assigned to it. vhost-pci offers a protected and point-to-point based inter-VM communication mechanism and we present a comprehensive design of vhost-pci in this talk. A VM with a vhost-pci device is able to copy data to another VM’s memory directly. The vhost-pci design is further extended to support communicating to multiple VM destinations.
The vhost-pci based inter-VM communication framework consists of a vhost-pci device, its driver, and an extension to the vhost-user/DPDK to set up the path between VMs. Initial results demonstrate desired scaling advantages due to vhost-pci’s decentralized approach to inter-VM communication.
