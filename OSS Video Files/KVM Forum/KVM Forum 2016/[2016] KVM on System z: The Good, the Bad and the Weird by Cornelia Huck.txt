Title: [2016] KVM on System z: The Good, the Bad and the Weird by Cornelia Huck
Publication date: 2016-09-13
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	System z aka s390x has been the second architecture supported by KVM, and it has been quite a way since then. This talk will examine how we dealt with the advantages and the pecularities of System z: What we have an instruction for, where we'd like to travel back in time to fix the interface, and where we just have to be different. You may also learn some new acronyms along the way.
