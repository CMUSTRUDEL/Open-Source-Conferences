Title: [2016] CPU Hotplug Support in QEMU by Bharata Rao & David Gibson
Publication date: 2016-09-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	CPU hotplug allows virtual CPUs to be added to, or removed from a running KVM guest. This can be used to scale the guest's compute capacity on demand in cloud environments.

CPU hotplug has been available for some time on x86 systems. However, the approach used there doesn't generalize well to other platforms. There has been an ongoing effort to design a general infrastructure for CPU hotplug in QEMU and, in particular, common management interface semantics usable on all platforms.

This talk will cover the challenges of supporting CPU hotplug in qemu, and highlight which areas do and don't yet have consensus on design. In particular it will discuss the proposed scheme implemented on Power and x86 based on a combination of generic device_add/device_del based hotplug and a new QMP interface for use by management layers.
