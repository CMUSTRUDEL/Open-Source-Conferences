Title: [2016] Vhost with Guest vIOMMU by Peter Xu & Wei Xu

Description: 
	Vhost is the technique used in QEMU/KVM to accelerate IOs for virtio devices, so that guest IOs can be handled without trapping into QEMU userspace. While vhost boosts guest block/network performance, it also brings security issues considering it is (before this work) bypassing protection of vIOMMUs. This becomes a more critical issue for NFV scenarios, in which user-space drivers are vastly used. A problematic user space driver inside guest can directly corrupt guest kernel in no time. In this presentation, Jason Wang (Wei Xu as presenter) and Peter Xu will propose a solution to add guest vIOMMU protection for vhost devices, and some performance numbers.
