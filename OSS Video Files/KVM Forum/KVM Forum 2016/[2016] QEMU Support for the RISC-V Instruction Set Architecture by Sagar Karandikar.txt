Title: [2016] QEMU Support for the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture by Sagar Karandikar
Publication date: 2016-09-08
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	RISC-V is a new instruction set architecture originally designed to support computer architecture research and education at UC Berkeley. RISC-V is now set to become a standard open architecture for industry implementations under the governance of the RISC-V Foundation.

This talk will summarize the benefits of RISC-V and open ISAs for the open-source systems-software community. The first section of the talk will focus on the draft RISC-V privileged specification, including the RISC-V vision for cleaner abstraction between hardware, hypervisors, and operating systems.

The talk will also discuss my experience bringing up RISC-V emulation support in QEMU, including adding architectural support, experimental devices, and fuzz testing against Spike, the “golden reference” RISC-V simulator. The talk will conclude by outlining opportunities to contribute to RISC-V ISA support in QEMU.
