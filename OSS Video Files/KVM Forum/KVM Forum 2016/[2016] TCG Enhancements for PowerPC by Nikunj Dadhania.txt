Title: [2016] TCG Enhancements for PowerPC by Nikunj Dadhania

Description: 
	QEMU allows for emulating different target architectures using the TCG mode. TCG
mode has been effectively used for validating pre-silicon systems. Developers
have often used QEMU TCG to develop application stack before actually deploying
them on real target architectures. Even though application development with TCG
can be slow, the non-availability of early hardware is often a compelling reason
to use TCG.

This talk will focus on some of the enhancements that are in progress to support
PowerPC architecture better in QEMU TCG mode. This includes the new PowerNV
platform, support for upcoming POWER9 processor and its ISA. We will also look
at some of the performance enhancements like multi-threaded TCG support for
PowerPC.
