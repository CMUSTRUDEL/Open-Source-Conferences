Description: 
	NFV usages poses stringent requirements on KVM in terms of real time and live migration. This presentation is an update about the progress we have made for these requirements.
We have to reduce the interrupt latency so as to speed up packet forwarding. By utilizing and enhancing the real time Linux kernel, reducing the VMX cost, we reduced the cyclic test result from 27 to 11 us, device interrupt handling latency from 49us to less than 10 us. 
We have come up with a bunch of innovation approaches that improve the performance of live migration significantly. We shortened the live migration duration from 2.3s to 700ms while keeping the VM down time lower than 7ms, and reduced the network traffic by about more than 60% in some typical cases. 
In this talk, Yunhong & Liang will share their experience for real time optimization, and introduce the technical details for live migration optimization.
