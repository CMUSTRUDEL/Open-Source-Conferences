Title: Real Time and Fast Live Migration Update for NFV by Liang Li
Publication date: 2016-09-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	NFV usages poses stringent requirements on KVM in terms of real time and live migration. This presentation is an update about the progress we have made for these requirements.
We have to reduce the interrupt latency so as to speed up packet forwarding. By utilizing and enhancing the real time Linux kernel, reducing the VMX cost, we reduced the cyclic test result from 27 to 11 us, device interrupt handling latency from 49us to less than 10 us. 
We have come up with a bunch of innovation approaches that improve the performance of live migration significantly. We shortened the live migration duration from 2.3s to 700ms while keeping the VM down time lower than 7ms, and reduced the network traffic by about more than 60% in some typical cases. 
In this talk, Yunhong & Liang will share their experience for real time optimization, and introduce the technical details for live migration optimization.

hello everyone my name is Asha Warren

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:21,300
and I'm working for Utah originates his

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,960
topic is a contributed by Nina and H on

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,150
your home but due to some reasons she

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,840
cannot occur here so I'm a twins

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,390
representation you stand over then this

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,730
topic is about a real tan and the first

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,329
lampur issue update for metalworking

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:42,680
progression ization as we know we attend

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:46,140
is a key performance for NF we and

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,420
lambda she can be used to to penance to

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,149
walk a lot between multiple computer

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,399
note and also ella can be used to to

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:59,520
faster recovering and some error

00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:03,030
conditions uses toppika we were we will

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,240
talk about some hardware features which

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:10,080
he used the to improve the performance

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:16,140
of a real time also the hardware

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:19,049
features to speed up the migration last

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,409
we were introduced to software

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,799
development we we recently did in the

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:33,329
community to improve real time and the

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:37,350
lambo Gration inter innovates some

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:41,509
features to make the visualization be

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:45,060
free the need to curate and use is a

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:48,540
presentation we will introduce catch us

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,570
a peek visualization and the posting

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,899
interrupt and we are mixed preemption

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,899
hammer

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:04,789
one for the future of a catch us is a

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:07,700
support to money to catch usage for the

00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:09,670
share the cage share the kata means the

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,650
catch is a shared between you all

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:15,640
between or cpos

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:20,420
also in a can spot that you won it so

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:24,140
the total and the local pennyways for

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:27,739
the photo share the cage

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:33,200
generally speaking local pennyways means

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:36,319
the communication between between CPU

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:41,140
socket you journey is Numa is an uma

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:49,540
system and total pennyways means all the

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:49,540
all the memory for the memory pennyways

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:56,450
nearest pub who has a sports it features

00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:58,910
so we can direct directly get it support

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:04,190
or forensics was fir'aun's source code

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:08,600
of nice kernel and you say it to you see

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:12,079
that you monitor the usage and the

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:17,810
pennyways over the cage for this best

00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:23,750
for the application another feature of

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:27,410
HQs is you either support catch

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:31,010
allocation as we know search share the

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:34,690
cage can be used to pair all the other

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:40,430
CPUs so all the cpu state accompanied

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:43,760
felony so we can we can we can check

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,730
this we can check this this case that

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,530
the low priority application can use

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:53,829
lots of cages that makes the catch is

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,120
ignored it is not enough for the high

00:03:53,829 --> 00:04:02,000
priority application so so this is not

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,729
good for the real time because the

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,780
real-time workload has high latency of

00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:14,830
the memory access

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:19,120
with with allocation technology we can

00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:24,670
limit the cage is used to pet low

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,130
priority applications that make sure the

00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:35,350
memory the memory recess is fastly

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:38,740
enough for the real-time workload so so

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:45,820
catch allocation can specify the amount

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:51,070
of cache space that application can fear

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:54,940
into each application can can associate

00:04:51,070 --> 00:05:00,610
it with cos cos is the value can be see

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:05,080
the cute MSR of the CPU this picture is

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:09,520
from Utah so that we all develop a

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:13,390
manual so first the case is the porter

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:17,740
case that is also the case if for CIT is

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:22,090
not supported in this case this for

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:25,419
application can use over the cage the

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,690
second case the first of allocation cos

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:31,600
0 can use over the cage however the

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:36,220
second application see you SOR colony

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:40,690
can Karuna use some substrate cage of

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:45,360
the COS 0 similarly serious tomb you can

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:51,340
use some estate kt resource awful awful

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:58,570
serious one the the kt resource of the

00:05:51,340 --> 00:06:01,390
serious 3 is the subset of c rescue the

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:05,290
so the case is that each application has

00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:08,130
the portion of the cage so there is no

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:11,430
catch contention between this

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,430
application at all

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:23,080
kj/kg co-ed cash curious or the support

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:27,400
to others for the two separate code and

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:32,020
the data from speaking show we can see

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:36,570
we can we can specify the key resource

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,570
for the cold and for the data

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:49,030
separate any so to see is the

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:52,870
performance of delta you who fought for

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:58,500
the CIT so we can see from the picture

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,500
if we if we wait if we didn't a us CIT

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:06,550
the what's the case is so what's the

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:09,430
case is the between 12 and and 24 under

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:15,000
24 after we used to CIT so what's the

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,000
case is it is only between 6 & 9

00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:25,440
the second official our digital is a

00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:28,020
peak region ization

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,820
and the positive interrupt our Genesis

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,960
this feature has it been mentioned many

00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:39,180
times in CRM of forum this feature can

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,830
directly inject interrupt to VMO the

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,340
again rubbish me the in the rubbish

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,580
chain includes the local the local

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:49,889
interrupt

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:54,840
for example the the IP i between scipios

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:58,289
and also include the external interrupt

00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,630
for example the interrupt is generated

00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:04,229
by the PCI device and the PCI device is

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:09,620
pass through the to the VM so this which

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:12,389
can can can a world or where makes it

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,120
this picture shows the performance of

00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:19,699
oil positing interrupts you can see

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:23,220
after enable possibly interrupt the

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:25,880
interrupt latency can be which can be

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,880
reduced a lot

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,670
this creature is about to be annexed

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:40,490
preemption Tamara the traditional

00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:42,970
hemlock has a status at the 1kg example

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:46,280
if it's a way I wanted to

00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,410
UWM wanted to set up a demo in the first

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,850
thing either to configure the which

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:56,780
hotel device in the VM so that we all

00:08:51,850 --> 00:09:00,410
course women x8 Zhen Zhen Shan KVM and

00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,960
jungkook and the key mechanic on show so

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:06,770
I'm whether needed to emulate these

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,260
virtual terminal device then it co h

00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:11,000
artemis to set up the demo for the which

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,640
would for the will show

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,370
tamo device and there's a chat time only

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,450
the to configure the physical thermal

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,090
device so so physical health so that the

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:29,450
physical thermo device can generate

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:33,140
tammy RQ the the Tama Tomoko pack can

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,530
signal the whiskers right after the

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,720
wispy oh sorry little Ronnie the

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:43,970
intensity Merrick you can inject to the

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,980
VM SIA has a well known pass we am a

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,520
preemption Tama is much different with

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:54,050
the net with the traditional Tamara yeah

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:57,080
there has a Carter in the in the BMX cm

00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:00,260
we MCS

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:04,490
certain mode is done it with the CPU

00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:07,640
running in the we mo x no road mode when

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:10,400
the counter reached sterile so CB o we

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,720
are spread well we're a piece which the

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,820
package we Amex

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,990
Ruta mode then then then the CPU as

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:23,710
right can inject SATA mode to the VM

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:27,860
cr-z is no threat she also knows right

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:30,020
context switch and it can be it and it

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,980
can reduce we may say it because a new

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:38,000
one we mercy it is is needed when

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:42,490
important we can keep the HRM or some

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,490
system we can speak or we has keep

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:57,640
the netherworld chemically whites

00:10:46,650 --> 00:11:01,240
interact now let's look at the Sofitel

00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:05,160
well the enhancement we really needed to

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:08,770
improve the real-time performance

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:14,290
recently we are working on no not ready

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:16,920
though we have our a mask MSI either in

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:22,420
the real-time kernel secona will use

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:25,870
shredded handala on default however this

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:29,560
is not beautiful kvn for example if the

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:34,720
recipients red is learning the the

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:38,470
actual generate it interrupts inter in

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,870
the air context we we needed to schedule

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:45,910
to the cannot write to handle to say our

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:51,160
cue then so cannot write signal to whisk

00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:53,440
use right then we need the to wait there

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,770
that we need the tooth schedule so we

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,620
cpus read back then whisk use right is

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:05,410
able to you check the RQ to the to the

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:08,500
guest so so so we see us rather is a

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,890
scheduler art and the colossal read is

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,080
scheduling then we secure schedule which

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:17,400
was reading is scheduled a yin so in

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:22,390
generate eric you see are their march

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:25,840
shredder context switch so if we use

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:28,440
non-serrated RQ since can be changed the

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,840
latest days we scipios read the running

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:39,390
our queue generator Eric how do we are

00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:43,900
generated interrupt the handle in the in

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:47,080
the in the interrupt context can signal

00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:51,220
so we CPU say after finish our kill

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:53,770
hondana the the whiskers read can switch

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,310
back there they can easily easily never

00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:04,950
to reject the are q2

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:07,950
guest this is the performs of data after

00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:12,420
use nonce already that we are Q we have

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:24,930
our MSI we can see the interrupt latency

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:28,350
also also can be hugely reduced now

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:32,270
let's look at the software ie

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,270
enhancement for the inauguration

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:40,080
recently wait we did this walk and an

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,480
appreciator in the community this this

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,440
walk is that we can skip such as mission

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:50,070
of guest a three-page genetic generic

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:53,070
speaking we can get free page if you're

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:56,330
measuring from the guest Colonel and and

00:13:53,070 --> 00:14:00,500
there's skip then during a migration

00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:04,950
this picture shows how does it work

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:08,010
before before before our our solution we

00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:12,410
need to transfer order or off with the

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:17,190
data memory to the destination after

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:20,430
using our solution which we have seen we

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,470
can see it's a separate page in the

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:27,500
guest can be skipped we only need the

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,500
tube for for new page to the destination

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:37,050
in order to implement this feature first

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:39,839
we should start the hello 30 page

00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:43,800
logging then we send the request that

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:47,360
user to the guest Colonel by using by

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,760
using with with with our panel device

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,450
once the guest colonel received this

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,459
request

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:58,860
it can either will walk the three page

00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:02,279
Lister and the country and they

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,880
construct a free page with a man the

00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:08,320
enter guest says I guess the column can

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,980
can pass this bitmap

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:16,480
back to high weather also by using with

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:20,079
our open own device after QE Miri you

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:25,240
say with this it map it can it can scape

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:28,630
it's a parade page in the guest it works

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:32,980
but we should pay pay attetion on the

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:36,220
horse because the because the bitmap

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:43,630
caught from the kernel content the horse

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:50,800
for example she has a gr gr has a memo

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:53,920
region on the top of 32 PS so so QE mio

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,360
before transforms a memory to the to

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,709
their destination

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:07,720
it should keep this kind of a memo

00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:17,290
reaching this is our tested tested

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:21,220
result so let us say first the case so

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:25,930
first the case is that so BM which has 8

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:31,120
GB RAM and just really just booted it

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:38,949
didn't it didn't do nothing it didn't

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:45,250
lead to anything so so most of most of

00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:48,579
our memory in this cast on not 13 and

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:53,320
also great the second case is that

00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:56,440
Tequesta also has the 80 GB memory but

00:16:53,320 --> 00:17:00,339
we first around application which rot

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,870
most of us the RAM and then terminate

00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:09,160
this application and under this case

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:14,069
laws of as a memory 30 but for the most

00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:19,329
part most of the memory are free because

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:21,640
we can see the see the result that the

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:28,900
time of lamb duration

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:30,040
we reduced a lot this is the normal case

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:35,590
that we used

00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:37,600
DBT kr2 forwarding to to to the

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,380
performance test during lemma creation

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:46,870
and we use and we used the 64 pets

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:51,280
packet to to the pitch bank we can say

00:17:46,870 --> 00:18:00,520
it's a the total time of remuneration is

00:17:51,280 --> 00:18:02,860
reduced cured heap is the hardware

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:06,460
feature to speed up level operation

00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:10,420
Hirata me is interest quick assistant

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:15,010
technology acuity has been integrated to

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:19,570
the chip site that can prove cooperation

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:24,280
and the D cooperation encryption and the

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:30,760
D and the D incorporation service acuity

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:33,280
as high as high as report either can

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,930
handle multiple pages you know single

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,570
request

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:41,980
it also can perform multiple requests

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:45,010
that means we can we we can send many

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:51,210
requests to the acuity device without

00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:55,210
needn't without with for within for

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:59,290
completion which the presentations that

00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:01,300
cutie is using a physical address so so

00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:09,280
the memory cannot be changed during

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:12,370
coitus work in order to integrate acuity

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:17,350
into cue email all the jobs can be done

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:21,070
in McCrory she's right and the cream you

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:24,310
can can creamer can send multiple

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:27,400
requests the truth acuity device and

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,710
also a um you didn't needn't pay

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,170
attention on the zero device because

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:35,500
security you had a well can handle

00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:37,880
zero page vodka tonic

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,799
because acuity is a walking on the

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,710
physical device so the user space isn't

00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:45,309
needed need just later

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:48,799
he's a reach address to research to

00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:51,799
physical to the physical address we can

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:57,260
use this profile to get the information

00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:59,720
to do the address just elation also on

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:04,480
the memory cannot cannot be changed that

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,480
during coitus walk so Emma log is needed

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:14,809
this is the test result for if we use

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:19,030
the if we use qit so what Claudia is

00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:22,789
that suggests the continuously generate

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:24,860
caliper a corpse data this kind of data

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:27,740
is used to pinch America to performance

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:31,340
of our compression we can see from the

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:34,880
results that the total evacuation time

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:37,340
can be reduced 40% so time time can be

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,270
reduced but you can be reduced 70

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:43,190
percent also the networking traffic can

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:46,669
be reduced that you can be reduced the

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:54,530
forty five percent also we can release

00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:58,870
time ascent of a CPU resource this case

00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:02,289
is what's the case for QT because the

00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:05,419
ester generate company attorney are

00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:10,820
rather than data to the you need the

00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:14,900
memory so so this the this kind of a

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:19,850
memory is not very friendly to Qt even

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:21,799
under this case acuity can your acuity

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,010
also can works either can get a better

00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,010
performance

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:38,370
so I have finished that the presentation

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:41,870
will have any question so you mentioned

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,429
you get the duty the freed guest pages

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:47,460
from the guest OS using a portable

00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:50,250
device which device a using well yours

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,070
what are open own device are you up

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:56,929
streaming those changes yeah we need to

00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,929
change the code of our stream

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,330
you mentioned that the pages can't be

00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,200
changed whilst the qat devices

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,670
compressing them does that mean the

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,820
guests the guests can't be writing to

00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:22,260
those pages I've had it you said when

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,860
when the pages are being transmitted

00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:27,570
with the qat acceleration you have to em

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,570
lock them and you said they can't be

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,940
changed what happens if the guest is

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:37,230
writing to those pages whilst they're

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:40,250
being processed by qat so those are

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,250
these question

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:56,390
I think I I think the the memory is not

00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,169
a direct and used aback UNT either

00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,169
should a copy

00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:16,100
so you form the question I have finished

00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,100
