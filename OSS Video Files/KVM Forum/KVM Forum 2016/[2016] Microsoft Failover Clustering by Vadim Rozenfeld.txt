Description: 
	Thinking about failover clustering as one of the features which helps to make high availability more achievable for KVM based Windows VM setups, Vadim is going to talk about adding Microsoft Failover Clustering compatibility to the existing Windows virtio-scsi miniport device drive, as well as about the relevant changes that need to be done at QEMU level in order to support Microsoft Failofer Clustering.

I'm a software engineer, working at Red Hat for almost nine years, and mostly specializing on developing para-virtualized device drivers for Windows platforms. I'm currently working on making Windows virtio-scsi miniport driver compatible with Microsoft Failover Clustering requirements. Last time I participated as a speaker at KVM Forum was in 2012 when I was speaking about Hyper-V enlightenment features, recently added to KVM http://www.linux-kvm.org/images/0/0a/2012-forum-kvm_hyperv.pdf
