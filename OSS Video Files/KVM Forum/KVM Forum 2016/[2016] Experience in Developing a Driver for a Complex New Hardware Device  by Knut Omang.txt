Title: [2016] Experience in Developing a Driver for a Complex New Hardware Device  by Knut Omang

Description: 
	In this presentation Knut Omang will talk about how he has been deploying a patched version of QEMU/KVM as part of a framework to enable writing an almost functionally complete device driver for a complex new network device before any hardware was available. Different levels of simulation/emulation has different benefits and challenges. Detailed low level simulation of hardware is accurate but painfully slow. High level simulation/emulation is fast enough to run real workloads, but with somewhat lower precision. QEMU/KVM with device hot plugging allows recompiling/relinking/restarting different device models while keeping the guest(s) running. Even after availablity of hardware, the QEMU anchored models are valuable tools, as some testing can be run on the models, saving expensive server hardware, and also simplifying monitoring of traffic between device and driver.

Knut Omang has been using and championing the use of virtualization for testing for many years. He is currently working for Oracle as the lead developer of a Linux driver and user space library for Oracle's new Infiniband HCA. He has been an early user/adopter of the Q35/PCIe based Qemu machine type, where he also has contributed a few patches such as the initial work on a virtual Intel IOMMU and SR/IOV support. He holds a Ph.D in computer networks from the University of Oslo, 1998. He also holds a part time position as associate professor at the University of Oslo, where he is lecturing and supervising students.
