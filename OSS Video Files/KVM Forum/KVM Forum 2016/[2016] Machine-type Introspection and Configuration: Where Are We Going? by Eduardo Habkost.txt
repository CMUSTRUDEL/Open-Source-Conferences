Title: [2016] Machine-type Introspection and Configuration: Where Are We Going? by Eduardo Habkost
Publication date: 2016-09-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	In the past years we have developed multiple solutions to try to make QEMU configuration more introspectable and machine-friendly (e.g.: -readconfig/-writeconfig, qdev, QOM, QMP, and others). Those solutions have addressed many problems, but don't cover all aspects of QEMU configuration and introspection. Some areas, such as machine-types and other command-line options lack machine-friendly configuration/introspection interfaces that effectively help management software.
In this talk, we will discuss existing deficiencies and possible approaches to cover them using our existing configuration and introspection mechanisms. The talk will touch some topics discussed at previous KVM Forum 2015 talks: "Rethinking machine types" by David Gibson, and "QEMU interface introspection: from hacks to solutions" by Markus Armbruster.
