Description: 
	Comparing to traditional full-blown VM based virtualization,light weight virtualization like Linux container boots much faster and runs more efficiently.But it also has drawback:the software-level isolation makes it not as secure as traditional hardware-enforced hypervisor.In this talk Anthony/Chao will share their work on tailoring and improving the traditional hypervisor to run a light weight VM, to gain both performance and scalability, while at the same time maintaining hardware-based isolation. Specifically, you will see how the open-source and industry-proven QEMU/KVM can be optimized to achieve near native container performance/scalability (e.g. fast boot and small memory footprint). Firstly,you will see how QEMU boot time can be shortened from ~300ms to ~50ms. Secondly, you will also see how these improvements be used in the related projects like Intel Clear Container and Docker.
