Title: [2016] Status Update on KVM-COLO FT by Hailang Zhang
Publication date: 2016-09-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	COLO is an ideal Application-agnostic Solution for Non-stop service in the cloud. Under COLO mode, both primary VM (PVM) and secondary VM (SVM) are run in parallel. They receive the same request from client, and generate response in parallel too. If the response packets from PVM and SVM are identical, they are released immediately. Otherwise, a VM checkpoint (on demand) is conducted. COLO prototype has been realized, and most of the patches has been reviewed in QEMU community. Same as last year, in this talk, we will talk about COLO implementation in QEMU, and report the latest progress from Huawei, Fujitsu, Intel, Since COLO is still in the early stage, some future works need to be done to make it commercial use, we will talk about that too.
