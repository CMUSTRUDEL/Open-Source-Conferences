Title: [2016] VMBus (Hyper-V) devices in QEMU KVM by Roman Kagan
Publication date: 2016-09-05
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	Paravirtualized devices are a well-established way to achieve better performance of virtual machines. However, for Windows guests using VirtIO-based paravirtualized devices isn't easy, because the corresponding drivers aren't bundled with the OS.

Roman Kagan will present the ongoing work on the implementation of VMBus devices in QEMU/KVM. This is the paravirtualization provided by Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization platform, and is natively supported by Windows guests.

The presentation will cover the design of VMBus support in QEMU/KVM, the state of the implementation, the challenges, and the outlook.
