Title: [2016] VMBus (Hyper-V) devices in QEMU KVM by Roman Kagan
Publication date: 2016-09-05
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	Paravirtualized devices are a well-established way to achieve better performance of virtual machines. However, for Windows guests using VirtIO-based paravirtualized devices isn't easy, because the corresponding drivers aren't bundled with the OS.

Roman Kagan will present the ongoing work on the implementation of VMBus devices in QEMU/KVM. This is the paravirtualization provided by Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization platform, and is natively supported by Windows guests.

The presentation will cover the design of VMBus support in QEMU/KVM, the state of the implementation, the challenges, and the outlook.

my name is Roman Karen I reckon virtuosa

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:23,820
and yesterday we had number of thoughts

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,730
on procurement the security team here

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,640
and clay layer in particular an

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:35,790
interesting dr. Steve her up for not

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:39,510
threatening me kam na reducing the tax

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,850
office today I'll be an important

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,780
different subject which is basically

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:50,280
gone in the opposite direction and in

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:56,000
feature is in one unit broaden the back

00:00:50,280 --> 00:01:00,090
surface actually we already have one see

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,070
discovered by Google team so we have

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:08,400
already won bad point on our track

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:17,310
record that's why okay i'll be talking

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:22,680
about implementing vm pass over which is

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:28,650
more correct and complete hyper-v

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:35,520
emulation going to be devices part into

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:39,740
you until you let me let me start by

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,740
introducing yourself

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:56,020
I work for the company which is which is

00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:58,990
not confer jobs or change the theme

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:04,390
already two times during my walk there

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:09,429
since 2015 13 2005 and I the different

00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:14,530
things they're writing from automated

00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:17,769
testing through drunken the balance the

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:21,580
project hypervisor and now I'm working

00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:25,870
for the team drunkenly also from

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:33,180
uk-based your chosen hypervisor which is

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:33,180
now released in virtual server version 7

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:42,280
before I move on I'd like to make a

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:47,170
couple disclaimers i'll be using a lot

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:52,239
of trademarks I already started with

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:53,680
some of them on the cover page so i put

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,870
the usual disclaimer that only

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,810
trademarks are the property of their

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:04,239
respective owners and nothing is it

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,510
about this more or less usual thing with

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,840
the open source projects which is the

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:14,709
only authoritative and up-to-date the

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:20,220
communication is the code so take

00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:26,320
whatever say with a grain of salt ok

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:30,440
here is the outline how discussed first

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:37,580
why we start this activity

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:46,210
and what is the business case what why

00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:46,210
we needed to start a new development and

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:59,450
very very under specified area and then

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,940
I'll consider the choices you might have

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:06,340
when setting up a Windows virtual

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:11,030
machine on only KDM they now go through

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:13,040
a bit more details on the actual

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:19,489
vacation of the canopy and when mass

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:27,170
innovation or try to discuss few aspects

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:30,790
of its structure which is not to

00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:33,530
development has where's the bounce and

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:38,030
while doing that I'll also talk about

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:41,150
the internationals we have now and I'll

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:45,770
also mention what the invitations beta

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:49,490
phase so that you can get a feeling of

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:53,090
when it's useful now and then I'll

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:57,130
conclude and brief of them what can do

00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:02,510
with this it could if you go well so

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:06,740
let's consider a user or system straight

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:14,320
one who is tasked with setting up a

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:18,320
virtual machine from windows in his

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,529
fancy flea Snuffy is about me to do this

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,109
very City

00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:31,229
much ground her breakfast at the cut

00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:36,289
price is big and he has the installation

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:40,229
media between this license key and

00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:43,829
Alexis feeling he's doing an access to

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:46,979
the control panel of our virtual server

00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:49,799
it can be any anything and you based

00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:54,539
hardware so what what does the user

00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:56,909
wants what in no particular order

00:05:54,539 --> 00:06:00,689
because for different workloads people

00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:05,789
want different things but the three most

00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:12,139
of all ones are cold if one virtual

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:12,139
machines in labor reasonable performance

00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:22,009
comparison to bare metal they wanted to

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:28,429
be easy T to deploy making initial setup

00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:32,899
and the one the whole thing is important

00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:38,809
so let's see what the user can deal is

00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:42,629
how how what you strong and what

00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:44,969
promises are made from an array chose so

00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:49,799
now the first most of this thing is to

00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:53,029
the evaluation of the real fabric so set

00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:57,259
up a virtual machine with failure in

00:06:53,029 --> 00:07:02,219
1000 network interface and are the

00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:05,609
authorized and that's nice because you

00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:11,280
can do immediately with the installation

00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:14,790
you have you have supported royalty

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:20,460
hi seventeen its homework I will talk

00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:26,810
about it later lead but ye don't get

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:29,990
improve and people who downloaded the

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:36,960
virtual machines from Microsoft

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:40,260
surrounding the first of inertia force

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,800
whatever usually noticed it's that's all

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:47,160
because it's configured with it ide hard

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,410
drive and some sort of supported network

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:54,330
interface and dense really stuff in

00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:56,690
why's that well the answer is not the

00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:00,440
most them at all but we'll go through

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:03,930
the rugged little difference between

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:07,229
running a presentation virtual machine

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,870
you can see physical machine in the

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:14,540
physical machine you have all the cities

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:18,030
and older are you control all of that

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:23,010
you can have more or less difficult time

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:28,560
in many operations so you know when like

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:31,350
a plate when he come out an inversion

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,280
machine things go absolutely different

00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:40,589
if your function can be created it can

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:43,409
be smoked out and most importantly what

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:47,120
many things become are able to

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:53,150
transition Finley expense very costly

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:55,000
any taxes in terminal operations like

00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:59,290
Ponte yo

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:05,410
not a young access to Emma stars and so

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:10,030
on so the usual devices are implemented

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:12,570
just doesn't make it for efficient

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:16,720
efficient running in a virtual machine

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:23,140
so the usual answer to this is our

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:25,810
virtual invasion so then you wanted to

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,390
be able to do most of the operations

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:32,650
without switching the context from the

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,120
guest to be first or vice versa and only

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,460
are we do it when it's really necessary

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:41,640
when you need to notify the other side

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:45,640
then the kaczmarek work to do so the

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:52,830
accusers choice of virtualization is

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:56,680
proton in community avail and its really

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:59,320
performing and people keep working on

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,830
them and improve on further the progeny

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:07,330
it's really nice and you can set up a

00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:11,020
virtual machine with dirt I know yet

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:16,260
devised for their scouting storage 00

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:19,200
and Lynn other devices which are

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,150
basically just questions till then and

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:30,310
you can tell this and you get the

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:32,100
performance with a big nose virtual

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,890
trackers which are found on this

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:40,330
language second actually people are made

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:42,160
presentations part so that's good good

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,400
good good one day you'll get one point

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,950
but things are getting very whether you

00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,880
want to

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:54,620
because you need to provide some carbon

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:58,700
drivers for the guests usually well so

00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:02,210
far virtanen drivers are not cheap for

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:05,840
the windows installation media probably

00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:09,260
remember being in shape because of

00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,990
license in increments builders sell you

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:15,610
capture some cow provided drivers to the

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:20,180
guest this is mitigated some cow when

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:22,670
people run virtual machines in cost

00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,200
environments because nobody actually

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:31,430
sets up a virtual machine from strange

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:33,530
typically around especially educated

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,020
system administrators who know how to

00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:40,000
set things up and which one she is a

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:44,330
chrome from what I one must range but

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,710
still it's extra work to do from

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:50,840
following the poem park there also how

00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,050
these cases for example when it

00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:57,320
downloaded a virtual image a virtual

00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:01,490
machine image from getting serviced that

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,590
you can control you wanted to have the

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,680
drivers for the virtual cargo on board

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:10,070
and you don't necessarily cabin from

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:13,040
need to play nasty tricks like doing me

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:16,690
to the conversion would make us the

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,180
first and so on which is usually very

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:26,510
separation and you can happen to the

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:29,090
other side so it's already Red Cross

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:34,760
here but the most important thing is

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:37,070
support as they a virtual drivers are

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,510
shipping out a supported by are

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:44,420
maintained by master ethical people who

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:47,360
are actually the welcome them accepting

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:52,440
patches and so on so things should be

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,980
good fortunately they are not

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:59,670
the problem is then so what's what's

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:02,640
wrong with this term problem is that

00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:05,520
when you run a virtual machine move

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,640
inland with Windows usually you want

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,350
support from microscope and to get

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,890
support for microsoft points and running

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,660
on the support and configuration to get

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,360
this opponent in it is not the pilot and

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,470
the simplification process involves

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:26,280
getting all the drivers is inside the

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:29,400
side windows to be all the foil for

00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:32,250
qualifying wittle fortified stone that

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,920
you can see us through the certification

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,520
process the tremors themselves clearly

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:42,140
you need to pass the whole thing the

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:46,020
hypervisor and the premises through

00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:50,430
through SVP certification and only then

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:56,910
you can get support but the problem is

00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:59,640
you really can you wiggle certification

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:03,230
if you if you take 2000 hours from

00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:06,630
somewhere else you only have to fall in

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:10,800
only then evenly you can do to license

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:14,880
and the decal for a licensed version

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:18,630
holy some life and your version which

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:22,590
you got wiggle away with some work so we

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:25,200
we had to just wrong with this we in now

00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:30,440
want to transfer to this until they

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:34,320
became to another leave we try and see

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:38,850
do a Malaysian of the microsoft phone

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:42,540
hydromatic which is faculty and if you

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:46,130
can't do this again performance because

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:51,800
it's more or less equivalent

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:54,980
and ideology to your channel so the firm

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,620
should be reasonable it becomes easy to

00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,370
deploy because you normally get it on

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:04,040
the installation media with windows and

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:06,020
not again support provided here to the

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,630
homework and pasta versatile piece of

00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:13,390
fish so that sounds like a plan and we

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:17,150
started supporting me so accountants

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:20,720
then the more or less explains why we

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:25,270
started from this so let's see how we

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:29,930
can do this if we have an opportunity to

00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:33,440
start infinitely actually we do we think

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:38,330
with it there are a number of sources of

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:41,420
this one is the documentation which is

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:44,390
always buy microsoft on github and this

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:47,780
link is clickable again another more

00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:51,470
more more than what they stood microsoft

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:57,400
thankies and it's microsoft was wasted

00:15:51,470 --> 00:16:00,070
strategy started to push gift drivers

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:04,010
and so they looks and now they are

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:06,350
settled there and we thought that we

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:10,940
could use the source code Z in the

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:15,590
metric host part and of course from

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:17,780
there has to be a boy here because the

00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:20,840
implementation published by Microsoft

00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:25,430
occasionally boring but the windows

00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:27,980
elimination lead because errors in

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:31,880
aspect which were implemented in the

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:37,330
lens driver but the actual windows

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,330
rather difficult like that okay

00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:52,930
7c ah what what components we had to to

00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:55,970
do to table hyper-v virtualization and

00:16:52,930 --> 00:17:03,410
cuddly revelation imitating air until

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:05,600
you in fact we had quite a few as they

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:10,670
call it immigrants already infinitely

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:13,490
our cars having some men besides created

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:16,579
a few more management and massage

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:26,900
synthetic and the cells which are used

00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:29,900
by various hyper-v dragus turned out to

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:36,080
be important in to implement a path give

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:38,870
us know our friends then in keystone of

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,660
this is pathetic synth anything tractor

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:48,480
problem which i will go through

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:50,980
typical on top of their parent Tyler's

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:56,020
which are also used by the various

00:17:50,980 --> 00:18:00,280
devices so weak attempt at them they are

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:06,220
there are few more hyper calls which I

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:12,370
used by my bus / verse two then the vm

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:14,980
does itself and finally the devices so

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,830
let's go through them one by one drink

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:21,940
system balance those weren't event by us

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:25,210
but they believe in male line table for

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:29,910
quite a bit of time in particular the

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:32,830
world view management MSRs quite

00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:37,240
pesticide the virtual process room

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:39,580
number and so on the fan will win

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:45,040
already implemented the Hydra count

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:47,850
infrastructure which used for a single

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,210
hyper count but quite useful

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:54,850
specifically the one in the next bullet

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:59,590
which is the scheduled halpern so that

00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:02,580
when I guess piece of you take a walk

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:07,090
and can make progress for Walton

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:14,680
releases the the control to the TV to

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:19,840
the calculator then if you one min see

00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:25,150
the lovely which were MSR accessissue

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:27,059
the most frequently used egg registers

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:30,559
that were

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:36,080
NFL Draft franklinville registrant EVR

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:40,740
asteroid register which are most

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:46,259
frequently asked one once and another

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:50,249
one is a exist page this is the same

00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:55,139
College as paradoxical Marshall para

00:19:50,249 --> 00:20:00,749
virtualized and Ventura which is

00:19:55,139 --> 00:20:05,610
implicated in giving four limbs get some

00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:08,549
college lazy yu e EU one eye and this

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:12,450
has already been done before meeting we

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:20,309
started to work again so we did a few

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:22,610
more first baby walking from was the

00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:26,519
management Emma stars which were

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:35,039
recently sir penny castles which allow

00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:38,700
the the guests t suppose it's blue

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:43,139
screen of death information for

00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:48,149
post-mortem analysis and report getting

00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:51,600
crashed and we here on time MSR which

00:20:48,149 --> 00:21:00,899
lost the guests you get better feeling

00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:09,840
of how it takes the host CPU then goes

00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:13,080
the one two three good point hyper-v

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,889
provides partition reference times we

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:20,669
just guessed which is basically month on

00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:25,710
the clock since both in hundred

00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:29,159
millisecond units and this reference

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,529
time is wearable to get into

00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:40,769
fourth one is the time reference count

00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:43,229
Rugen start the downside of it is it's

00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:47,759
an MS also to read you need to do if

00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:52,409
enacted which is expensive it's one

00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:55,139
limited portrait but still the outside

00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:58,669
is that you don't need any any severe

00:21:55,139 --> 00:22:03,960
requirements whether it's house of all

00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:08,519
hyper biggest then what Ricky part was

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:16,820
did CC reference page which is something

00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:20,549
controversial one Democratic this is a

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:25,950
partial shared memory clock signal to

00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:28,919
Kayla so the hypervisor puts she

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:33,090
parameters for the guests food to be

00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:38,359
able to interpolate the cork usually the

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:43,289
guest to see which on reasonably modern

00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:46,669
processors is running because of

00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:54,919
constant on a constant rain so you can

00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:59,190
reliably interplay the good news is that

00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:03,539
the access to this club incursion on

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:05,909
realizes the downside is that very

00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:09,330
existence is required with this is from

00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:14,729
the problem with with the symbolism a

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:17,039
few years of money another point here

00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:19,409
which is different from the kill game

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,139
clock is that there is only one per year

00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:24,629
so you don't need to go through the

00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:27,260
castle synchronizing all the Clarion

00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:34,190
folks across the virtual CPUs

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:39,020
we have to claim the ring consistency is

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:44,750
down a 16 sequence counter which you

00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:47,330
accessed on Kelly then you can indicate

00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,850
for this sequence counter that something

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:53,360
get what's wrong with the with the tasty

00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:56,270
page teesta graphics page report so that

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,620
against switches dynamically to

00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,380
something different false

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,230
bacteria-ridden the answer so if you

00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:05,870
regret from the first we're in there in

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,150
TC is available to another one where

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:12,940
these very few see is not available you

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:16,180
can just put su-kam equal zero to this

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:21,830
clock and the guest book Oh Calvin

00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:24,830
Ridley on the side one important

00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:31,120
difference is that Microsoft implemented

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:36,520
no sequel semantics on this list form so

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:40,550
all's just is it all we're recognizing

00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,800
to protect the baby box regular to

00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:46,580
protect the data on a base from the

00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:53,030
hypervisor the problem with a say in it

00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:55,310
see do in a way that it not only can see

00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:58,400
the authenticity of this one but you

00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:01,760
need to be long vary with respect to the

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,150
reference count o'clock and that's

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:09,560
something which we can achieve right now

00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:12,230
we are we are discussed approaches often

00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:21,260
this will be for the dancing but itself

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:25,340
has been ok then goes the equilibar the

00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:29,240
synthetic interrupt controller which is

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:33,170
like a consistent extension it strange

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,710
delete Lee Weyer a massage every listen

00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:41,510
to you

00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:44,000
is 16 synthetic inference the feature of

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:47,659
this other one of the important features

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:54,860
of this product is that it allows out of

00:25:47,659 --> 00:26:00,669
GOI semantics that is tracker kind set

00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:04,570
up the interim to not require adding any

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:09,620
acknowledgement so once it is delivered

00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:14,230
it is good to be acknowledged and this

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:18,380
next phase incompatible with the cover

00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:21,260
virtualization of heading this is

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:26,029
exactly where the problem lies there

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:33,190
what I was talking about the city and

00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:38,659
this this feature is finding the

00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:41,899
skillful it could be a couple people who

00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:45,110
were Bertram so we needed to sort this

00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:48,140
out somehow I hope the future versions

00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:53,870
of had the we may be able to work

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:58,340
without my speech self-incrimination was

00:26:53,870 --> 00:27:03,970
done by any new title for our cue

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:07,190
routing table entry which mess they

00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:12,049
decide to visit new number and synthetic

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:16,700
and remember this thing got arguably

00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:18,649
support so you can give you can signal

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,030
interrupts and get interpretation of the

00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:30,690
announcement through

00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:35,750
the mechanism and a special new user

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:39,480
space X tribe was added to be able to

00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:44,910
extract the MSM understand what values

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:48,630
for migration so that every time an MSR

00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:56,750
is updated you get anorexic you and it

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:59,540
can record it from for migration to

00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:02,310
other features of the pack of a

00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:06,150
synthetic interrupt controller are the

00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:09,720
message page which is an extra mechanism

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:13,680
for from interaction between the cost of

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,360
the guests so every synthetic

00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,440
interrupted from synthetic interrupt

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:26,390
gets its own slot in this page which

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:30,900
contains paintball indicator and one

00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:34,790
filled in this camp is the tag which is

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:37,650
exit atomically indicates the

00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:40,710
availability of this long so when the

00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:45,030
country was a first message it updates

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:50,130
this message tab in the third equation

00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:54,030
so we compare respond to some turn other

00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:56,790
than none with fellow and delivers

00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:01,730
interrupt and the guests the guests

00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:05,330
receive a large atomically clears the

00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:07,920
message tag and leave is the

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:13,110
acknowledgement interrupt constantly on

00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,000
a special end of message MSR which is

00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,940
other

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:23,420
sounds good which is also delivered to

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:26,330
users face through the undp another part

00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:30,340
of it on the singing is inventive lacks

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:32,330
page this is a one-way mechanism for

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,850
interactions between the guests the cost

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:42,800
its use the first they possibly it

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:47,150
doesn't hear any bailout and well the

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:49,550
word form is my place you update the the

00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:53,090
flag that are in front on the continent

00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:59,140
by the side and on the gas side we just

00:29:53,090 --> 00:30:04,450
cleared and the little pig farms with so

00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:08,150
the coast user of this machinery is

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:12,350
silent how can we provides for tyler's

00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:16,450
per CPU each time is configured by 28

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:21,070
massage and the Tigers were also in this

00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:25,490
partition reference time so they deliver

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:28,700
special form of messages which are they

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:34,190
detect red cape and mendelssohn barbers

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:38,480
hit every sunrise creation the liberals

00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:43,250
in its message not only the fact that it

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:46,460
has expired but also be the scallop

00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:50,090
expressions and handle the exam so i

00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:54,620
guess to do smart things with this

00:30:50,090 --> 00:31:01,670
information this is meditation was my

00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:03,470
main in helium so the Tigers are the

00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:07,400
first to take the the message slot if

00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,250
they are expired so the use of space

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:14,190
organ

00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:16,710
this is the SWAT later as usual the

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:21,270
Tigers can be there one shot and for the

00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:25,340
periodic a Tigers can be chillin so lazy

00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:28,100
in pyramid modulation which begin you

00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:33,210
usually translated see this current

00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:36,290
policy or salute policy policy and we at

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:40,080
the moment with in London teams amenity

00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:45,890
later serve only the basic mortgage is

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:49,440
available it's fine slimmer l'esprit de

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:54,180
only another part of this picture is

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,760
high two balls as i said i am already

00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:04,940
hate the implementation of finally hyper

00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:09,410
cause and being bus needed two more

00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:14,070
actually these two hypercars now make it

00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:17,970
some sort of symmetry between the guest

00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:20,610
costs and costs against interactions so

00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:25,890
the two technicals are both message and

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:29,700
civil men and we actually don't plan to

00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:31,770
process anything of them in okay so they

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:37,230
are just passed through to the user

00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:41,180
space with a special subtitling hyper-v

00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:44,490
exit we're in the information on the

00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:47,580
type of game and the gym you

00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:51,030
fermentation is at the moment step 1 so

00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:55,950
receives the exit but doesn't learn

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:56,909
anything smart with it the work is going

00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,489
on

00:32:56,909 --> 00:33:03,029
the Maine State this is mr. from being

00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:08,509
done sequester eyes now the damn matter

00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:11,789
itself so we privately at the core part

00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:18,299
what is reverse it's a special kind of

00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:21,419
device announced by a CPI and in England

00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:24,509
shell it said message in connection

00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:29,840
between customer guests so we're in the

00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:32,879
cost was delivered TG chemically guest a

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,349
pots message and produces a testing

00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:39,690
ground and I think the guests want C to

00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:46,649
communicate to the cast it issues a

00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:50,789
postmessage at home so this connection

00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:54,599
is used to do various management things

00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:58,950
like negotiating versions parameters and

00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:01,349
so on capabilities discover the device

00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,389
is available on the way glass by the

00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:09,450
hypervisor prevent any money back or

00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:15,270
item set them up and most importantly

00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:18,119
set up the daily challenge so what are

00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:23,879
the patient's the NHL's are very singh

00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:28,909
with the retiree not Keith so basically

00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:32,869
this is a discovery which is similar

00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:37,619
setups difference signal to birthday own

00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:40,030
hearings they should at least one per

00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:46,510
device usually make

00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:55,230
one than one and the signal is used his

00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:55,230
gun violence park so cost per guest is

00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:01,300
revenge back by change to take interim

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:07,300
and guess the cost through this economy

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:11,380
I become the main uses of this is ems is

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:16,540
the bitterness for 14 mesmerizing like

00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:21,250
what you see in profile so what what are

00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:24,790
we doing with all this we are planning

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:29,620
to have at least four basic types of

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:34,510
devices implementing this are you till

00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:39,730
in terms of devices which are hardly

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:45,210
like watchdog time synchronization in

00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:48,400
certifications shut down multiplication

00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:53,380
storage device then get organized and

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,240
one device we both up with detail

00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:59,340
devices because they are the simplest

00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:04,570
change event and with moncat very

00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:09,370
working on top of that what it is in a

00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:11,320
very ad hoc very so it is to be ported

00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:13,860
over to the infrastructure that has

00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,860
landed them

00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:24,069
the work on storage network is in the

00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:26,829
grand stage so I wanted to say none at

00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:33,160
the moment and it's always the balloon

00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:37,390
device so one point here also they in

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:41,349
order to be able to boot from vertical

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:43,210
storage on plastics implement guest

00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:47,700
driver but not for the guests

00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:54,040
pregnancies to bed for the program and

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:57,040
we achieve from where parents are see

00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,900
bias and on Vienna and without city

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:06,069
built in support must them from the

00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:09,609
chemical once the storage devices are a

00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:16,329
bikini one bought this and order if

00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:19,770
Lynette so with the wrap up we shall

00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:25,030
within a week and how the junk work done

00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:32,250
in jail he can even kill you today with

00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:35,890
intimately p.m. mass devices the

00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:38,650
limitations being worked on and we think

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:43,829
that it's gonna be viable solutions in

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:52,780
May windows gifts life easier on in you

00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:56,859
live and what we can do father is from

00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:59,400
smelkinson chillin perhaps a constant

00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:59,400
pressure cuz

00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:10,910
because IAM bus devices are very similar

00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:10,910
to vertigo and we may be able to do this

00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:20,579
hopefully we'll be able to also prevent

00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:24,150
the transfer for for the lease of the

00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:26,940
rest handling also some more features

00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:30,599
available in catalina like to airport in

00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:39,440
debugging and other devices should be

00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:39,440
possible tree so gallatin virtual

00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:48,200
a quick question city said if you

00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,910
implement this being blessed you no

00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,710
longer have to deal with local will

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:55,040
there be some form a certification that

00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:58,940
needs to be done to certify the mean of

00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:02,180
us implementation with Kenya yep we

00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:05,690
wouldn't need to do we go because the

00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:07,910
drivers only ride by myself so we'll

00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:11,930
have to do this to the friend a

00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:18,290
certification is Lester but this this is

00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:21,680
something that vendors can do they be a

00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:25,690
process for SDC application is more

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:29,510
under control vendors you can do Giglio

00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:33,500
implementation of the hypervisor you can

00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:35,870
do certification on your own you can

00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:40,850
share it before and this more power what

00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:44,360
we are going to do with you know me too

00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:49,810
well to a lot of someone's will

00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:52,850
distribute your Yoko other proprietary

00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:56,290
license or whatever which is what what

00:39:52,850 --> 00:40:01,750
we go grab section so this is a scowl

00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:01,750
they should simplify things it has it

00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,590
and sounds

00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:13,160
about the same reason that you mention

00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:16,460
it so Huckabee has different type of

00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,800
socket then do the using isn't well

00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,960
actually this is the upload car if you

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,240
root go really well I know if we have

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:29,390
enough resources to implement say to

00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:32,960
grab this but how do Regas describe some

00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:39,670
sort of socket in phase for management

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:42,970
they named it integration services

00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:47,660
transferred or something like that and

00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:51,260
it's tuk base so we hope it will be able

00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:54,740
to to do the hot side of this looking

00:40:51,260 --> 00:41:02,030
likely because this or transport I'd

00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:04,280
know works out I just have one

00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,500
suggestion you talk about the deal since

00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,540
integration it might be easier to

00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,340
Louisville's user integration first is

00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,530
the name from the back end on either

00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,990
score possible and I have the option to

00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:17,870
the current to get running absolutely

00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:22,040
quite possible with it sorry this is not

00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:24,020
on the top private released actually so

00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:29,570
we need to first to prevent the divisive

00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:34,430
cream felt okay so this will in turn 1

00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:37,340
p.m. right not the salad I mean not even

00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:41,180
to that it has not reached a sound which

00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:46,610
is secret to jam our promise this should

00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:50,060
be more wine jug one but I think it

00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:53,690
should be compatible with Jensen mostly

00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:55,250
I know but we didn't have features bike

00:41:53,690 --> 00:42:03,970
you should be personal for the two

00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:08,420
generations so I'm not sure we try to

00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:17,890
to see works with jen to be basically I

00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:17,890
to do work like a Harvard enjoys no see

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,839
also talking about yes we you mention it

00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:30,290
we may skip see bars integration I'm

00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:32,869
only provide Jen to you interface forces

00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:35,780
we can because our user base is

00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:42,710
interested in sport bumper is interested

00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:53,690
in front of 250 2008 windows machines

00:42:42,710 --> 00:43:00,430
and they do not work in Gentilly windows

00:42:53,690 --> 00:43:05,290
does support we both saw some update to

00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:10,609
the guest in less say the truth anyway

00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:13,550
just Jerry boot windows to fabricate

00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:18,349
machine in the judge william you know

00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:22,910
cover all you go original access pack

00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:29,140
which they have discussed this i do have

00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:29,140
to be some but for every 1 i've never

00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,620
no person

00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:39,609
