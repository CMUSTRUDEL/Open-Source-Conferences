Title: [2016] Jobs and Unemployment in the New QEMU Economy by John Snow
Publication date: 2016-09-08
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	QEMU has a legacy blockjobs system with a somewhat tenuous and poorly designed interface. The current state of Blockjobs is that you can only run one at a time, and the permissions system underpinning when you are allowed to run them is opaque to the user. This can make managing long-running background jobs somewhat difficult, and the lack of persistent handles to jobs that modify the storage tree can make it even more difficult. In this talk I will discuss the future of QEMU Block Jobs, including the abstraction of the "Job" concept to encompass all of QEMU to present a unified object representing long-running tasks to management APIs such as libvirt.
