Description: 
	Libvirt has been well known for providing a stable abstract middleware layer that hides hypervisor specifics from its users in order to provide a uniform way of management, while having most of its features available through libvirtd daemon. Although libvirtd can be configured through a configuration file, there has not been a way to change the configuration nor manage the daemon itself during runtime. And that is exactly where libvirt Admin API comes in.
This presentation will explore this new administration interface the goal of which is to support runtime daemon management. During the presentation, scenarios like tweaking the log settings to make the daemon more or less verbose and, thus tailoring it to one's linking, threadpool management, as well as looking at clients currently connected to the daemon will be addressed and demonstrated by using the virt-admin utility.
