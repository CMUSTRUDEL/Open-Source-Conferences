Publication date: 2016-09-02
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	GPU virtualization becomes more and more important these days since its first public debut in 2013. To bring vGPU solutions of different GPU vendors onto KVM/QEMU platform, while maintaining a highly unified kernel and user space interface, a VFIO based vGPU framework is introduced in this presentation. In this talk, we will review the GPU vendor driver registration interface, the vGPU bus, vGPU core driver, VGPU TYPE1 IOMMU internals, walk through vGPU enabled VM life cycle, introduce the kernel and user space sysfs and the framebuffer interface for QEMU console VNC, discuss roadmap for future vGPU VFIO framework performance/scalability optimization.
