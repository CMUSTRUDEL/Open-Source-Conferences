Description: 
	Prefetch (aka readahead) is a well-known technique to improve sequential data read performance. However, making it generally useful is challenging, because real-world workloads are typically dominated by random access patterns, which defeat the prefetch efficiency for sequential accesses, and vice versa, latency of random requests may degrade due to prefetch.
In this presentation, Pavel presents an implementation of the prefetch cache as a QEMU block filter driver which improves the I/O performance while maintaining the adverse effects under control. He demonstrates the results of the tests that measure QEMU I/O performance in different configurations of the QEMU block subsystem including the one using virtio-block data plane scheme.
