Title: [2016] Backups with QEMU by Max Reitz
Publication date: 2016-09-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	QEMU has various different ways of creating backups of disk images while the VM is running: External snapshots, internal snapshots, a “backup” block job, and a “mirror” block job. In turn, each of these may have sub-varieties. After explaining what these things are, this talk will give a high-level user-oriented overview of the characteristics and distinctive features of each approach to serve as a guideline on when and maybe even more importantly on how to use which.
