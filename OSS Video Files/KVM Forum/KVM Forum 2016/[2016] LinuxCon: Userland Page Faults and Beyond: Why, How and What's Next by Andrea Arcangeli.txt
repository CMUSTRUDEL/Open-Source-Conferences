Title: [2016] LinuxCon: Userland Page Faults and Beyond: Why, How and What's Next by Andrea Arcangeli
Publication date: 2016-09-08
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	The userfaultfd syscall has been merged in the upstream Kernel in v4.3 and QEMU depends on it to implement Postcopy Live Migration since v2.5.0. The first implementation only covers anonymous memory and it is only capable of trapping non present faults with a cooperative usage, but various new extensions to fully leverage this new method to manage the memory from userland are under development. This talk will cover the future extensions to userfaultfd and various potential new usages for the syscall.
