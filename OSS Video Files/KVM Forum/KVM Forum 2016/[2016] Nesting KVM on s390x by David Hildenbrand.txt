Description: 
	The way virtualization is built into IBM z Systems hardware allows for a quite neat and clean implementation of nested virtualization. This session gives an introduction to nested virtualization on IBM z Systems, explaining where we stand, how it works and what is missing. Also included is a short discussion of security aspects. Be prepared for some memory management, interrupt handling and virtualization insights.
