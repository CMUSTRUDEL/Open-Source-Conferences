Title: [2016] Qemu as a USB-MTP Responder by Bandan Das
Publication date: 2016-09-09

Description: 
	Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is an extension to Picture Transfer Protocol for handling transfer of media files. MTP exposes a file oriented protocol where the MTP responder is in control of the file operations and capabilities. Atomicity guarantees by the MTP server thereby help with eliminating data corruption which are seen with block based file sharing. This talk is an overview of the Media Protocol Server implementation in Qemu. By exposing itself as a MTP server, file sharing between hosts and guests is as simple as choosing a guest file browser with an integrated MTP client. We will delve into implementation details such as file operations and monitoring, usage scenarios, and unimplemented features such as write support. We will also discuss the pros and cons with respect to other host-guest sharing mechanisms available in Qemu.
