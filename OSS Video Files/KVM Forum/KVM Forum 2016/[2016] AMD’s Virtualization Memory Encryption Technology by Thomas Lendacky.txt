Description: 
	AMD recently disclosed the new Secure Memory Encryption (SME) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) x86 technologies which leverage hardware-based memory encryption to provide additional security protections. This talk will focus primarily on the SEV technology which supports encrypted virtual machines for extra isolation and protection from the hypervisor itself. The presentation will discuss the technical details of this technology with a focus on how it can be integrated within the KVM infrastructure.
