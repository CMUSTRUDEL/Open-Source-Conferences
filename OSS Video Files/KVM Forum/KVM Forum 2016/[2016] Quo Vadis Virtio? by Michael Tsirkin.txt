Title: [2016] Quo Vadis Virtio? by Michael Tsirkin
Publication date: 2016-09-05
Playlist: KVM Forum 2016
Description: 
	Last version of virtio was published about a year ago: in october 2016. The virtio community has been idle since: implementations are constantly being improved, new features are in the works, or are being discussed. This talk will present an update on current status of the implementations and the challengest they face, and look forward to how we may address these challenges. It will highlight some of the proposed new features and the benefits they might bring. It will also suggest untested ideas for new applications for virtio on which (to presenter's knowledge) no one is currently working - some of these might turn out to be impractical, but most should serve as useful starting points for a discussion.
