I am part of Red Hat Virtualization team for about 4 years. My main focus is on QEMU's infrastructure and PCI subsystem, co-maintaining the 'pci' and 'machine-core' sub-trees. Projects I worked on include QemuMachine conversion to QOM, PCI/PCI Express native hot-plug, Multiple PCI root bridges with NUMA support, Multiple Root complexes.
