Title: [2017] libtcg: Exposing QEMU's TCG Frontend to External Tools by Alessandro Di Federico
Publication date: 2017-11-28
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	The QEMU translation engine, the TCG, supports tens of architectures. Such a large support is possible thanks to the decoupling of the interpretation of input instructions and the generation of the translated code through the usage of an intermediate representation: the tiny code instructions.

Lifting instructions to an IR is of great interested in several fields outside emulation. Specifically, binary analysis tools (such as IDA Pro, BAP, angr and binary.ninja) often struggle to support many architectures due to the difficulty in interpreting the exact behavior of each instruction of an ISA.

This talk presents challenges and opportunities in the ongoing effort (bit.ly/2t9j8PV) to expose the TCG frontend to external applications. We'll discuss the build system, the design of the API, how to expose helper functions (e.g., FP and syscall implentations) and a real use case, rev.ng.
