Title: [2017] Testing Techniques Applied to Virt Development by Cleber Rosa
Publication date: 2017-11-22
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	Software Testing practitioners are aware of testing strategies that exceed the developer's usual approach to test. While it is understandable that the two roles are inherently different, there are some strategies (and tools) that can greatly benefit how code is tested during development.

This talk will present the theory behind techniques such as Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis and Combinatorial Testing backed by real world virtualization code and use cases.

Finally, to break out of the boring theoretical space, practical demonstrations of these techniques will be applied to QEMU subsystems. This will tie the concepts and examples into improved test cases and extended test coverage.
