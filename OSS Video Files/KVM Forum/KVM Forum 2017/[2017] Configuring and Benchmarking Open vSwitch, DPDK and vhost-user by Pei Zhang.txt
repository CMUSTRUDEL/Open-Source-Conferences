Title: [2017] Configuring and Benchmarking Open vSwitch, DPDK and vhost-user by Pei Zhang
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	Network Function Virtualization, a network architecture where virtual machines replace components such as firewalls or load balancers with virtual machines, can be very sensitive to network latency or throughput. A typical NFV architecture under KVM uses components such as Open vSwitch, DPDK and vhost-user; despite the pecularities (such as handling packets in user space during whole process, consuming multiple cores with 100% to polling the network ports), this can provide good network performance. However, configuration of the various components and of the virtual machine itself is very important to obtain the best possible network performance.

In this talk we will show how to configure Open vSwitch, DPDK and vhost-user, and present throughput and latency results that quantify the impact of hugepages and multiqueue and the importance of using the "PREEMPT_RT" realtime kernel.

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,330
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:16,199
welcome to at under this session my name

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,220
is Peyton I am a quality and linear form

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,810
Braille hat today I'm going to share

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,210
configuring and benchmarking upon vase

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,490
which typically and the way hosts a user

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:31,470
this is the typical elevate solution

00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:34,590
into this talk first I will give a

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,800
simple background introduction of the

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,469
have a of explain why the natural

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,140
performance is important in the

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,620
virtualization environment and then I

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,170
will share the configurations I will

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,610
explain each component how they improve

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,699
the performance next I will show how to

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,520
get better performance based on the

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,730
user's different performance

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,260
requirements last I will show our

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:09,810
testing results with this configuration

00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:15,720
and away the phone name is the network

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:21,210
function virtualization it's the average

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,939
of variety of the network appliance will

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,570
be replaced by the virtualization and

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,270
software which means the soft the func

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:34,110
the network a function they will be not

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,740
limited to the specific hardware it will

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:41,310
be implemented as the software in the

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,610
virtualization environment this is the

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,610
unhappy architecture proposed by the

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:51,720
European telecommunications standards

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:55,680
Institute it has mainly for Cal State

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,590
Hills the bottom the light bottom is and

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,399
have a infrastructure in this layer the

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,040
hardware resources are virtualized as

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:08,530
virtual resources including the virtual

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,310
computer Resource Network resource and

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,490
and the storage resource so it provides

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,910
the dis resources to the UH players a

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:21,040
virtual network a function there the

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,650
virtual network a function they are they

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,250
in play they developed their software's

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:30,130
in the virtual machines and the red part

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,880
is enough enough a manager and

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,420
Orchestrator

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,640
it covers the management and the

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,120
lifecycle management of the hardware

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,940
resources and virtual resources and it

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,630
also covers the lifecycle management and

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:50,440
Orchestrator of the knives the top layer

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:55,330
is users operating operating support

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:58,240
system so this architecture it's an

00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,550
ecosystem different vendors can only

00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,010
involve the unit also including the

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:08,320
network vendors network of function

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:12,010
vendors so when they developed the their

00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,750
software in the virtual machines as the

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,150
telecommunication they have straight

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,120
they have restricted requirements for

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,150
such as fault management and the

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,720
security management also the network

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,970
performance management Ingrid in the

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,970
landing science report the network

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,750
performance should be ensured at

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:37,140
acceptable level

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:41,160
so one replaced the software with which

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:44,560
when replaced the hardware with software

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,680
the network of the network should also

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,620
be ensured so as it develops the

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,380
software in the virtual machine so

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,110
that's why the voting machine should be

00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:00,220
able to provide good basic network

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:03,100
performance so so this is what we are

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,780
talking about provide good network

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:10,510
performance in the Navi infrastructure

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:15,370
this is a configuration open V switch

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:18,209
and the q vm running over the real seven

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:23,830
platform the open V switch is

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:26,229
accelerated by the TDK the vm and open V

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:32,940
switch communicates by the way host a

00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:36,400
user protocol also the in the host as a

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:41,289
Linux network driver is replaced by the

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:46,150
user space driver they FL so let's say

00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:49,560
how each component improve the network

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,810
performance let's say DB DK first

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,320
DB r EK is the theta plan development

00:04:52,810 --> 00:05:01,560
aid it's a set of libraries and drivers

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:05,919
for faster packet processing so it has

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:10,630
this and this and it's fit this and its

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:13,270
features the pulley motor pulley among

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:17,229
the drivers so pooling mode means the

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:20,530
CPU constantly check the status of the

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:25,630
network reports no matter it's busy or

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:29,140
adult so the poll of the jurors it is

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:34,419
will pulling the net pulling the network

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:37,750
ports constantly so each pomalyst regime

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:41,370
will cost the 100% of the CPU resource

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,320
and also the deepika support is a multi

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:48,640
PMDs ratings

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,380
another feature is it uses hood page the

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,870
default hood page size is the four

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:56,880
kilobytes and who pays good page size

00:05:52,870 --> 00:06:00,550
has to macbeth and the one gigabyte as

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,570
we'd paid never swept out of memory it

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:07,750
cost it has lower TLB miss that's why

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:11,860
the performance can be improved

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,919
another feature is debilitate handles

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,680
the packets in their user space it's not

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:20,770
providing the layer 3 network packets it

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,350
it's supports the layer 2 network

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:30,130
packets so let's compare the standard

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:33,820
Linux kernel driver and as a tip DK the

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:37,180
standard Linux with standard the Linux

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,720
kernel driver once the network our drugs

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:43,449
Edison Network heart it was through the

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,970
Linux Network a stack and the users

00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:49,120
application that is is packaged by a

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,660
system course and copies a memory from

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,060
the kernel space to the user space as

00:06:51,660 --> 00:07:01,900
the typically it uses the users base

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:05,710
driver so so the Linux network the Linux

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:08,650
Network stack is bypassed as the Linux

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:14,039
Network stack is designed for more

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:17,560
common Network locations it supports the

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:23,320
protocols from the different and network

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:27,729
layers so in diplucate it's this the

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:30,430
user space Trevor this this stack is

00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:33,570
bypassed and also the user space

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:38,530
application can directly visits as a

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:41,490
physical network so there are there's no

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:44,919
the the system course and no memory copy

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,870
so that's why the typically in the user

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:50,490
space it can improve the network

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:54,419
performance so the typically has

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:57,610
supported they host a user back handle

00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:01,060
they host the user is accumulator it

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:03,360
allows the VM to ship the via the

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,789
virtual machines to share its memory

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,760
with another users based applications on

00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:13,930
the same host it's an improvement from

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:16,960
the water own ETSU's of a host and to

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:20,380
the V host a user so the V host the user

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,470
it's a Civic loud motor it communicates

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:27,159
by the United domain socket and the

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,880
shared descriptor is in the in this

00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,660
socket

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,890
so once the

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:37,520
VM access server mode and typically can

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:42,410
act as the trend mode on vice-versa so

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:45,290
the open V switch has supported the DVD

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:48,080
key and they host the user I'm not

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,660
talking a lot about movies which is

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,660
complicated I only talk about the

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,110
performance related part as standard

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,770
obvious the did pass is in the kernel

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,080
space

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,850
now the Lea supports that if they click

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,040
and they host the user they have added

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,620
the use of Baystate passes another thing

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,120
away so it it means when the package

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,250
received that they will be handled in

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:16,880
the user space so let's keep them out

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:20,090
here for some waiting as they may be

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,220
Lente's insensitive so that's why the

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:29,020
caviar Monti may be required I will talk

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:31,550
the results later so let's do a summary

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,560
with this configuration the other

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:38,000
package they are handled in the user

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:42,020
space and the this configuration is

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,250
using the podium on the drivers and more

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:48,130
cars can be used and as one hundred cost

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,860
of one hundred percent of the resource

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:54,140
another is the field page is used in

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,370
this configuration also I'd like to

00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:04,040
highlight another to capo to point is

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:06,920
the sticky isolation and CPP so in this

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,380
configuration either the CPU is used by

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,250
the open V switch oh but I used to buy

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,040
the VM

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,230
these people should be isolated which

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,780
means they will be for the isolated

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:23,060
abuse they will not be used until they

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:28,340
are explicitly set so when we isolate a

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:31,040
group of course we pin this we pinda the

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,880
thread into the dedicated

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,670
CPS also there should be no overlap

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,010
so the CPU pinna to the open V switch

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,170
should not be overlapped with us if you

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,890
pin it with

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:52,690
another is none point is restriction

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:54,960
Ummah policy if the the Numa host at

00:10:52,690 --> 00:11:00,490
least has two new models

00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:03,480
well we won't so the open V switch and

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:06,520
VM should use the scipios and memories

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,720
in the same new map not with networked

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:13,930
device otherwise we the network

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,270
performance will be lower so how this is

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,710
some details of the config this is a

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:26,350
they host the user they host the user

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:29,560
the memory must be said shared and when

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:33,100
the VM acts as the V host a user server

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:36,520
it will create the they host a user

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,850
socket and the Buddhist which must a use

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:43,330
the same they host the user socket so

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:48,339
the obvious via CTL it's a user

00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:53,230
interface of the openness which it can

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:58,800
query and set up from some executions of

00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:02,500
the openness which create page quit page

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:07,029
needs the CPU support and the kernel

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:10,510
support so this is a flag for supporters

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:13,240
of wanky but which page also we need to

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:17,980
add the default code page status or

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:23,709
canola this is how the creat page it is

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:26,620
used to Enzo in the XFL of the virtual

00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:30,040
virtual machines this is as a later

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,830
course we isolate caused by I Dean's are

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,589
also to the crinoline and also actually

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:39,070
in our testing way as data caused by the

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:43,330
tuned in the not not in the non

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:46,720
real-time system way way athlete caused

00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,570
by using the CPU petition in the real

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,630
time we use the

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:54,420
in host we use the tune them and have a

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,710
host and in the guests will use attuned

00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:01,080
and have a guest also besides the

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:05,150
isolator cause they the two in the wheel

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:09,690
will add some options these options I

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:15,630
this option they are tam-tam sticks Tam

00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:20,040
camera or something like that I so in

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:23,220
order to improve the performance Numa

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:26,390
policy well first we need to check the

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,250
physical network where it's located

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:32,340
where you we check this by the hardware

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:38,790
lock and in this example it located in

00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:42,090
sir in 101 so then one we put the VM we

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:45,600
should use the CPU and the memory in

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:49,530
human of the one and we banned all the

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,260
PMDs of the open V switch in the Neumann

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:57,570
of the one also there is no overlap in

00:13:52,260 --> 00:14:01,770
this example I used I use the four cars

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:04,770
for the open V switch this is a key via

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,020
Marti actually with Coverity we didn't

00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:09,780
cost more resources just the

00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,120
configuration is different this is a VM

00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,420
we add the all this appeals to the

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,090
faithful one priority and we need to

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,960
install the kernel RT packages and the

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:25,620
karateka vm practice and also used the

00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:29,790
FIFA one priority to the other PMD our

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,850
threads this is our testing to party we

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,980
have two hosts connected back to back

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:37,560
the montains running on one host and the

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,230
open Ave and open V switch running on

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,370
another host the mountain is running

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,520
over the TDK

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:48,210
it generates packet from one port and

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,830
receives it back from another part so

00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:54,270
this is how we measure the throughput

00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:57,360
and the lanta see the open list which we

00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:00,149
weigh create either four parts

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,079
like a pot and to be host a user pot the

00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:07,529
to typically pot is a communicates

00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:10,110
between the external and the host and

00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:15,120
the way host the user communicates

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:18,089
between the VM and the holster so the

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,240
whole packet flow is it it received a

00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:23,730
package from ddk and in the DVD clip hot

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,950
and in the open V switch we had a flow

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,110
between the diptych a pod and a host the

00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,730
user pot and that in forwards the

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:35,010
packets to the very host a user thought

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:36,630
and then the guest can receive the

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:40,250
package from the way host the user pot

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:47,100
so this is out testing to party and also

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:49,800
in the with we totally have six pots the

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,470
open visit has four parts to DVD teapot

00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:57,450
and TV host the user pod so pro pot we

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:59,459
need to find dedicated a quorum it means

00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:03,510
the open base which will cost at least

00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:07,800
four cars and it costs all all of them

00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:11,550
cost 100% and the VM cost to cross at

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:16,529
100% so in this configuration we at

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:20,720
least need six six CP or a sip 6 DP

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:26,040
resources I will show the results later

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,769
so how to improve that's the that I

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,240
explained as the correct configuration

00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:33,269
so how to improve the network

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,120
performance and some may mean hires

00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:38,910
report from a needle lower than TC and

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:43,140
some mini de Hierro packet loss so for

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:46,589
her through for her support we support

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,100
the multi kill the open V switch and the

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,180
VM

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,760
also need to set multi kill use also the

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:59,699
Scipio partition with CPU partitioning

00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:04,319
we can reach zero package a lot and and

00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:09,200
the lower l2 Network Lente's it also we

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:13,890
I will show also with caviar Marty

00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:17,520
we can Cuba Marty can provide the lower

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,300
landings actually in order to makes a

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,270
difference

00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,100
I call this landing say to the cyclic

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:29,460
pestilent is it I will explain more

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:32,430
later this this this is the multi cue

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,040
our testing topology it's very similar

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:38,820
to the former one the different the

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:46,110
different is the lines at the border so

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:47,730
for as for the each part we eat pod

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,700
weapon the dead kitty the currents

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,680
through each part so for each kill we

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,640
also need to bundle the dead Kitty the

00:17:52,680 --> 00:18:01,440
cost to procure per pot so for the two

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,840
kills we need at least 12 cores and this

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,250
cost should be in the same Numa node

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:11,010
with the network devices this is a

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:17,970
configuration can configure it with the

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:21,570
open V switch set that the PM PMD that

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:25,740
KT the course and set the arc skills of

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:31,670
the diptych hip hot this below below is

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:37,020
the the VM they host the user two kills

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:39,480
so this is the testing results with two

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:44,640
kills the throughput value is much

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:48,750
higher than the single kill it's it can

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:54,120
reach we are testing with though 64 byte

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:56,220
packet size it can reach the 30% of the

00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,610
learn rate we are testing with the 20

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:04,140
bytes network hearts actually this

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:07,200
result can can reach when we testing

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:11,610
with the bear mental the throughput is

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,840
also this value so this is the maxi well

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,840
this report we can reach

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:22,860
with the CPU partitioning and with dog

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,980
CP partitioning um we CPU partitioning

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:29,720
we can reach the zero packet loss and

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:33,180
the network Valentine's Day is lower so

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:36,060
we tested out two Network redundancy by

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:44,040
the time spam in tune one between

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:48,090
received time and the center time this

00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:51,780
is the cyclic test with actually will

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:54,720
way didn't compare the caviar Monte with

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:57,930
the CPU partitioning this is because

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:04,050
they are testing results is similar as

00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:06,750
in as in the this is because in our

00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:10,260
testing the tester PMD is a simple

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:12,990
folding application so but in real the

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,940
real villain as they may be complicated

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,610
applications and they have more

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,400
complicated operations so that's why I

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,890
think I still need to put the caviar

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,350
until NTC testing here I mean this

00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,840
testing is not a test with DBT key and

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:31,110
open V switch it's just the key MRT and

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,680
also I compared it with the CP

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:36,990
partitioning the LAN TC value is lower

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:43,110
it's the threshold you know testing

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:46,710
instead to 20 microseconds so this is

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:53,160
the caviar until now this is the results

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:55,520
with configurations so that's all any

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,520
questions

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,750
Linux only Linux no windows yeah

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:32,910
x-wing is a 10 gigabyte the x4 540 yeah

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,910
it's time gigabytes nedovic hard

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,440
okay

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:57,840
so since no questions okay please excuse

00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,840
me could you

00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:09,820
since the modern partner suppose the 40

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:14,650
gigabytes nincada so currently maybe our

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:17,380
our our other teams our network teams

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,970
they are covering this the 40k by metal

00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,810
car I didn't cover it

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:25,120
yeah okay so if you are interested in it

00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:28,120
maybe you can left your email and I can

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:33,160
let them to transfer movie in for us to

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:35,670
you yeah okay so thank you thank you for

00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,670
attending
