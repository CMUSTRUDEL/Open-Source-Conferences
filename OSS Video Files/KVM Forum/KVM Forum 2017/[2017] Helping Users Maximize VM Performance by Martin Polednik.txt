Title: [2017] Helping Users Maximize VM Performance by Martin Polednik
Publication date: 2017-11-04
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	QEMU supports numerous options to fine tune the virtual machine, starting from the big items such as number of CPUs, NUMA nodes or amount of memory all the way down to the choice of USB controllers, disk controllers, and thread pinning. Different use cases require careful tuning to reach desired performance, and certain settings may interfere with configuration's expected performance. Management software can let users fully build the virtual machine, but it may also help them by warning about conflicting or suboptimal choices. In this talk, we will present samples of common configurations, some of them from oVirt users' community, and our ideas how to make their life easier by suggesting changes that should lead to performance improvement in most cases.
