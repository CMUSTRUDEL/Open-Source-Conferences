Title: [2017] Managing the New Block Layer by Kevin Wolf & Max Reitz
Publication date: 2017-11-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	QEMU 2.9 has been a big release for the block layer. With the -blockdev command line option and blockdev-add QMP command declared stable, users get a lot more flexibility in configuring their storage. This is complemented by the new op blockers system that ensures that making use of this flexibility doesn't make the setup unsafe. These changes mean that also the best practices for managing the block layer are changing.

We'll present what the building blocks of the block layer are, how they interact and what is the modern way to use them. We'll also show how we're planning to move forward and build on top of this, for example with dynamic insertion and removal of filter drivers like I/O throttling for any part of the setup.
