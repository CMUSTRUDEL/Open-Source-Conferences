Title: [2017] Instrumenting, Introspection, and Debugging with QEMU by Pavel Dovgalyuk
Publication date: 2017-11-23
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	QEMU is a powerful multi-platform emulation tool, but it lacks debugging and instrumenting capabilities. QEMU includes only GDB server and some execution logging.
Guest code may be instrumented by inserting callbacks and helper instructions into the translated code. In this talk we'll cover the problems that occur when creating the QEMU-based instrumentation tools (instrumenting of the selected processes within VM, analysis with record/replay, intrusive and non-intrusive approaches), and review the existing approaches and insttumentation frameworks (PANDA, DECAF, PinOS, PEMU). We'll also present our efforts in creating instrumentation/introspection plugins for QEMU and adding new debugging stub - WinDbg server.

I am software developer in Institute for System Programming (ISP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS). The activities of the Institute include fundamental research, software development, applied research for the benefits of the Industry, and education.
For the last 7 years I have been working on the project which aim is adding deterministic replay, reverse debugging, instrumentation, instrospection, and analysis to qemu. Part of this work was already included into mainline QEMU.
I presented execution record/replay work on KVM Forum 2014.
