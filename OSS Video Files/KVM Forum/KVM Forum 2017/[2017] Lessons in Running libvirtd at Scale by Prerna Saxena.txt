Title: [2017] Lessons in Running libvirtd at Scale by Prerna Saxena
Publication date: 2017-11-01
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	At Nutanix, we design for scale, and the efficiency of the libvirt/QEMU stack is key to our overall throughput. We primarily consume libvirt qemu driver via a proprietary, distributed orchestrator. We target hyperscale of 1000+ VMs per host. We found that the current handling of QMP asynchronous events has caused the daemon to sporadically lock up under stress. This talk covers ongoing community efforts[1] to improve this. We also advocate scalability improvements with better RPC queuing and streamlined requests. The current queuing model in libvirtd can be overwhelmed with patterns of RPC requests, compromising throughput. Asynchronicity of the daemon is flipped in the current libvirt-client implementation, causing RPCs to appear blocking which they aren't. This talk explores these aspects in detail.
