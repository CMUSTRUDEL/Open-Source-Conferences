Title: [2017] Adding Device Direct Assignment Support for a New Bus Infrastructure on ARM64 by Mike Caraman
Publication date: 2017-11-08
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	Platform and PCI buses are supported for a long time in the Linux kernel and QEMU. While the former is not particularly suited for virtualization, the latter is the main focus of the VFIO framework. Adding device direct assignment support for a new bus infrastructure in the KVM/QEMU PCI centric world comes with challenges: emulation, vIOMMU integration, guest memory attributes support, MSI integration. For high throughput and low latency devices virtualization performance is a key requirement. The second part of the presentation focuses on MSI virtualization performance analysis and tuning on ARM64 for VNF deployments.
