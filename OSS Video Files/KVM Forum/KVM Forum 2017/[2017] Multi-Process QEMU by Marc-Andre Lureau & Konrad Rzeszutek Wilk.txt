Title: [2017] Multi-Process QEMU by Marc-Andre Lureau & Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk

Description: 
	QEMU is a large program, that links with hundreds of libraries. Over a million lines of C code in a single process, to hold a VM: this brings a lot of room for security vulnerabilities, even when using sandboxing. Sandboxing has to be quite permissive for all the code, and doesn't prevent QEMU from crashing. Having a single process also means it is harder to run concurrent work and schedule it well, or could lead to more memory fragmentation. QEMU could use multiple processes for various tasks, like device emulation. vhost-user is a solution for virtio devices, mostly used for networking, but can be applied to other kind of devices. This brings modularity, and allow device emulation to exist in external projects. However, new interfaces would have to be created for other kind of devices and tasks.
