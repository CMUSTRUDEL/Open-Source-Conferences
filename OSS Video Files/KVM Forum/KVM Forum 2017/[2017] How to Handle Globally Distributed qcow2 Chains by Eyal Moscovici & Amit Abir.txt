Title: [2017] How to Handle Globally Distributed qcow2 Chains by Eyal Moscovici & Amit Abir
Publication date: 2017-11-16
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	In Oracle Ravello we leverage QCOW2 and the public cloud Object Storage as the backbone of our virtual cloud block storage. Guest disk images are stored in QCOW2 chains that are distributed globally across multiple regions of the cloud's object storage. Long chains incur performance penalty and larger memory consumption. However, shortening the chains is not trivial.
