Title: [2017] Linux-User Support in QEMU by Riku Voipio
Publication date: 2017-11-23
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	The roots of KVM are in Qemu, which was originally written as an emulator for running X86 Linux binaries on foreign architectures. Today linux-user emulation has become a sidenote in Qemu development, which tends to focus on Virtualization features. In this presentation Riku will review the current state of user-mode emulation and what use cases it still has. Riku will show how user-mode contributions can be tested and validated. Finally there will be a look forward, on how linux-user code can be improved, and discussion on it's place in greater Qemu/KVM ecosystem.
