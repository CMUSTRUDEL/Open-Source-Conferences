Title: [2017] Nested Virtualization on ARM by Christoffer Dall
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	ARM recently introduced nested virtualization support in the latest ARMv8.3 revision of the architecture. We will present the initial effort to introduce ARM nested virtualization support to KVM/ARM, which involves adding significant logic to core KVM/ARM code, MMU support, timers, and the GIC emulation. We will also briefly discuss a paravirtualization approach used to prototype and evaluate the implementation on current ARMv8 hardware without hardware support for nested virtualization. We will present some preliminary results and discuss their implications.
