Title: [2017] QEMU in UEFI - Alexander Graf
Publication date: 2017-11-13
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	UEFI is a firmware specification created by Intel with portability in mind. The UEFI way of doing that was to provide special UEFI byte code (EBC). Unfortunately nobody really cared so compiler, firmware support and providers of EBC option roms ceased and basically every UEFI option rom today contains native x86(_64) machine code. If you now want to plug a PCIe card into your shiny ARM server, that means even though firmware would be compatible it still can't execute the option rom. Until you add QEMU to the mix. Join me in exploring the depth of UEFI binary interfaces, marshalling between different architecture's function call ABIs on the fly and learn how to integrate all of this into a working firmware, running on real hardware, driving a real PCIe adapter.

Alexander started working for SUSE about 9 years ago. Since then he worked on fancy things like SUSE Studio, QEMU, KVM and openSUSE on ARM. Whenever something really useful comes to his mind, he tends to implement it. Among others he did Mac OS X virtualization using KVM, nested SVM, KVM on PowerPC and a lot of work in QEMU for openSUSE on ARM. He is the upstream maintainer of KVM for PowerPC, QEMU for PowerPC and QEMU for S390x.
