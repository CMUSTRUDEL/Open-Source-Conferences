Title: [2017] vIOMMU ARM: Full Emulation and virtio-iommu Approaches by Eric Auger
Publication date: 2017-11-13
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	Exposing a virtual IOMMU to a QEMU/KVM guest has been enabled on several architectures and ARM support is looming. This is required for DPDK nested device assignment, nested virtualization and virtio traffic isolation.

On ARM, two approaches are considered: QEMU SMMUv3 full emulation and virtio paravirtualized approach. Full emulation is the solution traditionally adopted by other architectures while the second is a new approach.

To determine if the new virtio-iommu approach is viable, we are also working on a proof of concept on x86, where its performance can be compared with the existing VT-d full emulation solution.

We will present the status of the virtio-iommu integration on x86 and both technical solutions on ARM. We will list pros and cons and provide a first performance analysis.

Eric has been involved in KVM/QEMU since March 2014. He started as a Linaro assignee and currently works for Red Hat, in the Virtualization team. Eric has contributed to VFIO, KVM/ARM and QEMU. He has been mainly
busy with platform and PCIe device assignment for ARM. He has contributed to the virtual GIC interrupt controller, added features missing for passthrough, vhost-net, MSI support. He has been integrating the vITS KVM MSI controller device in QEMU and working on its migration. Latterly Eric has been working on enabling vIOMMU on ARM.
