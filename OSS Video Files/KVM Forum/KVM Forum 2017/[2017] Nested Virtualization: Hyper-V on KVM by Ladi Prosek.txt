Title: [2017] Nested Virtualization: Hyper-V on KVM by Ladi Prosek
Publication date: 2017-11-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	Nested virtualization has been becoming increasingly important. As operating systems have started adopting virtualization-based security features, running a hypervisor as a guest of another hypervisor is no longer just a novelty with little use outside of test environments.

In this talk, Ladi Prosek will briefly describe the architecture of Microsoft Hyper-V as well as virtualization-based features introduced in Microsoft's latest server and desktop operating systems. He will review the work done in KVM so far to support running such systems as KVM/QEMU guests, describe general challenges accommodating non-KVM L1 hypervisors, and present future opportunities in this area.
