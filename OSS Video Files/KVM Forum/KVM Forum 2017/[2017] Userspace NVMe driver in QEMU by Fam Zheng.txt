Title: [2017] Userspace NVMe driver in QEMU by Fam Zheng
Publication date: 2017-11-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	Just like how DPDK enables userspace applications to archieve fast networking, VFIO and SPDK makes it feasible for a virtual machine to use host's NVMe devices to back the virtual disk thus allows for better performance/flexibility balance. In this presentation, Fam Zheng will explore the integration of QEMU block layer with VFIO and SPDK, discuss the challenges hidden in the details, compare the result with linux-aio and PCI passthrough and talk about the further work.
