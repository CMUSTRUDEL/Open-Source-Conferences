Title: [2017] Towards a More Expressive and Introspectable QEMU Command Line by Markus Armbruster
Publication date: 2017-11-22
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	QEMU command line interface is large and increasingly complex. The infrastructure supporting it no longer meets the growing demands: it is insufficiently expressive for some configuration needs, and its introspection features are inadequate.

In this presentation, we will briefly explore how the command line traditionally works, and where it falls short. I will then present ongoing work to make it match QMP in expressiveness and introspection features. Customary ritual sacrifice to backward compatibility will be performed throughout.
