Publication date: 2017-11-21
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	This talk will cover the challenge of improving VNFs safety relying on Virtio and Vhost-user backend on host side.
Maxime will first provide a brief overview of a VNF architecture relying on Virtio/Vhost-user, to take the opportunity to highlight the possible safety concerns.
In a second time, he will talk about new developments that introduces IOMMU support to Vhost-user backend, as a follow-up of last year talk from Peter Xu and Wei Xu about introducing IOMMU support for Vhost-kernel backend, and will provide some benchmarks to show the impact of enabling this feature.
Finally, Maxime will talk about the remaining safety and performance gaps, and present the envisaged ways to fill them.
