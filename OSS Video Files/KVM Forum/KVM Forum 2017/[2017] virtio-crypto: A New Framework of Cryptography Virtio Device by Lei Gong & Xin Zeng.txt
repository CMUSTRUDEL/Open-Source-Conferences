Title: [2017] virtio-crypto: A New Framework of Cryptography Virtio Device by Lei Gong & Xin Zeng
Publication date: 2017-11-21
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	Tranditional teloc equipments use lots of hardware accelerators, how to leverage these accelerators becomes important in Network Function Virtualization(NFV). We are trying to implement a software solution based on KVM, to offload specific processing like encryption/decryption, media transcoding etc, this prestation will introduce an para-virtualization scheme of hardware accelerator, including introducing virtio frontend driver and backend device, making use of Linux kernel cryptography framework in the relization of virtio crypto frontend driver. I will present the advantages and current status of virtio crypto device, show the performance figure which compared to plain-soft scheme etc.
