Title: [2017] Live Migration with Mediated Device by Yulei Zhang

Description: 
	Mediated device is a new feature introduced in VFIO for efficient I/O sharing in virtualization environment. For example, it’s a key enabling technology to GPU virtualization for cloud graphics, media processing and computing. However mediated device doesn’t support live migration today, which is a key gap in data center and cloud usages.
In this talk we will introduce the challenges and gaps about how to live migrate mediated device, and then elaborate the techniques by extending VFIO mdev framework to bridge the gaps. Our work is based on Intel GVT-g (a.k.a KVMGT) which is Intel’s vGPU implementation using mediated device technique. By proving the feasibility on the most complex I/O device, we believe other mediated devices can leverage same technique to enable live migration usage. A simple demo video will also be provided to demonstrate the feature.
