Title: [2017] Zero-Copy Receive for vhost by Mike Rapoport
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	In para-virtual networking with virtio-net/vhost, the copying of packet between the hypervisor and the guest is one of the major sources of the overhead, especially for the large packets. And, although, zero-copy transmit was merged into the Linux kernel a few years ago, the "receive side zero copy" item is still in the KVM NetworkingTodo.

This talk presents an approach to implementation of zero-copy receive for virtio-net and vhost that leverages receive-side steering abilities of the modern high speed network cards.
