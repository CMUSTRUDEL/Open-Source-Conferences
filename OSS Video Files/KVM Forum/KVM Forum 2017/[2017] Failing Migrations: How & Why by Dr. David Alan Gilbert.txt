I'm a Principal Software Engineer for Red Hat, based in Manchester, UK. I work in the migration sub-team. My main tasks are looking after Postcopy migration and ensuring migration compatibility between our QEMU versions. I previously spoke (with Andrea Arcangeli) at KVM Forum 2014 on the implementation of postcopy.
