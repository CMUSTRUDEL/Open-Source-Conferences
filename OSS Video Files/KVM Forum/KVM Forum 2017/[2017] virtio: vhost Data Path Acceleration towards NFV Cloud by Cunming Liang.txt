Title: [2017] virtio: vhost Data Path Acceleration towards NFV Cloud by Cunming Liang
Publication date: 2017-11-21
Playlist: KVM Forum 2017
Description: 
	VIRTIO as a para-virtualized device decouples VMs and physical devices. Friendly live-migration support makes it well recognized by the cloud networking. However, the north-south I/O throughput of VIRTIO doesnâ€™t compare with SR-IOV.
The technical talk gives a practical proposal to address this by introducing a framework for vhost data path offloading. It essentially allows using HW device to offload the vring data path on the vhost side, without requiring the HW device being pass-thru to the guest. As a result, it achieves SR-IOV like performance with compatible live-migration support which makes it possible to upgrade a stock VM using virtio to a new HW accelerated platform transparently.
Steve is going to explain the mechanism under the hood, go through the detail proposal, introduce the benefits, and share the WIP patch work and figure out the minimum HW prerequisite for doing this.

Platform Solution Architect

Steve is Intel platform solution architecture for DPDK. He spends years on packet I/O performance optimization (e.g. vector PMD), I/O virtualization and core efficiency for DPDK. He used to work on the estimation/tuning/optimization of user space stack for workloads (e.g. L7 load balance). He addressed the virtualization/container story for DPDK, as one of the major input to define DPDK road map for that piece. The recent focus area is packet processing w/ HW acceleration or on the heterogeneous platform. He delivered a few presentation on DPDK China Summit, DPDK US Summit, OPNFV DPDK/FD.IO Mini Summit.
