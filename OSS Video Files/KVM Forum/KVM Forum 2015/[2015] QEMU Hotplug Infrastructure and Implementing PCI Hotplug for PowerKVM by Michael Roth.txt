Title: [2015] QEMU Hotplug Infrastructure and Implementing PCI Hotplug for PowerKVM by Michael Roth
Publication date: 2015-09-05
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	Just as with physical machines, the ability to hotplug resources into virtual machines is a commonly used and often critical feature for allowing users to modify network/storage/cpu/memory configurations for running guest instances without incurring unecessary downtime. This talk provides an overview of the infrastructure within QEMU to handle hotplug/unplug operations, device lifecycles, and how this infrastructure is used for various platforms/resources. It will also go into detail on how this infrastructure was used for implementing PCI hotplug for PowerKVM guests.
