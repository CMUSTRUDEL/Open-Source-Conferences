	Getting Started with Coccinelle (KVM edition)

Coccinelle is a program matching and transformation tool for C programs that has been extensively applied to the Linux kernel and is used on a number of other C code bases. Coccinelle makes it easy to specify software specific rules for finding bugs and for updating software to use new APIs. These rules can then be applied automatically across an entire code base. Over 40 Coccinelle rules are already available in the Linux kernel source code and Coccinelle has been used in the development of Qemu. The goal of this hands-on tutorial is to enable developers to write their own rules. We will focus on the BiteSizedTasks from the Qemu wiki. Participants should have Coccinelle (available via most Linux distributions) and a recent version of the Qemu source code installed on their machines.
