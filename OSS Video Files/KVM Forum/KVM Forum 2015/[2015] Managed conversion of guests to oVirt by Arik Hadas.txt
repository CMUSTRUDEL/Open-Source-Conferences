Description: 
	Due to the different standards and tools that are being used by different hypervisors, the conversion of a guest from one hypervisor to another is a complex task. To do it efficiently, one will need to use a conversion tool, such as virt-v2v that converts guests to be compatible for running on KVM and being managed by oVirt. In this presentation Arik Hadas will present the upcoming integration between oVirt and virt-v2v which produces an integrated process in oVirt to convert guests from different hypervisors, discuss the improvements it introduces comparing to the previous process, demonstrate how guest is converted from vSphere to oVirt using oVirt's admin portal, and discuss possible ways the process can be enhanced with additional capabilities and to support additional sources to convert guests from.
