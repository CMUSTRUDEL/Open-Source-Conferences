Title: [2015] Status update on KVM-COLO HA FT solution by Hongyang Yang, Eddie Dong and Weidong Han
Publication date: 2015-09-02
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	COLO is a VM replication technique which provides application-agnostic software-implemented hardware fault tolerance "non-stop service". Under COLO mode, both primary VM (PVM) and secondary VM (SVM) are run in parallel. They receive the same request from client, and generate response in parallel too. If the response packets from PVM and SVM are identical, they are released immediately. Otherwise, a VM checkpoint (on demand) is conducted. COLO patches for QEMU have already been sent to the dev maillist and are under review. In this talk, we will talk about the COLO implementation in QEMU, the new designed block replication, discussing on problems we've met while developing COLO. Apart from the technical part, we will also present the latest progress from Fujitsu, Intel and Huawei. For more info, refer to COLO project wiki: http://wiki.qemu.org/Features/COLO
