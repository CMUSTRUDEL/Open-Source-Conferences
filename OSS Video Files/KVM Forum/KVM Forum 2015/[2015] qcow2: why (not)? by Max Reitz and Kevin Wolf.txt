Title: [2015] qcow2: why (not)? by Max Reitz and Kevin Wolf
Publication date: 2015-08-27
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	Full backups of large storage devices are expensive, slow, and waste a lot of space needlessly by copying sectors that have not changed over and over again. Incremental and differential backups are an oft requested feature in QEMU, and will help eliminate the redundant copying of backup data. This presentation will cover recent developments in related delta-backup technologies, covering incremental and differential backups, image fleecing, and dirty bitmap management. We will highlight how these features are accomplished using modifications to existing QMP primitives such as the 'drive-backup' and 'transaction' commands to unlock rich functionality within our existing APIs.
