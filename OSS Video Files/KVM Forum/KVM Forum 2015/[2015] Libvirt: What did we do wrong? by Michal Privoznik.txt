Description: 
	Libvirt is a mature project which started back in 2005. However, because it was only a Xen wrapper initially, many APIs were too tied to the Xen world. But that was not the only problem, we have made some major errors even fairly recently. And it's not bugs what I have in ming here. It's API design issues, broken XML schema and others. What was the source of that problems and more interestingly, how can we avoid (most of) them repeating in the future? Lets not repeat those mistakes in other projects too.
