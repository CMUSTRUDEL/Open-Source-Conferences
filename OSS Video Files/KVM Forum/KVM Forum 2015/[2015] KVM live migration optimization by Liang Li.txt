Description: 
	Live migration plays a very important role in cloud computing technology. It facilitates maintenance, load balancing, hardware failover, energy saving and geographic migration. Because the application areas are so wide, the live migration function should be made flexible enough to meet the performance requirements of different usages. In this presentation, we would like to give the details of the multiple thread compression mechanism on KVM/QEMU which helps to reduce the total migration time, VM downtime and network traffic. We will also mention how to use Intelâ€™s hardware (de)compression accelerator and the optimized algorithm to reduce the CPU usage in live migration, and live migration based on DPDK which can make full use of the 10/40 Gigabit NICs (Network Interface Cards). At last, we will show some data of performance gain of these optimizations.
