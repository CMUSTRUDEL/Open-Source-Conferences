Title: [2015] Backing Chain management in QEMU and libvirt by Eric Blake
Publication date: 2015-09-08
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	Backing Chains form the backbone of guest storage backups, snapshots, live storage migration, and even some promising new technologies like course-grained lock-step redundancy for better guest failover between hosts. In this presentation, Eric Blake will review how qcow2 backing chains work, and how basic operations such as stream, copy, commit, and dirty bitmaps are combined under management software like libvirt to perform several useful operations on guest storage. Visualizing where guest data lives, and how a given qcow2 file represents all data changes from a set point in time, can be helpful in determining which operation is best for a task at hand.

I have worked with libvirt and qemu since 2010 as part of the Red Hat virtualization team. My focus is on interface design for ensuring that libvirt can manage qemu efficiently, as well as libvirt management of block storage solutions. Previous conference presentations include Linux Plumber's Conference in 2012, and KVM Forum in 2013.
