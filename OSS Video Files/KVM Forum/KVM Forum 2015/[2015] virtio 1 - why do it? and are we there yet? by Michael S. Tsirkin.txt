Description: 
	The purpose of VIRTIO is to ensure that virtual environments and guests have a straightforward, efficient, standard, and extensible mechanism for virtual devices. First version of the Virtio 1 specification was approved a year ago: 31 August 2014. In this presentation, Michael S. Tsirkin will review the features and benefits of the virtio 1 specification, provide an update on the current status of the implementations and the challenges they face and look forwad to how we may address those challenges. Michael will review the new developments in virtio since the first release, and suggest ways one can contribute to virtio development.
