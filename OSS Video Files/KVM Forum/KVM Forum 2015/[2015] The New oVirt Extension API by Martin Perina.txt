Title: [2015] The New oVirt Extension API by Martin Perina
Publication date: 2015-09-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	Prior to version 3.5 oVirt did not have a standard API for creating custom modules/extension. There were some parts of oVirt that allowed limited extensibility like UI plugins or VDSM hooks, but there was no standard solution. In this session we will take a look at the new extension API introduced in oVirt 3.5. We will take a look at the features this API offers and we will demonstrate how to create new extension. We will also take a look at the different functionality in oVirt that already leverages this API, like AAA and logging, and will present our future plans around it.
