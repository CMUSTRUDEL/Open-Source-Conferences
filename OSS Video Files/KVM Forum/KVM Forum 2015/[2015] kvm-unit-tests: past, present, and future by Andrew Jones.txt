Description: 
	Mammas don't let your babies grow up to... write code without corresponding unit tests. Only cowboys/girls sling code without testing it. But, who has the time to write features, fixes, *and* tests? For KVM, we all do, because with kvm-unit-tests, test writing is quick, and fun. Beyond verification, kvm-unit-tests is an invaluable tool for micro-benchmarking, more fun. In this presentation, Drew describes the original framework, which started with x86 unit tests five years ago, giving examples of some test cases. Then, he describes the support for arm and aarch64 unit tests, which he recently contributed, and extends the framework in several ways. Finally, he presents the current status of a new initiative; adding support for powerpc.
