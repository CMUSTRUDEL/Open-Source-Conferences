	Avocado: Next generation virt testing

In the beginning of the KVM test efforts, there was KVM autotest. The framework evolved, and today, we have virt-test. Virt-test has a test matrix that spawns 1800 tests for QEMU and 7800 tests for libvirt, with active usage and development by testing teams and key virt stack developers. It's a sucessful and established project, but we can do even better. Enters Avocado (http://avocado framework.github.io/), a new test framework with a smart test runner, easier to use and more extensible than the previous framework used, Autotest. Besides being developer friendly, it also meets the needs of QE teams. Avocado-virt is an extension (APIs and plugins) that allows virt tests to be executed alongside other tests supported by Avocado. This presentation will cover the base Avocado tools, together with the capabilities of the Virt extension, including the new APIs for virt test writers.
