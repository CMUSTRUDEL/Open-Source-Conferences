Description: 
	Virt-v2v converts guests from VMware, Xen and Hyper-V, OVAs and physical machines, so they run efficiently on KVM. It can export to OpenStack, RHEV (oVirt), libvirt, plain qemu-system-xx or local disk. This 30 minute presentation discusses the technology behind this, and how we use qemu features like the curl & ssh drivers, copy-on-read, discard support and qcow2 v3 to make it possible to rapidly import thousands of guests from VMware and Xen over to KVM.
