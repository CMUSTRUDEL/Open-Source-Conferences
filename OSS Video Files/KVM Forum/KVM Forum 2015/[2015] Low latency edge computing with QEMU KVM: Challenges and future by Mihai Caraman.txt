Title: [2015] Low latency edge computing with QEMU KVM: Challenges and future by Mihai Caraman
Publication date: 2015-09-08
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	Technical talk: Virtualization and software defined networks provides the foundation for new paradigms to flourish. Edge computing provides low latency services moving them closer to user and hardware consolidation moving disaggregated services to resource pools. In this presentation Mihai Caraman will discuss the challenges encountered porting KVM to real-time kernel for ARMv8 and Power Architectures, the support added for direct-assigned SR-IOV PCI devices with IOMMU, optimizations done for low latency guest interrupts and how services like Open vSwitch were offloaded into hardware. He will present how these VMs are used at the edge of a 4G+ network to handle secure LTE traffic and to chain services with low latency requirement, and the extensions added in OpenStack to represent them. The presentation will cover aspects related to optimizations, scaling and performance tuning.
