Title: [2015] QEMU for Xilinx ZynqMP by Edgar E. Iglesias
Publication date: 2015-08-27
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	QEMU for Xilinx ZynqMP QEMU can be a great tool to enable early software development for hardware that is still under design. In this talk, Edgar will cover some of the challenges we faced and the solutions we chose when using QEMU to model the Xilinx ZynqMP SoC. The topics will include:

* ARMv8 TrustZone and Virtualization modeling
* Per CPU/Master address-spaces and Memory Attributes
* Modeling of Heterogeneous CPU architectures
* Real-life Co-simulation of QEMU with System-C and RTL (with open-source tools)
* Machine creation from Flat Device Trees
* Binary tracing and code-coverage

The talk will also go through our collaboration with upstream, upstreams current state and future challenges in these areas.
