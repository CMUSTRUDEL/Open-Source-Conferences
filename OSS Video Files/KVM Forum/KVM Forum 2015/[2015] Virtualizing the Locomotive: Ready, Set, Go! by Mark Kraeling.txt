Title: [2015] Virtualizing the Locomotive: Ready, Set, Go! by Mark Kraeling
Publication date: 2015-09-02
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	Virtualization has so far been largely absent on locomotives in North America. As railroad customers move to view their locomotives as networked assets, and with the introduction of concepts such as mobile data centers, In 2015, standard platforms will be deployed by GE that utilize Xen for x86-based processors, and KVM for ARM-based processors. This end-user session will discuss the desired features that are needed for a hypervisor, the enhancements that could be considered in the locomotive real-time environment, and the applications that will utilize this technology. Finally, as an option, actual locomotive control systems equipment will be brought to the presentation to show a quick demonstration of the applications, how they communicate data off-board, and the industrial hardware that it runs on.
