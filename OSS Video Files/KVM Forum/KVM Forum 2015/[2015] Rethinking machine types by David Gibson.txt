Title: [2015] Rethinking machine types by David Gibson

Description: 
	qemu's QOM device model can describe virtual hardware in a way which is reasonably discoverable and consistent across devices and and architectures. This exists somewhat uneasily with the code for machine types which implement platform specific initialization, but can impose constraints which are not easily discoverable. Converting machine types to scripts describing the machine's devices has been discussed in the past, but it's not clear that will be practical soon or ever. This presentation suggests approaches for making machine types work better with QOM, based in part on the experience of integrating support for many different embedded machines into the Linux kernel in arch/powerpc. These approaches might also allow improved communication of virtual hardware description outside qemu; both "upwards" to libvirt and management agents, and "downwards" to the virtual guest OS.
