Title: [2015] Migrating NFV applications to KVM Guest by Mario Smarduch

Description: 
	Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) promises to extend the network management benefits that are currently enjoyed in IT environments, but so far the focus has mostly been on the cloud portion of NFV with little effort being spent on the hypervisor, guest, and emulation layers. You can't simply move an NFV application from native environments to guest environments because it will be bound to fail, or at best, perform sporadically. This presentation will address the subtle differences between native and virtualized behaviors by systematically walking through guest, hypervisor, and emulation features. In addition, it will cover the challenges encountered by typical state machine protocols, real-time applications, and guests that deal with passed-through devices. Lastly, this talk will propose enhancements to all levels of the virtualization stack and application design.
