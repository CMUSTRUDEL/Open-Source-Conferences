Publication date: 2015-09-05
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	Scalability of virtual machines has become a growing trend. QEMU is able to hot-add x86 vCPUs during runtime. The ability to hot-remove x86 vCPUs is being prepared. Larger discussions are ongoing for how to bring CPU hot-plug to further architectures and for how management interfaces like libvirt can drive and monitor vCPUs. This presentation will provide an overview of the currently available CPU hot-plug features as well as remaining challenges and possible solutions.
