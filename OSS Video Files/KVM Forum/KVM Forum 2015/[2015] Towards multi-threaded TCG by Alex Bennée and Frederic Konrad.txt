Title: [2015] Towards multi-threaded TCG by Alex Bennée and Frederic Konrad
Publication date: 2015-09-05
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	While QEMU has continued to be optimised for KVM to make use of the growing number of cores on modern systems TCG emulation has been stuck running in a single thread. This year there is another push to get a workable solution merged upstream. We shall present a review of the challenges that need to be addressed: locking, TLB and cache maintenance and generic solution for the various atomic/exclusive operations. We will discuss previous work that has been done in this field before presenting a design that addresses these requirements. Finally we shall look at the current proposed patches and the design decisions they have taken.

Alex Bennée
Senior Software Engineer, Linaro
Alex is a senior software engineer working in Linaro's Virtualization team. | An experienced FLOSS developer with over 20 years of experience in embedded | and systems programming he currently spends most of his time on QEMU's TCG | based emulation. The first piece of assembly he wrote was for the 6809 in his | Dragon 32 followed by excessive pixel flinging on the 68000 before x86 took | over the world.

Frederic Konrad
Fred is a software engineer which is mostly interested in hardware 
simulation projects like QEMU and SystemC. He is one of the contributor to MTTCG as it's a really interesting way to speed up the simulation.
