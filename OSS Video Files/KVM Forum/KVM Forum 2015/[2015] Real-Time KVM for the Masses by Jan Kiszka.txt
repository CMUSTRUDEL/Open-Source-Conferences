Title: [2015] Real-Time KVM for the Masses by Jan Kiszka
Publication date: 2015-08-25
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	There are more and more reasons to improve KVM for hosting guests with real-time requirements, like migrating existing RT systems or virtualizing network functions. Many low-level optimizations have been done already. What is missing yet is integration with a complete management stack so that users do not have to tune every detail themselves. In this talk, we will present concepts and first results of an ongoing project to enable a stack of Preempt-RT Linux, QEMU/KVM, libvirt and OpenStack for RT CPU and network virtualization. Derived from a generic use case, we will describe UI extensions and changes to other OpenStack services. We will look into new tasks of libvirt when applying real-time on the computing nodes. We will describe the integration with QEMU/KVM and provide an update on the RT quality level that can be achieved. Our talk closes with plans and ideas for future work.
