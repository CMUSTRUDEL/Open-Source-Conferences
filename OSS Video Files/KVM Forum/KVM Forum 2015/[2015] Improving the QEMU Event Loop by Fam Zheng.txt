Title: [2015] Improving the QEMU Event Loop by Fam Zheng
Publication date: 2015-09-10
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	The event loop is the center of QEMU which drives all subsystems in an emulated system, by watching for and dispatching the asynchronous events. Therefore, it affects the programs, capability, performance and efficiency. In this presentation, Fam Zheng will explain how the event based model fits in the program architecture, discuss the challenges of the event loop in the contexts of scalability and data-plane, and look at the relevant work that may address these challenges.
