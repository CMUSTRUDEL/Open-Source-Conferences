Title: [2015] QEMU interface introspection: from hacks to solutions by Markus Armbruster
Publication date: 2015-09-05
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	QEMU sports many compile-time configuration knobs, and is evolving rapidly. Software interfacing with QEMU frequently needs to figure out whether certain features or interfaces are available in a particular binary. The presenter will take you on a journey from the entertaining hacks of old to the much more robust (if less entertaining) interface introspection of today and the near future.
