Description: 
	We were asked to come up with a solution to setting up a cluster where storage, management and VMs are running together on small number of nodes. This solution is currently known as hyper converged architecture. This kind of setup seems to be getting quite common in small deployments, but it was not possible to use it and maintain all oVirt reliability features until now. This presentation will be about the design, configuration and installation of the minimal possible reliable cluster using three hyper converged hosts with oVirt as the software stack and Gluster for the storage - all running together in highly available setup across all three nodes.
