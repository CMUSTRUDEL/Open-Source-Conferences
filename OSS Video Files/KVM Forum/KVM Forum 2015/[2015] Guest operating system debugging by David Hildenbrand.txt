Description: 
	Debugging operating systems is a non-trivial task and requires good tooling support. Access to vital information is often cumbersome or restricted, and areas like early boot code are inaccessible. Classical debugging techniques rely on a still somewhat functioning target system, which makes debugging in some scenarios impossible. But virtualization gives access to a whole new set of debugging techniques, some of them even exploiting specialized hardware support. This talk outlines typical debugging scenarios and identifies areas where virtualization specific debugging techniques, like guest profiling, guest tracing or interactive guest debugging, can be the better choice. KVM on z Systems is used to show what is currently possible, how it is used in practice, and what could be done in that area in the future.
