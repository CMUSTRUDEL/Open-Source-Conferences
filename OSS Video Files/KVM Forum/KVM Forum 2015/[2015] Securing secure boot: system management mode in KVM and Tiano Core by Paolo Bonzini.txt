Title: [2015] Securing secure boot: system management mode in KVM and Tiano Core by Paolo Bonzini
Publication date: 2015-09-10
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	UEFI secure boot has been a hot topic for several years, but the dust is settling and it is relatively easy to boot a signed kernel on a bare metal system. However, support for secure boot in virtual machines is still in the experimental stage, and serious holes in the implementation are found even on bare metal machines. This talk will introduce secure boot concepts, present vulnerabilities that were discovered in UEFI implementations, and explain how they can be solved for x86 virtual machines running under the KVM hypervisor.
