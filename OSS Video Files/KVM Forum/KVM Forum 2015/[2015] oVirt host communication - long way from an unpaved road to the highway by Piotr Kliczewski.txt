Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	oVirt project is a distributed system where synchronous communication became a bottleneck. In this talk we will look at the architectural evolution we did in oVirt, from synchronous HTTP based RPC to reactive streams. We will explore the pros and cons of each alternative and understand decisions we have chosen on the road.
