Title: [2015] ARM interrupt virtualization by Andre Przywara
Publication date: 2015-09-10
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	With the introduction of the ARM virtualization extension the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller provided also hardware support to help a hypervisor with interrupt virtualization. The talk will briefly describe these capabilities and the original design of the KVM code required to support it. With the advancement of the hardware capabilities however extending the code proved to be challenging, so the talk will then give an overview of the design changes proposed to help current and future extensions, which is an ongoing effort.

Andre Przywara works in the ARM Linux kernel team in Cambridge/UK, primarily on KVM, but also on other parts of the kernel. Recent work included extending the virtualization support for the ARM interrupt controller.
Before joining ARM Andre spent a year in an early-bird ARM server company, while being assigned to the Linaro group.
He gained much experience and knowledge in Linux, KVM, QEMU and Xen while working for AMD in the six years before, mainly, but not exclusively contributing to x86 hardware virtualization code in those projects.
