Description: 
	The self-hosted engine approach consists of an oVirt virtualization cluster that serves up a VM running its own management engine. A recent users survey shows up that this is really a popular deployment schema among many oVirt users. oVirt node is an oVirt sub-project aimed toward building a small, robust operating system image to be use to easily deploy virtualization hosts. oVirtAppliance is complete pre installed oVirt management engine ready to be configured and run as VM. This session will show how we can use parametric answer files, cloud-init and other technologies to better collate these projects in order to provide a seamless deployment experience getting from bare metal to a fully configured oVirt instance with just a few human actions.
