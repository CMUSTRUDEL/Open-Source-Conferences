Title: [2015] KVM Message Passing Performance by David Matlack
Publication date: 2015-09-04
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	Message Passing (inter-process communication and event-driven) Workloads can be more than 2x slower in KVM guests than native, even when virtual IO devices are not involved. Not only is this bad for performance, it is very counter-intuitive. This talk will cover: * The KVM overheads of Message Passing Workloads (using loopback TCP_RR as an example). * The lifetime and performance of a guest HLT, including the guest's interactions with its local APIC for wakeups. * The effects of a tickless (no-hz) guest kernel on message passing performance. * Plans to improve performance from within KVM. The meat of the talk will be x86 (Intel) specific, but the concepts should apply to most architectures. Note: unlike Rik van Riel's talk from 2013 the workloads discussed in this talk don't depend on the performance of the FPU.
