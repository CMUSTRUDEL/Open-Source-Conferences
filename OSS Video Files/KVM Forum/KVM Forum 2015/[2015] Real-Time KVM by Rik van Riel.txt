Publication date: 2015-08-25
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	KVM is now suitable for low latency real time workloads. Getting there required several changes to the code, which are now now upstream. Real time KVM also requires very careful system configuration. This presentation will describe some of the issues faced (and fixed) during development, pitfalls in deploying real time KVM (and how to avoid them), as well as some of the automation available to easily deploy real time KVM.
