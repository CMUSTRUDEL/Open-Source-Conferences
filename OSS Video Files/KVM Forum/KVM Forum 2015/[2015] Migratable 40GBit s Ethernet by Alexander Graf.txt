Description: 
	Networking is a challenging field. You usually want to get low latencies, fast throughput and total flexibility on which physical machine a virtual machine is located on. Getting everything at once can prove extremely difficult though. This talk shows some options we have in improving the situation. It shows benchmarks on different approaches in making networking going faster by cutting different layers to analyze where we need to focus on to get towards the next level of performance.
