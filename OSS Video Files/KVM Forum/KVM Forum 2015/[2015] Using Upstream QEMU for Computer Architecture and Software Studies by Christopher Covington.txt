Title: [2015] Using Upstream QEMU for Computer Architecture and Software Studies by Christopher Covington
Publication date: 2015-09-02
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	There have been repeated efforts to make QEMU useful for computer architecture and software studies, but little of this has successfully been merged upstream. Christopher Covington will discuss example use cases, such as fast forwarding, instruction and data tracing, and basic block vector collection. He will go on to describe past and present efforts to merge such functionality upstream, including ARM PMU and ETM hardware emulation, and solicit suggestions for future work.

Christopher Covington
I am employed by Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc. but don a Linaro hat for QEMU contributions. My current work involves using the Linux kernel, VirtIO-MMIO, QEMU system emulation, and Checkpoint and Restore In Userspace (CRIU) to enable computer architecture and software optimization studies. I have previously spoken at the Linux Plumbers Conference.
