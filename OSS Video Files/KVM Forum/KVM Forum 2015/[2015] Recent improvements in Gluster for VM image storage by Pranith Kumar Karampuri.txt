Description: 
	In this talk, Pranith Kumar K will discuss significant enhancements to Gluster for being a backend store for KVM images. Gluster 3.7 introduced features like sharding, arbiter replication amongst others which make it more attractive for storing KVM images. In addition to detailing these features, we will also talk about issues identified while using a Gluster backend and how we have addressed them for robustness while being highly available and performant as a backend. We would like to touch upon hyper convergence story with gluster and ovirt if time permits.
