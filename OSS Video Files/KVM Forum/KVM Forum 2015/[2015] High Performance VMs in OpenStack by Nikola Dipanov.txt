Title: [2015] High Performance VMs in OpenStack by Nikola Dipanov
Publication date: 2015-09-11
Playlist: KVM Forum 2015
Description: 
	With the rise of the adoption of the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) model of managing hardware resources by an ever increasing number of industries, workload performance requirements do not decrease. While happy to embrace the flexibility this model provides, the need for near-metal performance is becoming apparent, as industries try to move more and more traditional workloads into "the cloud". As one of the leading open source cloud projects, OpenStack has been hard at work over the last two releases, exposing features that support high performance workloads, provided by libvirt/KVM. This talk will aim to give an overview of several of these features (NUMA awareness, CPU pinning, and large pages support) added to OpenStack Nova in the 'Juno' and 'Kilo' releases. It will also try to highlight some of the challenges of such features in an IaaS context.
