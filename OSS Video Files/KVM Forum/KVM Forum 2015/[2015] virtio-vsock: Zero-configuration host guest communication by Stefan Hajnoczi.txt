Description: 
	Modern hypervisors provide services beyond bare virtualized machine environments, like application-consistent backups and guest monitoring. These services involve host/guest communication that has typically been implemented using the virtio-serial device. The virtio-vsock device introduces a new host/guest communication mechanism which, unlike virtio-serial, supports the sockets API. Application code written for the sockets API can be ported with minimal effort. virtio-vsock also differentiates itself from emulated network interface cards because no changes to guest network configuration are required. This makes virtio-vsock more robust and convenient than virtio-serial or emulated network interface cards. This presentation covers virtio-vsock in the context of QEMU Guest Agent and file sharing, two use cases that can benefit from this new virtio device.
