Publication date: 2014-10-20
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	As KVM is increasingly adopted by businesses and other organizations for virtualization, and is the most popular hypervisor for OpenStack deployments, there is real value in bringing together high performance end users with the leading KVM community developers.

This panel of KVM end users aims to encourage these conversations by sharing experience of KVM practical deployments, KVM in new technologies, identifying KVM technical needs, and discussing how developers and end users can work together to help make KVM better.

Moderated by the Open Virtualization Alliance, this session will also explore how best to enable cutting-edge end users to network together and with the development community.
