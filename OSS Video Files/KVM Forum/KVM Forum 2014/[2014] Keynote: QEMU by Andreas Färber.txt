	00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,750
so good morning everyone let's get

00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,849
started my name is andreas baba i'm

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:17,539
going to give you an update on qm you

00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:20,800
this morning so first of all since last

00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:24,320
kvm forum we have had a major change of

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,360
the project and release management from

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,630
anthony liguori i haven't seen him this

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:34,129
morning yet please raise your hand if

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,989
you're there to peter medal and some

00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:40,160
assistance from my growth for the

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:43,699
release management we have had two major

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,890
releases already this year 20 and 21

00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:50,269
with a major version change from 17

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,449
mostly we're still backwards compatible

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:57,319
and we're about to release version 2

00:00:53,449 --> 00:01:00,769
door to pretty soon and Mike Roth has

00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:06,290
done an awesome work in releasing seven

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:08,950
stable releases so some applause for the

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,950
two of them please

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:20,180
we've also seen an initiative to put

00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,580
much more focus on security aspects of

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,090
qmu including some scenarios that we

00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,509
neglected in the past so Kimmy has not

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:31,070
gotten worse lately but we've simply

00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,200
closed a lot of holes that could arise

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,899
if you were actually not using TM you to

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,360
create for instance image files but if

00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:41,750
they were handcrafted or somehow

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:45,860
maliciously crafted and used with qmu we

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:49,009
have had in hole up to today 62 commits

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,259
mentioning CVE so as a number of the

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:55,490
security incidents involved being closed

00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:59,200
and we have started to formalize the

00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:02,810
process for disclosing security

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,240
vulnerabilities slightly further and

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,509
michael Esterkin has been taken on the

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:13,940
lead in these efforts also thanks to him

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:16,400
for that this year EMU has participated

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,250
both in google Summer of Code and in the

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,170
outreach program for women I will go

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:26,660
into details of those projects shortly

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:29,930
and if we compare the commit statistics

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,739
from last year to this year we're pretty

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,239
close and there is still well number of

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:38,890
months to go until the end of the year

00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,030
so there is no decline so it is

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,959
contributions are pretty much as strong

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,600
as before if not even growing still in

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:54,920
brackets is with merges and the actual

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:57,170
number is those counted out a number of

00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,030
major features have been added this list

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,000
is certainly not conclusive you can look

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,010
up the release notes of the two last

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,190
releases plus the upcoming one if you

00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:10,160
want to learn more about that among

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,510
others is we have a m2n threading

00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,600
support for vote on your block data

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:18,019
plane we got a user space implementation

00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,269
of V host on the block side we got a

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,560
corn driver as well as support for

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:26,610
fourcade block size disks

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,790
on the area of hot edge we got support

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,440
for memory hot-plug as well as PCI hot

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,750
plug in general as well as memory hot

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,690
plug for the q35 machine in addition to

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,090
the I 440 of X the Power Architecture

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,060
has gained support for little endian

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,400
both as far as vertigo and memory

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:51,000
damping and Linux user emulation goes

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,060
for the emulation parts of qmu we have

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,580
seen the 64-bit ARM ambulation support

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,049
completed with system instructions on

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,269
the one side and with cryptic

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,130
instructions on the other and for the

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,049
upcoming release we have seen a new

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:08,340
target of the infineon try core

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:11,090
architecture for the Linux distributions

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,959
of interest is that q mu has grown

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:17,940
support for modules which is essentially

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,419
not a plug-in mechanism but a way to

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,460
actually separate out parts of cambia

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,800
with external dependencies so that

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,490
someone installing tmb does not need to

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,620
install the full range of dependencies

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:35,550
for features that he or she might not

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,860
actually use and on the windows side the

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:43,740
gtk user front-end has actually been

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:47,430
enabled there as well now 2 g's awk

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,430
we've had for project three of them in

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,460
pmu of itself that is the v TD

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,910
ambulation by leighton mentored by yang

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,190
kiske we've had support for the cutest

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,169
framework in form of testing

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,260
infrastructure for vertigo and I to see

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:07,350
by Mark mahi who is actually present at

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:11,550
this conference although possibly not at

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:14,639
the moment then we have seen a project

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:20,230
on continuous vm state testing melted by

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:24,820
one and done by a sanity ha yeah sorry

00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:28,750
and outside of KM you for the use of qme

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:33,010
we've also had a project adding support

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:37,420
for the booty fi of mac OS x 2 t on oak

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:40,320
or so that mac OS x can be fully

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,880
emulated without any hacks in GM you

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:49,090
mentored by Alexa mcgough and the

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:50,740
project done by hayes i hear there for

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,540
the first time now we've also

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,240
participated in the genome outreach

00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,810
program for women we've had one project

00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,870
there by maria Kostova who is testing

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:08,080
the various disk image formats by using

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:14,410
fuzzing mentored by stefan anoche now to

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:16,570
the commit stats the numbers absolutely

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:20,200
all right still on the rise of

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:22,150
individual authors so we have seen a big

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,040
change on the top which is now Peter

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,040
maydel so hands please

00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:34,399
followed by Richard Henderson and

00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:37,499
palawan zeny and on the reviewer side

00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,749
there's not much change to last year

00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:45,989
eric blake is still on top which is

00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:47,879
still really amazing followed also by

00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:53,639
Richard Henderson and Mike left second

00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:58,249
and you can actually see that the top

00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:01,589
part is quite similar with many of the

00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:03,719
others actually participating in the

00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:05,579
reviews and one other thing that I would

00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:07,499
like to point out is that we're seeing

00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:08,849
quite an increase of the review that is

00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:13,189
actually happening within the block

00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:13,189
layer so many thanks for that as well

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:20,159
now as far as the maintenance go we've

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,439
seen a real surge of Peter doing a lot

00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:24,029
of committing since he transitioned to

00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,889
the role of the project maintainer

00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:27,389
picking up individual packages from the

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,749
list and doing a really amazing work

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:33,539
there followed by Stefan high note G and

00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:46,469
kevin wolff both mostly for the block

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:50,009
layer as well so applause and if we look

00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:52,110
at the company statistics I've also

00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,879
really am drawn the arrows to actually

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,909
compared to last year to see some trends

00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:01,469
there so red head is still absolutely at

00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:02,969
number one followed by linaro and if we

00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:05,279
look at just the company's then that

00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:07,079
would be IBM on third place but I also

00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,529
wanted to point out that we've really

00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,699
seen a large increase in actual

00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,349
contributions from people who were not

00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,749
to my knowledge associated with a

00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:18,029
certain company that was pondering these

00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:19,769
efforts so to some degree there was I've

00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:21,419
tried to count that out already with

00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:23,249
think there were two commits from

00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,079
someone working at Samsung using another

00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:27,389
email address but otherwise we're seeing

00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,579
a lot of individual contributions to key

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,709
mu still which is really important for

00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,050
keeping the project vital and I'm

00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:36,479
actually taking part taking care of some

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,949
of the areas that are not so relevant to

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,949
the big limit distributions

00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:45,700
one other trend that we can see here is

00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,170
that actually hardware companies are

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,930
playing an increasing role in

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,180
contributing to the kemah development in

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,630
addition to the Linux vendors that have

00:08:52,180 --> 00:09:01,960
been strong since quite a number of

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:08,650
years with pilings Huawei and one number

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:10,900
eleven that would be fujitsu if we look

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:15,400
further into the future what is there to

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:17,950
be done we've seen an enormous increase

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,510
in test coverage already one of them

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,040
through the gzip project but also

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,500
through individual maintained errs

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,620
trying to verify that certain commits

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,510
are not leading to regressions in the

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,850
code base but there's still a lot of

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,650
things to be done the infrastructure has

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,780
been amended by now what still needs to

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,580
be done now is actually to write and

00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,280
test for individual functions of

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:42,280
individual drivers and for maintainer to

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,920
actually be aware that they can actually

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,290
ask in many cases contributors to

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,840
actually supply test cases along with

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,730
both new devices or with fixes to

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:56,050
existing devices if test cases are

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:59,230
already present then on the big Anthony

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,640
topic the Kwan conversions is still not

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,320
quite complete there's still a lot of

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,410
things to be done even if there has

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,360
still been many areas already touched

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,110
and made more accessible to management

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,900
tools such as levert and also for

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,890
inspection for developers and paolo will

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:20,980
be holding a talk later today I believe

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:23,020
looking into what tomorrow sorry Mia

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,450
culpa so but yes there will be a

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,390
discussion of how this has actually

00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:31,650
worked out so far and how this is

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:34,720
supposed to continue in the future and

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:39,430
well I can only repeat some things that

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,470
Anthony has been bringing up here we are

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,420
always interested in finding and

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,450
integrating new contributors into our

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,720
processes and in particular there are

00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,720
