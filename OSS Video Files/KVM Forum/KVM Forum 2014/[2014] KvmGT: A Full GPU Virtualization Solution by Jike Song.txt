Description: 
	GPU virtualization is an enabling technology in emerging virtualization scenarios. Unfortunately, existing GPU virtualization approaches are still suboptimal in performance and full feature support. iGVT-g is a product level GPU virtualization implementation with: 1) full GPU virtualization running native graphics driver in guest, and 2) mediated pass-through that achieves both good performance and scalability, and also secure isolation among guests. In this session we will present our work to enable iGVT-g in KVM. With this work, multiple KVM guests could all run 3D workloads with close-to-native performance. It's observed that there will be remarkable improvement of graphics performance for KVM Guest.

Jike is working for Intel Corporation, focused on Graphics Virtualization - a full GPU virtualization solution Mediated Pass-Through. Previously this project was called XenGT, with only Xen hypervisor supported. Now it has a new name iGVT-g, and a KVM prototype, which will be referred as KvmGT, is fundamentally working.
