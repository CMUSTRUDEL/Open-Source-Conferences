Title: [2014] Validating and defending QEMU TCG targets by Alex Bennée

Description: 
	With ARMv8 silicon still scarce there is demand for a QEMU based solution to replace ARM's non-free Fast Models. We describe the challenges in providing such a port along with some novel techniques used to verify the implementation. We used a tool called RISU, which creates pseudo-random sequences of instructions which can be run in lock-step between a master and slave to verify emulation against a known good reference. We will discuss the limitations of the tool and analyse the bugs that were discovered after the initial patches were merged upstream. We will compare the results of code coverage analysis with the traditional black box testing used to validate system emulation. Finally we shall discuss how the testing could be better integrated into the project and how the lessons learnt could be applied to other architectures.

Alex is a senior software engineer working in Linaro's Virtualization team. An experienced FLOSS developer with over 20 years of experience in embedded and systems programming he currently spends most of his time on QEMU's TCG based emulation. The first piece of assembly he wrote was for the 6809 in his Dragon 32 followed by excessive pixel flinging on the 68000 before x86 took over the world.
