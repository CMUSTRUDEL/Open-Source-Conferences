Title: [2014] Deterministic Replay and Reverse Debugging for QEMU by P. Dovgalyuk

Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	We want to present our implementation of deterministic replay for QEMU. Deterministic replay can be used for replay and reverse debugging of guest code through a gdb remote interface. In this presentation we will review the challenges we faced while creating deterministic replay, the architecture of our solution to these problems, and applications of deterministic replay. Possible applications will include reverse debugging of the whole system including the kernel and user code.

I am a software developer in the Institute for System Programming (ISP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS). The activities of the Institute include fundamental research, software development, applied research for the benefits of the Industry, and education. For the last 4 years I have been working on the project whose aim is adding deterministic replay and reverse debugging to QEMU. I presented this work once in 2012 at the 16th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering.
