Title: [2014] KVM I O Performance and End-to-end Reliability by Nicholas A. Bellinger
Publication date: 2014-10-21
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	The discussion is around KVM disk I/O performance + latency using different approaches including vhost-scsi + in-kernel target, QEMU virtio-scsi, and virtio-blk/data-plane. This includes current developments for scsi-mq, and benefits that a blk-mq based I/O stack brings to the virtio-scsi LLD. It also covers remaining TODOs for supporting live migration in vhost-scsi code, and extra considerations with in-kernel LIO target state like SPC-3 persistent reservations and ALUA port access state across multiple nodes utilizing shared storage. Other topics include vhost-scsi support in Openstack, guest support for T10 Protection Information (PI), DIF metadata for application tagging of individual in-guest storage blocks, and different use cases for vhost-scsi vs. virtio-scsi dataplane + user-space iSCSI initiator.


Nicholas A. Bellinger, Datera
I'm the SCSI (LIO) target maintainer for the Linux kernel, and co-founder + CTO at Datera. I'm also the principle author of the upstream iscsi-target, iSCSI extentions for RDMA (iSER) target, qlogic 4/8/16 Fibre Channel target, and vhost-scsi drivers. My ongoing projects include vhost-scsi live migratation support in QEMU, the generational rewrite of the Linux/SCSI initiator subsystem (scsi-mq), and T10 Protection Information (DIF) support with virtio-scsi + vhost-scsii. I've presented at Linux Storage & Filesystem workshop in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2014, and LinuxCon North American in 2009.
