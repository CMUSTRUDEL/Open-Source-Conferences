Title: [2014] QOM Exegesis and Apocalypse by Paolo Bonzini
Publication date: 2014-10-29
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	The QEMU object model was first introduced into QEMU in 2011. The way it's been adopted since then, however, doesn't always match the originally planned shape of QOM. This talk will show how QOM integrates with other infrastructural components of QEMU (most notably QAPI), where and how QOM ended up being used, and propose ideas for its future evolution.


Paolo Bonzini, Red Hat
I've been working since 2009 on virtualization for Red Hat, where I am a Principal Software Engineer. My contributions have focused almost exclusively on QEMU and KVM since 2011, and since May 2013 I have been co-maintaining the KVM hypervisor. I've presented my work on QEMU at KVM Forum every year since 2011.
