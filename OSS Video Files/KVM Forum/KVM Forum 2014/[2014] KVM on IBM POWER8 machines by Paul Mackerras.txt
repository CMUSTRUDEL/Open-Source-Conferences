Title: [2014] KVM on IBM POWER8 machines by Paul Mackerras
Publication date: 2014-10-23
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	Recently IBM has started shipping POWER8-based servers with a KVM-based hypervisor. This hypervisor, IBM PowerKVM, is based on the work we have been doing for the last 4 years to make KVM run on IBM Power processors. Users can create and manage guests using the traditional virsh command line or via the Kimchi web interface, or can install OpenStack agents and manage the system using OpenStack. This talk will discuss the details of the IBM PowerKVM implementation, and look at the features and characteristics of the IBM POWER8 processor that relate to the task of making KVM run efficiently on the processor. This includes the new "micro-threading" mode which allows us to have up to 4 guests running simultaneously on a single core at any given point in time, but which introduces substantial implementation complexity in the architecture-specific KVM code to manage it.

Paul Mackerras works in IBM's Linux Technology Center. He has been contributing to the Linux kernel for 18 years, and was the PowerPC Linux maintainer for 7. For the last 4 years, he has been working on making KVM exploit the hardware virtualization features of IBM's Power microprocessors. He has previously spoken at many Linux-related conferences, including KVM Forum (2011, 2013), LCA (2006, 2010), and OLS (2000, 2003).
