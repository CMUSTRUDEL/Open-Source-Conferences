Publication date: 2014-10-27
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	The traditional way of configuring block devices in QEMU leaves a lot to be desired. Last year's presentation outlined its problems, what a better mechanism might look like and the first steps towards it. After a year, a lot of progress has been made, and at the same time new challenges have become apparent. We will present the current state of affairs, take a look at the next steps to be done and possibly also yet unsolved design challenges.
