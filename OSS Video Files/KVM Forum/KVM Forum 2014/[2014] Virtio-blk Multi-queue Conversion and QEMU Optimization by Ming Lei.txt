Title: [2014] Virtio-blk Multi-queue Conversion and QEMU Optimization by Ming Lei
Publication date: 2014-10-27
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	It is natural to map virtio-blk's virtqueue to blk-mq's hardware queue when blk-mq is ready in linux kernel now, then I/O request won't be blocked inside VM any more, but QEMU may be the next bottleneck of the whole I/O path. This presentation will introduce Ming Lei's in-progressing work on conversion to blk-mq of virtio-blk in both linux kernel and QEMU side, investigations why QEMU becomes new bottleneck, and proposed optimizations on QEMU to improve virtio-blk dataplane performance in case of multi virtqueue. These optimizations are based on model in which linux-aio may get best performance. Test result shows both throughput and scalability get lots of improvement about virtio-blk dataplane with both multi-queue conversion and QEMU optimizations.

Ming Lei, Canonical
My name is Ming Lei, and I am a experienced linux kernel developer, have contributions to Block IO, USB stack, PM and other kernel components. Recently days, I am especially interested in Block I/O, kernel AIO and Virtualization, and have contributions to QEMU too. I am a software engineer, and working at hyperscale team of Canonical from 2011, responsible for enabling and improving Ubuntu kernel especially in block I/O and virtualization for hypserscale server product. Previously speaking and presentations: - "Runtime Power Management for I/O devices" in China Linux kernel conference, 2011; "Using lockdep to find Ubuntu kernel bugs early" in Ubuntu platform Rally 2001
