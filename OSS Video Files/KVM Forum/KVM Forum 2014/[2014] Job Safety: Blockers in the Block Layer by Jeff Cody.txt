Title: [2014] Job Safety: Blockers in the Block Layer by Jeff Cody
Publication date: 2014-10-27
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	QEMU supports running multiple block jobs, issued via QMP, while the guest continues to operate live. Not all operations can safely run concurrently, however. There is some support currently in QEMU to block unsafe operations, but the support is incomplete, and does not cover all scenarios. There are some proposed modifications to fix the gaps, and to increase the granularity of the block job locking. This talk will cover the existing job blocker support in QEMU, as well as new proposed methods to enhance the current support.
