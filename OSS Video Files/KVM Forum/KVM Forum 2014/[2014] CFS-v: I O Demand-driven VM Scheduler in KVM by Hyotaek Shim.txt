Description: 
	Although virtualization technology allows a high degree of server consolidation to maximize the resource utilization, it results in performance interference between consolidated servers running on the same physical machine, where CPU-intensive VMs and I/O-intensive VMs often coexist. We have observed not only that computing-intensive VMs still interfere with co-running I/O-intensive VMs, but also that I/O performance rapidly drops when each VM performs a mixed workload of computing and I/O. To handle this problem, we develop an I/O demand-driven VM scheduler, which enables KVM to track the characteristics of VMâ€™s tasks and to preempt computing tasks in a VM for timely boosting I/O-intensive tasks in other VMs. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheduler highly improves the I/O performance of VMs, but causes negligible degradation in the computing performance.
