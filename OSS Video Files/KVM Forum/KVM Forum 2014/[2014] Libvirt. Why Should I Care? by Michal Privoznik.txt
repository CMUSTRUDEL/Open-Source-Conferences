Title: [2014] Libvirt. Why Should I Care? by Michal Privoznik
Publication date: 2014-10-29
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	QEMU is a beautiful part of the KVM virtualization stack. It runs quickly, scales beautifully and is portable. However, it has some limitations that libvirt covers up. Things that libvirt does on top of QEMU are shown. The talk will step the audience through the process of starting a new VM, where libvirt work is shown the best. Other areas like networking, cgroups, secrets and snapshots are covered, too. The aim is to show what an important role libvirt plays in the virtualization stack.
