Title: [2014] New to QEMU: A Developer's Guide to Contributing by Jeff Cody
Publication date: 2014-10-24
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	QEMU is a large, and active, open source software project, with many contributors. Some contributors have been involved in the community for a long time, while others are new to QEMU (and perhaps new to open source development, as well). For those 'newbies', it can be a daunting task to create properly formatted patches, interact with the community, and become a productive QEMU developer. This talk will focus on getting new potential QEMU developers through the hurdles of submitting their first patch, and what to expect afterwards.
