Title: [2014] KVM Security Improvements by Andrew Honig
Publication date: 2014-10-15
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	This talk will cover a project to create a safer mode for KVM. We first started with an analysis of the guest reachable attack surface and historic vulnerabilities. Many of the vulnerabilities have been found in code that could be moved into userspace without significant performance impact to modern guests. The goal of the project is to provide a more flexible userspace API to allow userspace to handle more types of requests, while still leaving performance critical code in the kernel.
