Title: [2014] VFIO on sPAPR POWER by Alexey Kardashevskiy
Publication date: 2014-10-23
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	VFIO is a virtual fabric IO mechanism which provides access for the userspace to real devices (now PCI only). One of possible uses is passing PCI devices to guests via virtualization software such as QEMU. In this presentation, Alexey will talk about differences between different IOMMU models, challenges it causes on POWERPC which include architecture differences, performance issues and interaction with KVM. Alexey is going to discuss with the community what could have been done different or better.in
