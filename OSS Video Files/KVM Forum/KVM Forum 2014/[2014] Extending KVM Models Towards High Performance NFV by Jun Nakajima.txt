Title: [2014] Extending KVM Models Towards High Performance NFV by Jun Nakajima
Publication date: 2014-10-20
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	As we have more demanding requirements for NFV (Network Functions Virtualization), such as handling smaller packets at very high rate in a scalable fashion, efficient and fast network-packets handling in middle boxes are critical. The architecture and performance of the virtualization I/O technologies, such as virtio rings, shared memory, and SR-IOV, can be improved by having a trusted entity that understands solution-specific data structures and that has access to guest memory. By trusting part of the guest and providing it with a memory view protected from the rest of the guest, we have extended the KVM models. We present 1) overview of the EPTP switching feature, 2) how we can provide protected memory views to trusted components in guests, 3) how we can improve and extend the current KVM models toward NFV combined with SR-IOV, and 4) best practices.
