Title: [2014] VFIO, OVMF, GPU and You by Alex Williamson
Publication date: 2014-10-29
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	Last year we introduced VFIO-VGA support, opening up virtual machines to be used as gaming platforms and high performance visual workstations. While many users have had success with this, we continue to struggle with the fragile nature of VGA routing and arbitration of this shared resource between host devices. In this talk we'll discuss some of these issues and present an alternative, legacy-free approach that avoids the VGA address space.
