Title: [2014] Thanks for Live Snapshots, Where's Live Merge? by Adam Litke
Publication date: 2014-10-29
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	oVirt has supported the ability to take live snapshots of a VM since version 3.2 but these snapshots could only be deleted or merged when the VM is powered off. On the surface this seems like a small incongruity that should be easily fixed but it has taken us three major releases to deliver live merge capabilities. This talk will demonstrate how each component in the KVM stack works together to seemlessly merge a snapshot and how oVirt ensures reliability and data integrity when facing storage connectivity issues and other unexpected events. Next, we will cover how live merge improves other oVirt features such as VM Backup and Live Storage Migration. Finally, a discussion of new ideas and future improvements will be presented.
