Title: [2014] Migration: Trying to Make it More Robust by Juan Quintela

Description: 
	Migration on KVM is known to be a fragile beast. Changing anything has caused migration to break. A bigger problem was that we never detected that anything was broken until it was too late (i.e. after doing a release). During this year there have been several changes to improve this:

- continuous VMState / live-migration metadata testing: this allows us to check--at run-time--that we can load a device state at any single moment (GSoC project)

- migration format checker: analyze fields for each device to verify that migration will not fail before it is even attempted (Amit)

- size array checks all over the tree (mst)

- VMState / live-migration metadata tests (static checker): We have written a tool that verifies compatibility with every component in the VMState / live-migration metadata. This makes it much easier for developers to make changes at the core, because checking if the format has become incompatible (for migration) or not is just a simple run of the static checker.

Juan was born in Galicia, Spain. He started working on his PhD in Computing Science (Functional Programming), but after 3 years Linux kernel programming lured him. Juan has Worked at Mandriva as the Kernel Maintainer from 2000 to 2005. In 2005 he joined the Virtualization Team at Red Hat. Currently he is working on the KVM hypervisor where he handles migration issues with VMState, enhances the build and configuration system, and other random bits. He teaches Operating Systems at Universidade da Coru√±a, part-time, where he still maintains hope to someday finish his PhD.
