Publication date: 2014-10-27
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	The OpenStack project builds and distributes the leading open source cloud infrastructure platform. Of all the hypervisors supported, KVM is by far the most widely deployed in production, by an order of magnitude. In the most recent dev cycles there has been a big uptake in interest in optimizing hardware performance. To that end there is work being done to enable full advantage to be had from NUMA hardware, huge pages and CPU affinity. This talk will look at the work undertaken and the unique challenges faced in a cloud environment, as opposed to traditional data center virtualization.
