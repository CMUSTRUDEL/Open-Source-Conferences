Title: [2014] Optimizing I O Virtualization and VM Memory Management for Tablet Devices by Bodeuk Jeong
Publication date: 2014-10-23
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	In this talk, we present our production-level optimization effort in both Android and QEMU/KVM for bringing out the virtualization tech to tablet devices. There are two key requirements for running Windows as an Android app: 1.To achieve good performance in terms of user perception; Starting up a Windows VM and switching from and to other apps should be done in a short period of time. Human interactive IO devices should be in no delay. 2.To seamlessly interface QEMU with Android framework. We develop automatic ballooning with low memory killer and activity manager. We also implement virtual IO devices such as multi-touch, audio w/ openSL, bluetooth w/ Bluedroid, etc. In addition, we optimize VM snapshot loader by modifying qcow2 and utilizing transparent huge pages. As a result, VM boot-time is reduced by 90% and VM performance is not compromised with IO delay on a recent Atom tablet.
