Description: 
	QEMU as any other software project needs tools for continuous checking and testing to avoid inserting bugs in already working code. This need is increased by its active development and frequent releases. Due to its high number and heterogeneity, emulated devices and supported drivers are especially important to test and check every new build. To simplify the development of this tests to the device developers, a simple but really powerful testing suite framework, called qtest, has been added to QEMU in the last years. In this presentation, Marc Marí will show how to develop tests for devices in QEMU, what drivers are available at the moment, how to debug the tests and how to share it with the community.
