Title: [2014] KVM on MIPS by James Hogan
Publication date: 2014-10-22
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	The MIPS architecture is used across the spectrum from heavyweight networking gear down to wearables and embedded/IoT devices, which makes virtualization important on MIPS both for traditional use on servers and also for security on consumer hardware. In this presentation, James Hogan will look at the different approaches to virtualizing the MIPS architecture with and without hardware assistance, and will delve into some of the technical considerations involved in virtualizing MIPS with KVM.


James Hogan, Imagination Technologies
James Hogan works in the MIPS processor division of Imagination Technologies. Prior to Imagination's acquisition of MIPS in 2013 he worked on a port of Linux to Imagination's Meta processor architecture, including upstreaming and now maintaining it, and also implemented a QEMU frontend for the Meta architecture for fun. He now works primarily on improving MIPS KVM support, which has involved bringing up the MIPS VZ hardware assisted virtualization extension on new cores, upstreaming the basic QEMU support for MIPS KVM, and now working to unify and eventually upstream KVM support for MIPS VZ.
