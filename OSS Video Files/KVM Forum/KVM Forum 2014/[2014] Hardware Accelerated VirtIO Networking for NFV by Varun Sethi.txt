Description: 
	Network function virtualization (NFV) leverage's virtualization to consolidate multiple network functions on to a standard platform.The network functions are decoupled from hardware, allowing them to run in software as virtual machines. Network I/O with in these virtual machine needs to be both fast and flexible. Virtio networking offers a flexible mechanism for sharing I/O interface among virtual machines. Despite the flexibility, there are performance challenges with virtio/ vhost-net for virtual network functions. For high traffic rates efficient packet classification and distribution is required with virtio for VMs. This can be achieved using hardware offloads. In this presentation we discuss the performance issues encountered and how these were mitigated with hardware offloads while running IP forwarding as a virtual network function under KVM hypervisor with Vhost-net networking.

Varun Sethi is a Software Architect at Freescale Semiconductor and has been involved in virtualization software development for embedded Power Architecture SOCs. He has contributed to the KVM port for BookE.HV platforms and the e500mc core. He is the maintainer for Freescale PAMU (IOMMU) driver. He's working on enhancements for the ARM SMMU driver to support Freescale Layerscape platforms. Varun is also looking at Virtio performance analysis and optimizations. Varun has made presentations on KVM hypervisor at FTF and KVM Forum (2012). He has also conducted talks, on dependability in case of virtualized platforms at the IEEE DSN conference. He has a joint publication on KVM optimizations for BookE platforms without hardware virtualization assists, at ASPLOS 2013. He has conducted a joint talk on network virtualization at the Linux foundation collaboration summit held in 2013.
