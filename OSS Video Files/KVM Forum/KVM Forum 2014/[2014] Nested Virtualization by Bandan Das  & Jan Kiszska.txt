Title: [2014] Nested Virtualization by Bandan Das  & Jan Kiszska
Publication date: 2014-10-27
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	Nested Virtualization was once considered as a research project, but we are seeing real demands for it, even in the cloud. Without nested virtualization, hardware virtualization is not enabled in the cloud. As Linux is required to run in virtualization as the default deployment for IT and the cloud, the virtualization feature such as KVM or Xen is required to be available and optimized in guests as well. . In this talk, we discuss use cases, characteristics of nested virtualization, and optimizations using new hardware virtualization features, such as “VMCS shadowing”. Also, we will provide some performance data and discuss the current performance bottle neck, the challenges it faces and look forward to how the nested virtualization to address those challenges.
