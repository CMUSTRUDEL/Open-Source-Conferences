Title: [2014] KVM Platform Device Passthrough by Eric Auger
Publication date: 2014-10-16
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	Name in schedule: ARM KVM Platform Device Assignment

The VFIO platform driver enables user-side accesses to platform device (non-PCI) resources. We leverage this work in a new QEMU VFIO platform device. A key challenge is poor IRQ performance. It turns out that porting on ARM existing legacy PCI frameworks based on eventfds, kvm irqfds and VFIO virqfds is not sufficient to reach near-native performance. To reach best performance, we propose to enable ARM GIC features that were not yet enabled in the kernel: dual stage priority drop and direct physical IRQ completion. Integrating these features bring challenges that require us to re-consider both the usage model and implementation of the VFIO platform driver and IRQFD framework. We will present the various IRQ assignment techniques and provide performance numbers based on Calxeda Midway xgmac assignment. We will discuss the implementation and integration options.


Eric Auger, Linaro
Eric is an STMicroelectronics Linaro assignee, working in the virtualization team since Feb 2014. His work focuses on KVM platform device passthrough. He has previously worked at STMicroelectronics/STEricsson in various positions, latterly as a system architect assigned to iommu introduction and dimensioning, IP HW virtualization and related SW frameworks. In older ages, Eric was multimedia SW architect on ST/STEricsson Nomadik/NovaThor SOC families featuring Symbian and Android (2005-2012), multimedia driver tester, SW developer and tech lead in HW/SW co-verification techniques and SOC modeling area.
