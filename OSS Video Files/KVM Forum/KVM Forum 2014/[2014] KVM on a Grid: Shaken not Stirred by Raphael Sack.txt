Description: 
	Let’s say you have 10,000 Linux servers. Now, let’s say you need to upgrade these servers to version+1. How long is this effort going to take? Now consider the following scenario: All these servers are running 24/7 business critical tasks. Any disruption will cause significant delays in project timetables, and incur financial costs. How long would it take you to upgrade these servers now? You may decide the entire operation is unfeasible. KVM on grid is a flexible, fast solution enabling dynamic management and allocation of virtual machines in large scale high-performance environments. It revolves around state of the art open-source virtualization, combined with distributed computing models. This allows near-real time deployment of systems on a mass scale, minimizing the overhead and complexity of the environment. It’s not cloud, it’s not batch, it’s “KVM on grid”!
