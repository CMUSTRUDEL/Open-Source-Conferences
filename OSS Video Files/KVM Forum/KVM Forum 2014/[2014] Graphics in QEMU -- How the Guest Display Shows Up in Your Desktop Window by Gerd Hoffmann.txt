Title: [2014] Graphics in QEMU -- How the Guest Display Shows Up in Your Desktop Window by Gerd Hoffmann
Publication date: 2014-10-29
Playlist: KVM Forum 2014
Description: 
	This talk describes the graphics workflow in QEMU. This workflow is responsible for making the pixels the guest VM places into the Cirrus VGA memory appear in your GTK window or VNC client. We'll have a sneak preview into the future with upcoming OpenGL support and virtio-gpu emulation, bringing accelerated 3D-graphics to QEMU. Recent changes such as multiseat support--added to QEMU 2.1--will be covered too.
