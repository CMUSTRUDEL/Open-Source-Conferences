Paolo Bonzini,Red Hat

I've been working since 2009 on virtualization for Red Hat, where I am a Principal Software Engineer. My contributions have focused almost exclusively on QEMU and KVM since 2011, and since May 2013 I have been co-maintaining the KVM hypervisor. I've presented my work on QEMU at KVM Forum every year since 2011.
