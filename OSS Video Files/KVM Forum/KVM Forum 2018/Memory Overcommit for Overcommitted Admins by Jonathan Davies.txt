Title: Memory Overcommit for Overcommitted Admins by Jonathan Davies
Publication date: 2018-11-14
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	Overcommitting memory is a useful tool for increasing VM density but typically comes with a increased administration cost as either a) "safe" memory limits need to configured for each VM; or b) unexpected performance problems need to be identified and addressed.

An automatic and lightweight method for determining a VMs working set is described with suggestions on how this could be used in clustered and non-clustered environments to increase VM density with less of an administrative burden.

The presentation also includes a look at the simple model of Linux's paging subsystem that was used to rapidly prototype and evaluate the method's behaviour with different workloads.
