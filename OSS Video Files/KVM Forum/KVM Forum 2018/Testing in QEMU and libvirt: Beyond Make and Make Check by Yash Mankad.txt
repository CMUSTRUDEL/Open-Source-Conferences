Title: Testing in QEMU and libvirt: Beyond Make and Make Check by Yash Mankad
Publication date: 2018-11-17
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	Automated testing in the QEMU and libvirt communities is largely focused on running unit tests on various environments using the `make check` command, but has never developed beyond that into a centralized continuous integration environment. In this session, Yash Mankad will give an overview on the initiative undertaken by the Virtualization group at Red Hat to look beyond `make check`, by leveraging Ansible and the Avocado testing framework to expand automated test coverage executing across multiple architectures, operating systems, and testing environments. Yash will also share his ideas on integrating testing initiatives already in place, like patchew and travis CI, with this common platform. This initiative will result in QEMU and libvirt developers gaining three times the platform coverage while providing a central point for continuous integration for the QEMU and libvirt projects.
