Title: Distributed QEMU by Yubin Chen & Zhuocheng Ding

Description: 
	It is difficult for a single physical machine to satisfy applications which require massive resources such as big data analysis, while a virtual machine spanning multiple physical nodes can do it. In this presentation, Yubin will demonstrate their work of distributed QEMU which allows a guest OS running on single virtual machine to take advantage of resources (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.) from multiple physical nodes. They extend QEMU to enable forwarding of PIO, MMIO, Interrupts so that vCPUs and I/O devices on different machines can communicate with each other. Furthermore, in order to run a cross-node virtual machine, they also have implemented an RDMA-based distributed shared memory by extending the access control of EPT, which makes it possible for aggregating physical memory transparently. The preliminary experiment shows near-native performance for NUMA-friendly benchmarks on sv6 OS.
