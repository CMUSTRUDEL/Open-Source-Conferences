Description: 
	Pre-copy migration could fail for many cases, e.g, if there are memory intensive workloads in VM. Fortunately, QEMU/KVM gains some features to improve it, however these features require the user need to pre-know the workloads in VM, e.g, enable compression only if the data is compressible and system has enough resource to do compression that is not friendly to the public cloud providers. Post-copy migration improves the situations indeed, however, it suffers some shortcomings, e.g, it is unrecoverable, poor performance, etc.

We will present adaptive live migration which speculates VM's workload from host side then enables pre-copy features and adjusts its parameters dynamically, during live migration, it detects the tendency and try next feature if current tendency shows live migration is impossible to success. Try post-copy if we have used all ways but pre-copy still can not success.
