	Full talk name: Kata Containers: Leveraging Advanced Features of QEMU to Provide Better Container Isolation

Kata Containers is an open source project that brings the security of hardware virtualization to containers through lightweight VMs. In its effort to look and feel like a container, Kata leverages many of the features in KVM/QEMU which are typically not needed for a cloud virtual machine.

How many developers use VFIO? How many use VFIO-hotplug? And DAX and nvdimm and CPU hotplug?

This session details how Kata Containers use features of KVM/QEMU and some of the problem areas we encountered along the way. Finally, we discuss areas in the hypervisor we’re looking to focus on going forward.
