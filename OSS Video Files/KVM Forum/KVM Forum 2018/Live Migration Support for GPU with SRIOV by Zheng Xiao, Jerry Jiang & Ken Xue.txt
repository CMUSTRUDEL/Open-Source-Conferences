Description: 
	Full name: Live Migration Support for GPU with SRIOV: Challenges and Solution

As we all known pass-through device is not migration-friendly because of hypervisor hard to track device hardware's internal status. While there are still chance for specific device to support live migration: for example AMD GPU devices. AMD GPU product with SRIOV virtualization already deployed in alibaba cloud to support graphic remote rendering. Right now there are increasing demands from customers to support migration of vGPU. In this session, alibaba engineers will introduce a generic solution in VFIO how to migrate GPU device within VFIO framework, expose what's challenges we have. while AMD engineers will expose details what need to do inside SRIOV PF device driver to overcome these challenges. Last, there will be a short demo video how it looks like for audiences.
