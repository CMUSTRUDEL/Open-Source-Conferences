Publication date: 2018-11-17
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	vdpa is introduced to vhost so as to hookup with a virtio compatible DMA controller. It allows whatever HW device being represented as emulated virtio device being able to DMA buffers to guest directly.
vhost-mdev constructs a new transport carrying vhost protocol message, which leverages mdev framework to expose virtio compatible portion from its parent device. Qemu vhost takes vhost-mdev instances as general VFIO devices.
The talk is going to introduce all building blocks including qemu vhost-vfio adapter, kernel vhost-mdev helpers and a driver provider. Meanwhile, it will touch some points relevant to the new feature bits in virtio spec.
