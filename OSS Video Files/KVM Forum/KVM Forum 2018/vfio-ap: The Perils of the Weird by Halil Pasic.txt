Title: vfio-ap: The Perils of the Weird by Halil Pasic

Description: 
	Pass-through of AP crypto adapters is an ongoing effort spanning KVM, QEMU, and Libvirt. Patches are under discussion. The problem at hand is unique due to the properties of the virtualization facilities provided by the platform. We use vfio-mdev to partition not a single device, but a set of devices. Another peculiarity is that individual cards can be partitioned, but not individually. The cards are partitioned into domains, which are independent from a functional perspective, but span all cards from an access-control perspective.

We have a family of drivers for the different card types on the ap bus. From a pass-through perspective these cards can be treated uniformly, so we ended up adding another driver to the ap bus. Consequently, we had to resolve a set of unique problems, such as how to bind the resources to the right driver and how to react when resources are unbound.
