Title: Background Snapshots - Denis Plotnikov

Description: 
	The VM snapshot is a widely-used feature to save a VM state. Currently, when you make a snapshot you are forced to pause your virtual machine until the snapshot is done. This is undesirable behavior because it's seen for the user as a temporary VM shutdown which is something you don't want when your goal is to provide your end-users with good quality of service.
I would like to introduce background snapshots: the feature allowing not to pause your virtual machine when making a VM snapshot. It keeps your virtual machine up and running until the end of the snapshotting process. I would like to explain some technical details on how we have achieved that and very short overview on how to use the feature.
