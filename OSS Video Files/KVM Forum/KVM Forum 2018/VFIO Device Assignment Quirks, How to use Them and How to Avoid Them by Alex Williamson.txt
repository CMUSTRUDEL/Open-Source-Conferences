Publication date: 2018-11-17
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	In order to assign a peripheral I/O device to a virtual machine, the device needs to be isolated from the host and aspects of the hardware need to be virtualized for transparency to the guest. Some devices and platforms are better at this than others. Nonobservance to specifications and creative backdoors through hardware can present challenges to device assignment. In this presentation, Alex Williamson will look at some of the common mistakes found in hardware that make device assignment more challenging, how we work around those challenges, and how devices and platforms can better enable device assignment.
