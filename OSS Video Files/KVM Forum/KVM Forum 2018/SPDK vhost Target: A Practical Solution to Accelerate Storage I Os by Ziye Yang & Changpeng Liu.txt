Description: 
	Full name: SPDK vhost Target: A Practical Solution to Accelerate Storage I/Os Inside VMs

In this presentation, we would like to introduce SPDK’s user space vhost* solution (including vhost-scsi/blk/NVMe), which can collaborate with QEMU & KVM to accelerate virtio-scsi, virtio-blk and even emulated NVMe controller inside guest OS. Relying on SPDK vhost* solution, the performance of I/Os inside VMs can be greatly improved compared (e.g., with I/O IOPS increasing, I/O latency decreasing) compared with the existing solutions (e.g., original QEMU emulation solution, kernel vhost* solution). Moreover, we compare our SPDK vhost-scsi/blk/NVMe with other approaches like other solutions (e.g., direct device pass-through solution, SR-IOV solution, Zheng’s VFIO based solution in KVM 2017, FPGA acceleration solution, etc). Generally, our solution is much more scalable and practical. Currently, SPDK vhost* solution is adopted by many cloud service providers (e.g., Alibaba).
