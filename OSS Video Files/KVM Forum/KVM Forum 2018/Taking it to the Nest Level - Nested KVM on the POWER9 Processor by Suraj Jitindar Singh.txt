Title: Taking it to the Nest Level - Nested KVM on the POWER9 Processor by Suraj Jitindar Singh
Publication date: 2018-11-14
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	Nested virtualisation refers to the idea of running a virtual machine within another virtual machine. The new IBM POWER9 PowerPC processor has increased hardware support for nested virtualisation and Suraj has been in the process of developing software support for this feature. In this talk he will delve into the rational behind developing this, the implementation details including the changes involved to KVM and qemu to support this feature, the challenges faced, and finally a discussion about the current state of the project and future work still to be completed. Suraj will also attempt to answer the question on everybody's lips "but how deep can you nest?"
