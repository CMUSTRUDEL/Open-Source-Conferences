Title: Hardware-Assisted Mediated Pass-Through with VFIO by Kevin Tian
Publication date: 2018-11-17
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	Hardware-assisted I/O virtualization techniques (e.g. PCI Express® SR-IOV) have limitations on enabling hyper-scale usages, dynamic resource management and software composability, etc. While bringing improvements in those areas, mediated pass-through techniques (e.g. VFIO mediated device) suffer from software complexity and inefficiency problems, due to lacking of finer-grained hardware assistance for guaranteed efficiency and protection. 
In this talk, Kevin Tian will introduce necessary architecture changes to enable finer-grained hardware assistance for mediated pass-through I/O virtualization, with Intel® Scalable I/O Virtualization technology as the example. A deep dive will be provided for key software framework changes, including design considerations spanning multiple components (VFIO, IOMMU, Qemu, etc.). Last is an overview of current enabling status and remaining opens.
