Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	Due to the history of the s390 architecture, many ways of memory management have been introduced to the platform over the years and are still available today. Numerous optimizations for guests increased speed and efficiency, but also added to the complexity that KVM now has to handle when running a guest. 

This talk will give an introduction on how KVM memory management for guests is handled on s390, how the optimizations work and what makes adding huge page backing support difficult.
