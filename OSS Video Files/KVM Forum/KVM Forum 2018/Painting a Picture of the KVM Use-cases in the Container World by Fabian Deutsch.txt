Title: Painting a Picture of the KVM Use-cases in the Container World by Fabian Deutsch
Publication date: 2018-11-14
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	KVM is a hypervisor offering strong hardware isolation of a guest from it's hosts.

Containers are now a new software based isolation mechanism for workloads, and it might be a small surprise to see that KVM is surfacing in this context quite often.

In this talk we'll look at how KVM is used on the containers and Kubernetes context.
Specifically we'll be looking at the projects KubeVirt, Katacontainers, gVisor, and virtlet, to understand how KVM is used by them to support certain use-cases.
