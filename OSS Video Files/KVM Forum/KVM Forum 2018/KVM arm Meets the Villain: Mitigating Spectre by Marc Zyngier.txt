Title: KVM arm Meets the Villain: Mitigating Spectre by Marc Zyngier
Publication date: 2018-11-17
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	The recent discovery of the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities has been an unfortunate disruption in the otherwise rapid pace of KVM/arm development. Significant efforts have been put into analysing how CPU implementations are affected, and in developing a mitigation framework that covers both KVM and VMs by allowing VMs to call hypervisor services to mitigate the vulnerabilities in the virtual machine.

This talk will briefly explain how the vulnerabilities affect ARM
systems and describe the range of techniques introduced in KVM/arm to mitigate Spectre v2, v3, v3a and v4. We will explain how our mitigation framework hides as much of the diversity of CPU implementations and system integration while trying to keep the overhead as low as possible.

Marc has been working on the Linux kernel since an unexpected encounter with 0.99pl13 in 1993. His first contribution was merged in 1996 in the form of the original version of the MD driver.

Having played with fault tolerant systems at Bull, worked on exotic (and ultimately doomed) CPU architectures at Texas Instruments, and had fun with consumer electronics at TomTom, he has been with ARM since 2010, where he focusses on the Linux kernel, co-maintaining KVM/arm and some parts of the IRQ subsystem. He is also involved in some new aspects of the ARM architecture.

He has presented a number of talks at Linux Plumbers, ELC, and KVM Forum over the past years.
