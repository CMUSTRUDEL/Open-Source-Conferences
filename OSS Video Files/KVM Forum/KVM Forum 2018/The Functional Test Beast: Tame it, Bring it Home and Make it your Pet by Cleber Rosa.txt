Title: The Functional Test Beast: Tame it, Bring it Home and Make it your Pet by Cleber Rosa

Description: 
	Functional tests have traditionally been kept outside. These poor beasts get beaten by heavy work, but are not allowed to sit in the couch by your side, nor are they given the freedom to run inside your $HOME.

There have been valid reasons for this separation, but what if a far more comprehensive (yet safe and manageable) functional testing environment could be added to the regular developer's work-flow, pretty much for free?

In this talk we'll present QEMU's brand new functional testing architecture and how it lets developers easily write and run advanced functional tests.

Because anything functional demands to be practical, we'll write a test for a real QEMU bug and its fix, running it in different targets and configurations from the very same development tree. Finally, we'll give the test a definitive home alongside that fix, while putting the bug on a permanent tight leash.
