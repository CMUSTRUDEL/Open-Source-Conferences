Title: L1TF and KVM by Alexander Graf
Publication date: 2018-10-31
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	Recently a new speculative execution side channel was unvealed, which
could potentially result in leakage of arbitrary memory contents into
unprivileged virtual machines on most recent Intel CPUs. This
presentation will give insights as to what the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF)
Spectre vulnerability is. It will show how it can be exploited and based
on that knowledge it will take a look at how KVM mitigates those
issues. It will also show performance penalties these mitigations incur.

On top of that, the presentation will present an alternative work in
progress approach to mitigate L1TF that may recover some of the
performance penalties by leveraging unrelated CPU features.

Principal Software Engineer

Alexander started working for SUSE about 10 years ago. Since then he worked on fancy things like SUSE Studio, QEMU, KVM, openSUSE and SLES on ARM and U-Boot. Whenever something really useful comes to his mind, he tends to implement it. Among others he did Mac OS X virtualization using KVM, nested SVM, KVM on PowerPC, a lot of work in QEMU for openSUSE on ARM and the UEFI compatibility layer in U-Boot.
