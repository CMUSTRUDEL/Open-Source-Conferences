Title: Getting Some Peace and Quiet as an Open Source Maintainer by Cornelia Huck
Publication date: 2018-11-14
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	So you came for the glory of being listed as a maintainer, only to discover that work is continuing to pile up, random people are bothering you on mailing lists, and users are asking for help to actually use your code?

Fear not, this talk is here to help. It will explore some strategies for handling contributions and discussions that leave you breathing space while still encouraging people to do more good work. After all, a burned out maintainer is bad news for everyone.

00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:14,070
welcome to my talk as the UK VM form was

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:21,480
as you accept read about maintainer ship

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:22,590
issues I apologize for our technical my

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,630
name is Cornelia

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:32,420
I'm a developer vetted in the

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:37,160
virtualization team I will talk about

00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:39,660
various topics let's talk just in

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,960
including defining what my vision of

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,489
what a maintainer sadducees rule is

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,530
everything I'm going from the easy stuff

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,610
which is technical stuff to the more

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:55,550
squishy you factors and the probably the

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,550
house one is just keeping save yourself

00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:01,859
so let's start just basically Who am I

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,430
I've already told you I've been working

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,400
in overtime virtualization team I have

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,500
been working with Linux and if GM you

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,369
for quite a long time especially with

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,180
Linux I'm mostly active in the mainframe

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:22,340
area since my as part a little bit so

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,740
they're small turd maintainer for Linux

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,640
that was kvms p90 and what I was really

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,760
done life started doing

00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:35,530
twelve general days later it was also be

00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:40,770
with Roc CW and contributor I've been

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:43,750
doing Linux stuff for quite some years

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:48,280
as you can see that is the freaking and

00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:50,140
PPP per area and mu I've started out of

00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,290
Atlanta it's only when I got finally

00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,820
start of the virtualization so what I

00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:57,400
have was both of perspective as a

00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,280
maintainer what I'm doing I'm acting as

00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,440
maintainer and it's the perspective when

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm interacting with our maintenance and

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:09,220
I want somebody to merge my code for

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:12,670
example so they having that that I

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,800
wanted to present it not only for people

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,320
who actually maintain some stuff but

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,459
also for people who just attacked with

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:24,340
maintainers and so maybe want to know

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:27,760
what does a maintainer do why are they

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,580
sometimes so strange by their sometimes

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,980
not very strange but just like everybody

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,310
else and so on and of course disclaimer

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,810
in my travel memory everybody has

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,780
different perspective on things

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:44,350
everybody works with different objects

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,180
and if you are not doing MINIX or qmu

00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:53,049
you may have a whole different

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:56,640
experience obviously so what in my

00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:59,590
perspective doesn't maintain actually do

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,739
basically maintainer is somebody who was

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:07,540
responsible for project piece of a

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:10,090
portrait some technical parts and they

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,330
give a bear sings one thing is of course

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:18,310
and then comes from maintenance you have

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:20,950
stuff you have the usual things

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,330
ecosystems involve you need to adapt you

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,100
need to make sure that keeps in good

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,170
place there are parts that I've found

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,380
you making need to make sure that fact

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,959
fixes are developed but you also need to

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,010
keep up for example about the changes

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,640
and stuff like that

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,050
or with a depending on what area of code

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,970
you

00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,319
so that's a really bad part basically

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,780
keeping going

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,680
not a big part as I was able to get

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:51,709
gatekeeper you you obviously want other

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,959
people to be able to merge things into

00:03:51,709 --> 00:04:00,170
your code part two but fixes but also

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,599
enhancements and things making things

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,840
nicer and so on but you also have to

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,360
look sometimes it's not quite what is

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,489
good for the project so it keeping and

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,150
saying okay this is not quite what I

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:13,610
want

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:19,699
please don't do it do it differently and

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:21,829
so on and as I've said coming from

00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:23,630
hardware and equals are some changes you

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,840
also need to coordinate with a lot of

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,750
our people for example if I'm doing a mu

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,680
work I have an upstream consumer that's

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,840
one upstate consumer for example advert

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,460
so I need obviously to coordinator of

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,650
Libertyville open school that they

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,410
actually have some these interfaces to

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,380
consume and on the other hand I for

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:48,919
example these two interactive kernel

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:52,520
developers so I'm using same interfaces

00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:56,180
and needs it will work together and

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,220
another of another piece of people you

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,080
want to interact of course your users

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,660
because if you just want software and

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,150
nobody is using it that's not really

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,289
sensible other than a hobby project for

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:12,190
example but if if you're if you use

00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:15,849
yourself requirements or ideas you

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:18,440
probably want to listen to them and

00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:21,200
another part is also sharing information

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,200
just about what you are doing for

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:29,240
example white blocks talking about

00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,770
things at conferences now even if I'm

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,160
not talking about technical stuff today

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:36,830
but that's really gets the word out you

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,099
get perhaps more users more developers

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,760
and maybe people will come to you and

00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,430
also give

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,230
some ideas what you can do better and

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:52,430
what is not working not survive and so

00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:54,800
on and there's of course not a man and

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:59,390
maintainer is not responsible for every

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,150
little thing for example when bugs are

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:06,130
there it is not your own responsibility

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:08,690
to fix it there if somebody breaks it is

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,060
first a responsibility of the people who

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,670
broke things to fix them of course you

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,190
should help if it's easy fix just do it

00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,320
but you'll be depth and in your

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,670
narrative and we work pretty soon a few

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,890
fixed element

00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:25,250
everybody's must and the same thing

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:28,270
which and also cost you a lot of time is

00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,860
if we're doing hand holding some people

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,380
seem to expect that you guide them at

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,020
long evidence of them that's not what

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,970
it's not the case if you have some

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,860
newbies coming in and you have to bring

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,590
them up to speed and mentor that with it

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,080
that's of course all quite stuff and you

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:48,170
should do that especially because it

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,030
brings new problem but some people just

00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,700
never seem to progress past that stage

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,710
and these are early times things so I

00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:59,090
don't think that's something entertainer

00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:01,580
to do and more and most importantly

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,350
other people are other people you can't

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,310
really control what they are doing you

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:09,590
can deal with it you can make allowances

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,210
for other people and you can push back

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,020
if they are doing bad things but you

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,020
can't control them

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,920
so now to the more easy stuff the

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:25,290
technical stuff it might not be playing

00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:27,000
it takes a long one important to thing I

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,620
found when I started out as maintainer

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,260
is that you need to find your own

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:36,690
workflow say that looks a few for you

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:38,820
Network for the project the everybody

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,520
has some different reference some people

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,500
really like detail planning and follow

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,240
their plans on what and that works very

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,140
well for them I'm not one of those

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,669
people I like to be more flexible and if

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,890
something interesting or something new

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:58,020
comes along I like to be able to switch

00:07:52,890 --> 00:08:00,870
and you know and it also of course

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,030
depends on your on your project you have

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,950
sometimes highly dynamic projects there

00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:08,760
are lots of new people of new ideas are

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:11,340
coming in and you end something that was

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,440
fully in the wage three months ago is

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,600
now completely outdated and something

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,160
like that and that is of course a

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,870
completely different environmental

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,320
working if you have something more

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:24,600
conservative the few people contributing

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,460
and you basically know where you will be

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,280
going in the next three years it's just

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,010
a slight evolution exists today making

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,870
it better you won't really have any

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,650
cloud printing change economy but you

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,930
will have in the first case so if you

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,450
have many newbies coming in you will

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,190
expect to be to need to invent all of

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,880
them a pregnant on a white right

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:50,490
after you become a contributor if we are

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,680
just working with few experienced people

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:58,020
you can assume many things that they

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,370
already know how to do so what this

00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,850
might take away for me

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,830
yeah drop about four ideas look what

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,620
other people are doing what other

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,540
projects are doing there's usually

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:14,640
something interesting you can pick from

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:16,830
there sometimes it's just won't work for

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,339
you for example I have tried something

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:22,230
like these remember the milk system

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,170
which many people like for time

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,170
I mean it did not cover something so

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,430
yeah quiet out but if it doesn't work

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,430
look for something else

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:38,640
and what's also important is that you

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,240
met people you know what you're actually

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,490
doing what I find as a contributor most

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,920
annoying is maintaining a black box

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,470
you drop a patch on the mailing list and

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,170
suddenly it's a stream and you have no

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:56,070
idea when was it accepted as somebody

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,410
where you do and so on and yeah I don't

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,630
want to go up calling other people are

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,810
just if they have merged something so

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:06,420
I've always tried to let people know hey

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,400
I should like your pension but I also

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,800
need to let people know hey I will not

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,930
apply your patch because it has this and

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,260
that problem or because it's going into

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,450
the one direction and what's also

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,400
important is to let people know why

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,320
you're virgin today do I want to reject

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,110
it because you're a mean person but

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,510
because you think it's not a correct way

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,370
to go for the project

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,410
well perhaps which others say okay it's

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,750
quite right just through those little

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:38,370
changes and let them know which changes

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:40,770
you are looking for of course especially

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,500
if you if you are maintaining a very

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:46,950
busy job system you will have to catch

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,230
lots of edges toward you and lots of

00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,660
edges and mostly this and there so make

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,850
another one waiting and sometimes you

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,070
just don't have the time or maybe you're

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,170
on vacation and your backup plan to you

00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,630
know is sick or something like that and

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,520
just think that I said okay so it can't

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,950
just move into it think me in two weeks

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,630
if I haven't come to it something like

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:13,830
that that's also very helpful for

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:17,190
contributors and speaking of Omalu

00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,960
it's always good to spread the load of

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,810
course what I can't hear our robotic

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,580
overlords automatically iock scripts and

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:29,080
so on if you can automate it

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:31,720
have you done access if you have for

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,080
example the journey our project has been

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,360
using the pets you servo now I see

00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,010
people are sending petrol stood I am

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,149
emailing this there a process by which

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:46,000
you and I can look at the status and if

00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:47,950
something for example fails to compile

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,870
it break something I already see it in

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,079
text you and I don't really have to have

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,899
you that serious again that's really

00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,760
really helpful because you can go on and

00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,490
look at the slavers try to the plan you

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,350
notice it's broken if some automation

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,120
tool has already caught us these

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:09,310
problems it's called force you have more

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:12,850
time to ourself and another resource so

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:15,760
to say out of course other developers if

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:18,339
you have been long for around for some

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,680
time you usually know who is an expert

00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:24,040
in what and who it may be able to help

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,170
you for example review something or whom

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,390
you may ask if they have any idea how to

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:34,029
best to handle some interaction so do it

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:38,649
ask them and it's very likely that we

00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:40,740
they will actually help you and yes of

00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:44,020
course general public as I said before

00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,790
proctors talks and so on also helpful

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,800
because they may affect intercept to

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,610
whom a when you become valuable

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,610
contributors

00:12:53,829 --> 00:13:02,290
now total squishy user the Venus meet

00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:04,540
the we usually don't have computers who

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,779
have who the golden these are you beings

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,519
and human beings have also different

00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:11,860
preferences it's not just the project

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:16,209
and different and it's not just you

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:18,189
yourself or different it's just the same

00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:21,129
some some people within a careful

00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:23,829
planning others are more flexible and

00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:26,019
jumping around and stuff that's all it

00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:28,420
can all be very valuable contributors

00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:32,139
but you have to be able to deal with

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,639
this and on top of this of course people

00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:37,779
have different cultural background

00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:40,779
somebody from Asia is a different me as

00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:45,429
somebody from Central Europe for example

00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:46,209
like in speech and how cut you will be

00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:51,399
here and so on

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:54,069
and yeah language Paris can also be with

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:57,429
your problem I I think we can assume

00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:59,319
that people know some basic English so

00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:02,829
and can express clearly expressed

00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:05,350
thoughts and language but sometimes

00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:07,569
there are idioms which our people may

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,939
not understand tell me stuff like that

00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:15,009
and that can cause some friction which

00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:17,949
is not at all intended and coming to

00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:20,709
this company the really cool stuff this

00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:23,709
you get to work with a lot of people and

00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:27,339
but they sometimes really have their

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:31,569
things which are which I'd like to call

00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:34,029
drugs then some maybe somebody doesn't

00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:38,949
like to code on Saturday or whatever

00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:40,600
that would be sweet example but she like

00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:43,449
something you know for some people you

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,480
can do it jokes and so on and they will

00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,549
actually enjoy it and with other people

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,519
it's much better if you say I don't

00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:54,220
affect and just point to the things and

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,119
they're happy if this William French you

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,230
know what other people they like okay

00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:01,960
you're Petra's right

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,150
I have to know the first people home

00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,850
nice your patches and I mean I came hard

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:09,790
on the one thing I don't like yeah it's

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,410
an extreme example but different people

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,590
like different stuff and I've been there

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,790
and of course you have also look what

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,010
the people are doing and are they're

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,140
doing it for a living is that somebody

00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:23,890
who has worked for 20 years in the

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:27,460
industry and a painting company that is

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:30,970
a very different developer from somebody

00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,370
who is just maybe in school or

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:37,270
university has discovered an interesting

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:39,430
coat rack I'm just taking it you want to

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,230
deal with those people differently of

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,570
course you're talking obviously from

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,120
beingness especially if people are using

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:50,290
alias I mean even that was awesome but

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:56,080
yeah just try to be a bit aware that

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:57,670
there may be really different and coming

00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,280
of the u.s. maintainer

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:03,100
can sometimes fall into traps what I

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,460
call here the dictator and employment

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,680
both are extremes both are not very

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,200
conductive either to you or to the

00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,380
project if you want to control

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,900
everything you have every every little

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:20,140
type of graphic thing in your common is

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,670
exactly to your liking and if you look

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,490
at everything and weather everything

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:27,160
you'll be dead especially if you are

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,870
maintaining a busy subsystem because

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:34,030
there's constantly stuff floating in and

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:36,100
yeah nobody can deal with that exactly I

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:43,300
mean some people can I have no idea how

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:45,820
to do it but yeah morph of the cart and

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,830
I think sometimes some the hardest thing

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,230
is to accept the patch which is

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,450
completely fine that's what it is

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,460
supposed to do and it works fine and

00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:58,270
it's documented and all it's just not

00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:00,190
the way you would have done it and being

00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,620
able to merge such a Pettit that's also

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,450
a sign that you can give that not

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,910
falling into I'm falling into the

00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:09,460
dictator Trevor now they have the other

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,140
de stream which are called the dormant

00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,230
when

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,140
everybody is walking over you if you

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,209
just accept I'm just coming to say hey

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,060
everybody everything people as long as

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:24,390
you and you do it push back if they are

00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:27,060
really going into silly directions that

00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:29,880
is also not helping because people know

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,700
are you are easy target let's just flush

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,230
it in my lap maintainer maintain is much

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,960
being so overly critical

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:42,030
no bad way to go

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,760
and one thing I also wanted to point out

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,500
because many people are working for

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,010
companies they are also sometimes

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,260
company politics influencing what they

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,660
are doing for example if somebody is

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,330
working on a project and they have some

00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,070
and they have planned for the company it

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,290
needs to be done needs to be upstream

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:04,140
they will push for supportable stuff

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,510
sometimes just to get it upstream so

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:11,310
they can report to their superiors hey

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:13,320
upstream and and you need to show them

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,660
that it's not because you are meaning

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,340
that you are not allowing accordion but

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,340
because they are problems of the country

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:30,990
yeah and of course it does not like you

00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:33,630
we all want to be nice to beings arguing

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:36,410
in a polite way with each other and the

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:40,950
helpful way and get greatcoat back but

00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:43,110
that's not reality especially if people

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:48,390
who are really passionate about their

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:51,900
work and want to and and really care for

00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:55,680
what they are doing and maybe also have

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,470
kind of temper then it can get really

00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,900
really heated and well that that should

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,510
not be served and stuff like that and

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,210
people are leaving because they can't

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:11,490
stand it anymore and as much what you

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:14,250
want it happens especially if you are

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,680
one of those persons who is likely to

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:19,890
have a temper sometimes we leakage to

00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,960
just a peck don't want that image are

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,880
saved in a draft folder I thought that a

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,640
lot of people

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,920
do that and it's just ended the next day

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:34,250
and you will have completely rewritten

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:36,290
that angry that can happen and what's

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,660
even worse the few I see I see two

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,570
valuable contributors just going head to

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,040
head with over some issue and us if I

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,790
stand a second what are they arguing

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,320
about

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:50,780
they want really the same thing then

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,940
sometimes good if you can find it a kind

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,370
of neutral third party and just pink

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,830
someone offline hey can you trust put in

00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:03,020
some soothing words yeah sometimes can

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:06,050
really help and smooth it out again but

00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:08,900
of course they are like they are always

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,330
twelve sometimes a bit of funny funny

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,960
trolling can be very entertaining in the

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,760
right context but mostly it's a lot of

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,560
counterproductive and there wasn't

00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,900
always people and sometimes people at

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,270
the sidelines like the family flames I

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,240
just stared up a because that's

00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,550
all can also be a bit of fun but yeah

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,830
it's probably the best you need to be

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:35,090
aware that they are certainly are those

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:39,680
people and try to be find out if you can

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:43,840
defuse the situation somehow and with a

00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,610
as I said before rejecting ideas is

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,890
sometimes it's just not the direction

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:51,710
you want the project to take sometimes

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,750
the botch they are taking just cannot

00:20:51,710 --> 00:21:00,020
work at all even if you would like the

00:20:53,750 --> 00:21:02,810
direction then it is sometime may you

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:05,420
always need to separate the idea and the

00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:07,820
code from the person it's not the person

00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,680
that the person is done usually not they

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,680
are usually very very clever people if

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,390
they are actually a nerve in a situation

00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:19,880
that they are able to produce patches

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:22,610
for Q mu no Hado so try to find a way

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,110
that that you can tell hate it's cool

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,480
that you are working on that kind of

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,870
stuff but I am afraid at one part

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,870
because

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:40,370
and that brings me to the last place and

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,370
that is you yourself as a maintainer

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:50,070
yeah so this is what we put the ring is

00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,320
either being a maintainer or being a

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:56,070
developer Cannon Beach I'm really quite

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,649
accessible it just happens you have lots

00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,500
of work to do even if everybody is very

00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:03,480
nice and still

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,970
yes you have to deal with sometimes of

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,390
tricky technical issues you have to deal

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,169
with tricky people you may be a tricky

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,590
person yourself

00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:16,770
he happens that's probably what you can

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:19,350
change a bit and be healthy so what I

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:21,500
personally found helpful is just not to

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,390
set a time apart Rustom yourself as much

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,960
what at least once a day to get a clear

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:31,380
head do whatever you need to get your

00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,970
head clear maybe some to the walk

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:40,110
outside if the weather is reasonable

00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:42,179
crap some people for some soccer game or

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:44,700
whatever football table soccer game

00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:47,460
that's always very helpful I have the

00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,370
experience or do some video gaming with

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:54,210
something whatever you need to just

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:56,520
flush your brain because sometimes it's

00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,169
not even very heavy I think most people

00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,909
thought I've been coding you sometimes

00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:02,190
you are sitting and staring at the code

00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:03,779
and it just won't work out and then you

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,419
just do something completely different

00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:07,950
from when you come back ok that's where

00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,260
the problem is and the same thing

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,120
happens when you are maintainer you just

00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,039
have all those people wanting something

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,230
and watching something that you have to

00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,899
talk to these entities

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:23,580
yeah just perhaps take a little walk and

00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:26,010
meta everything that is if you have

00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,770
somebody you can shut off that's always

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,720
really really helpful it may be somebody

00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,960
who is familiar with what you are doing

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,780
so you can

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,730
oh I do they are doing to do this in

00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,070
this curry immune system and they

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,750
actually understand what you are talking

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,900
about whether she have you a subsystem

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,220
this but sometimes it's other it can

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,140
also be your friend who's doing

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,060
something completely different and you

00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,550
can trust known a bit as they were not

00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:55,720
actually and ain't even have a cup of

00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:59,440
coffee and it that can also really help

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,360
and what's also important to know is

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,550
that you are not the only maintain on

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,580
the world obviously yeah many many

00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:09,550
people and if you can't just talk to

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:14,290
them exchange experiences with them and

00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:16,150
find out what works for them and on the

00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:19,540
same time you to tell you to tell them

00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:22,030
what worked for you that's also yes you

00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:25,440
are not feeling isolated yes I think I

00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,440
feel a really important thing

00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:34,060
yeah but sometimes your stuff just back

00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:36,600
you may know you may feel you are in a

00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:41,620
position which it has become untenable

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:43,870
for variety of reasons it's sometimes

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,970
it's just it's so much stuff you are

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,430
doing this and this and it's basically

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:52,540
all very interesting but it's just way

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:54,130
too much and that's what that's where it

00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,380
comes in what I mentioned some slides

00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,170
before just look around there are

00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,450
usually other people as well there may

00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,010
be some people who have been working on

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:08,530
topics including

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:11,590
ask them can you get a few maybe maybe

00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:14,080
they really be able be willing to or

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:16,480
take over you come a co maintainer or

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,330
the subsystem maintainer under you

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,730
something like that find some people who

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,850
can set up test systems for you so you

00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,080
don't have to do it yourself this

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,480
that's usually a thing that developers

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,380
are not very good at sort of so it's two

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,630
people who can set up test systems and

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:39,790
all of that that can really have just a

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:42,790
lot but sometimes you have been working

00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:44,740
at one area for a long time you have the

00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:48,360
complete expert you know everything you

00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:52,450
know every you know what

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:58,900
what's your device change ending in is

00:25:52,450 --> 00:26:01,750
optional or something like that and yes

00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,640
and you're feeling you're stuck you your

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,880
chest and you don't see anything you are

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,580
no wise and that's okay sometimes you

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,809
you may be able just to move on to a

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,780
neighboring interest

00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:15,400
singing don't be don't become stuck if

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,620
you don't feel you are getting anymore

00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,200
anything anymore or derful even if you

00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:24,010
are the expert find others who can you

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,679
can infer past your expertise tool and

00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:28,809
see which if you can't even find

00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:31,450
something else which you which will be

00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:34,390
more interesting for you in the long run

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:36,940
it doesn't it doesn't really help if you

00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:42,669
end up doing something you don't enjoy

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:44,950
doing anymore and the next coin is

00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:46,600
something I find very important don't

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,940
let yourself be forced to do something

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,210
that is doing you harm maybe you are

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,730
working and working in a company your

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:58,900
company has been lucky in getting that

00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:01,150
new try it Y ver upstream but then you

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,540
you find out you are not a very good

00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:07,299
maintainer that rock is not the kind of

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,910
work is not what you are good at doing

00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:11,950
you are much better off for example of

00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,870
interacting with other people having to

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,940
deal with requests and so on is

00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,799
something that completely stresses you

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,809
out and there

00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:21,129
some companies there can be pressure you

00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:25,720
are the expert you need to be the

00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:27,789
maintainer and yes if if it's something

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,649
that was actively hurting you because it

00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:34,090
is completely giving account against

00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:35,799
your fast Authority not good I know that

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,679
sometimes options are limited what you

00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:43,149
can do that but hurting yourself is

00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:46,450
never a very good idea so that comes for

00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:49,119
last time that's why I used a picture

00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:52,389
here sometimes it's just time to move

00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,609
one if you are not feeling well there or

00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:57,970
if you are just feeling bored it also

00:27:54,609 --> 00:28:00,519
happens move on there's nothing better

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:03,669
than that nobody is telling you to be

00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,249
weathered to the same thing a piece of

00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:08,409
code or the same area of expertise for

00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:10,570
holding for the whole of your life that

00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:13,359
would be willing to meet some people

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,179
like to do the same stuff for 20 years

00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:18,009
or so that's also absolutely fine but if

00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:21,879
you find that you are just being

00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:23,619
strangled or I haven't in no just find

00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:26,049
something else there's usually some kind

00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:28,919
of way you can do it even if you have

00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:28,919
other ways

00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:55,200
this isn't really a question it's

00:28:51,389 --> 00:29:02,460
something I'd like to ask to you should

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:04,259
say no it's a mistake I've made the pet

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:10,950
comes along and I look at it and say

00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:13,549
okay this is terrible idea I'm telling

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:16,889
that to the submitter would be awkward

00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:21,120
what I do instead is I shoot a truckload

00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:25,679
of holes in this floor patch in the hope

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,960
they despair go away what they do is

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,750
they do a lot of work on the patch they

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:36,120
come back now it's even more awkward to

00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:38,990
tell them this terrible idea has

00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,990
happened to me as well

00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:49,130
how do you and you talked about not

00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:51,320
being to credit evaluation every single

00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:53,210
character perfect you know but sometimes

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,100
you just you know patches where you know

00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,560
maybe the grammar is not right or you

00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:00,260
know the the style is not exactly right

00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,060
it's actually much faster to just modify

00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,580
that like how do you handle it but it's

00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,140
actually the patch is not my work so I'm

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,790
not sure how maintainer czar actually

00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,310
supposed to handle that or what's

00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:13,190
generally accepted if I need to let me

00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:15,680
modify the action so what I usually do

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:18,160
if it's only just a minor typos or stuff

00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:22,040
like that were just rephrasing the

00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,960
commit message I I say I am going to

00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,450
apply it but I'm going to use that

00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,820
commit message and I'm trying to get an

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,860
art from the original offer and then our

00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,890
merchants will change commit message and

00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:37,420
fill at a comment that that I modified

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,420
the commit message or even like that

00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,650
so one of things you alluded to is the

00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,390
fact that we can diffuse a lot of hatch

00:30:46,650 --> 00:31:03,929
situations if that maintained as

00:30:48,390 --> 00:31:05,610
themselves just I think it would be

00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,570
quite interesting to enjoy with our

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,910
maintainer

00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:17,460
especially someone like you who was my

00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:19,860
hair to subsystem maintainer yeah maybe

00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:26,940
trust something meeting online and

00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:27,809
chatting a it sounds like an

00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:42,830
interesting idea

00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:42,830
I can form an email myself so

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,760
so I suppose if there are maintenance

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:59,230
here some of them might be you know so

00:31:52,760 --> 00:32:02,780
maintenance some of them might be using

00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:05,450
so as a maintainer of project using one

00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:08,150
workflow I think you should try

00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:10,790
contributing to a project just like for

00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:13,370
a weekend hack to a project that uses

00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:16,970
the other workflow because then you

00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:19,190
understand what contributors go through

00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:23,900
when they are used to give happen they

00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:26,210
come to your email based workflow and

00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,330
they cannot understand even how to send

00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:32,890
a patch on the other hand also the other

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:35,330
way around so when people are used to

00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:37,460
email based workflow they come to it

00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:40,210
happen and see that patches are squash

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:45,170
into one big commit and they don't

00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:47,240
understand they are both completely

00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,600
different world so again both completely

00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,680
different workers but they are also

00:32:49,600 --> 00:33:00,350
workers that have their own merit so you

00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:02,000
are not the one that has the truth even

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,640
doesn't matter if you're using the old

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,240
one or the new one try to put yourself

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:17,800
in this because sometimes even

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:20,630
experienced programmer might just yeah

00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,480
yeah that's a very good idea just get

00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:26,090
the different perspective I have a

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:30,400
question about a very long series when

00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:30,400
you're 80 or 120 purchase

00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:48,800
but I don't if I don't see use of that

00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:52,280
feature yeah if you if you'll see just a

00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:55,160
large pipe series with 80 pencils or

00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,840
whatever you can say okay what I'm going

00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,270
to do with it there's about to be

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,770
somewhere in there some little thing and

00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:04,580
that people will send all of the 80

00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:06,860
pages again I don't want that so and I

00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:09,260
also can understand the problem that if

00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,570
you are introducing some new API that

00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:15,620
you also want to be able to see what the

00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:18,770
API is supposed to be used for so what I

00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:21,860
would suggest is split it up into an API

00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:24,740
apart into the usage but each a bit more

00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,860
manageable and and say okay that's the

00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:32,600
API part and here over here that's the

00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:34,700
actual user of it and so an interested

00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,940
person can just look and say okay that

00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,919
is what they are trying to do and it

00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:43,550
makes well you easier and it makes it

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,379
even a PID easier because you understand

00:34:43,550 --> 00:35:08,780
what they are trying to ultimately

00:34:45,379 --> 00:35:12,170
accomplish you can without having before

00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:14,180
yep I think another thing I would add is

00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,220
if you're not quite sure how you want to

00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,960
structure what's going to work for the

00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,940
maintain in it you can always kind of

00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,010
just send out an email that says this is

00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,410
roughly go I mean does this structure

00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,170
work or would you rather

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,730
therefore my best much nicer to receive

00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:41,349
as a mine tighter than unlike an icy

00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:43,480
patch practices so if you're gonna face

00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:45,490
the eventual question of what is the use

00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,289
of this API it also helps to actually

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,880
have people who are willing to appear on

00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:50,859
the mailing list saying I want to use

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,450
the API because then the maintainer

00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:54,819
doesn't have to decide you already have

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:56,589
what looks like pre-built user community

00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,849
so you need to find allies who are

00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:02,009
willing to actually make that statement

00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:02,009
once the patch series to publish

00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,460
do you think it's up to the maintainer

00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,320
to find reviewers of the code because

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:20,600
there are some subsystems where you come

00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:23,750
and ignored by the maintainer and what's

00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:26,660
going on like well try to find somebody

00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,640
who's doing your work and you're not

00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:31,640
familiar the community what do you think

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,710
about such manners or such attitude do

00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,630
you think the maintainer has to review

00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,600
all the pictures on the mailing list

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:40,250
I think the maintainer can't review all

00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,430
the patches on the main that's plenty

00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:45,590
impossible I think that's where you need

00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:49,220
to bring in other people but it's not

00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:51,560
only your the new contributor you have

00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,540
never interacted with community so just

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,400
find among the people and you don't know

00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:58,730
somebody who was willing to marry other

00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,370
stuff that's not really helpful it's

00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,930
what I would call p2 is just look at

00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:06,560
this here was to some very very

00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:08,660
high-level review and maybe just think

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,730
some other people and say here you argue

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,130
your have done something different

00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:16,010
can you help where you the serious and

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:19,100
then when the many and the contributor

00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:21,470
comes back I can actually actively want

00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:23,600
them to those persons and hey they have

00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,700
looked at your craft last time please

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,370
try to include them as well and try to

00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:31,540
collect revenues folder I think that's

00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:34,220
what it's it's just the initial

00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:37,130
initially the maintainer should help the

00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:39,700
new contributor find other people but

00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:42,590
after some time you can expect public

00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:45,730
contributor that they are able to find

00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,730
out find people themselves

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,210
thank you

00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:11,940
[Applause]

00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,940
