Title: Extending Secure Encrypted Virtualization with SEV-ES - Thomas Lendacky
Publication date: 2018-11-14
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	AMD has enhanced the capabilities of its hardware-based memory encryption to further extend the security protections provided by Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). This talk will focus on the Encrypted State (ES) technology which extends the SEV support to minimize exposure of the guest register state for added isolation and protection from the hypervisor. The presentation will discuss the technical details of this technology with a focus on how it is being integrated into KVM.
