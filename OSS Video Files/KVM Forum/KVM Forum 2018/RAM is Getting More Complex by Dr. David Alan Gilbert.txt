Title: RAM is Getting More Complex by Dr. David Alan Gilbert

Description: 
	QEMU models 'RAMBlocks' which used to mostly actually be RAM or ROM; over time they've slowly got more complex. We've got huge pages, non volatile storage, devices, shared memory.
I'll talk about the different types, and talk about some of the problems they can cause from migrations point of view.
