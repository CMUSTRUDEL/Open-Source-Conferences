Title: Facilitating Incremental Backup by Eric Blake
Publication date: 2018-11-17
Playlist: KVM Forum 2018
Description: 
	As any good sysadmin will tell you, collecting data backups are essential for future recovery needs. But making them more efficient and flexible has been an ongoing quest, involving multiple improvements throughout the virtualization stack. In this talk, Eric Blake will give a demonstration of the newest technique available through the qemu+libvirt stack, which now support the ability to orchestrate online incremental backups where third-party clients can grab just the dirty clusters at their own speed, rather than waiting for qemu to push a full backup image to a destination location.

I have worked with libvirt and qemu since 2010 as part of the Red Hat virtualization team. In that time, I have spoken at several conferences on topics related to virtualization; most recently as a presenter at KVM Forum 2015 and a BOF session lead at KVM Forum 2017.
