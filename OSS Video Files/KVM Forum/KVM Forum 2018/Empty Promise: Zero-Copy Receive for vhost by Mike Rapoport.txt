In para-virtual networking with virtio-net/vhost, the copying of packet between the hypervisor and the guest is one of the major sources of the overhead, especially for the large packets. And, although, zero-copy transmit was merged into the Linux kernel a few years ago, the "receive side zero copy" item is still in the KVM NetworkingTodo, and probably will remain there for some more time.

Our attempted approach to implementation of zero-copy receive for virtio-net and vhost that leveraged receive-side steering abilities of the modern high speed network cards didn't improve anything and just moved the bottleneck to another place.

The talk presents what we've tried, why we thought there will be an improvement and what were the reasons for their absence .
