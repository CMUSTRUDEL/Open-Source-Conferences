Description: 
	Torwards a more scalable KVM hypervisor(Wanpeng Li) - The kvm hypervisor is at the core of cloud computing, Virtual Machine based approaches to workload consolidation, as seen in IaaS cloud as well as datacenter platforms, have long had to contend with performance degradation caused by synchronization primitives inside the guest environments. These primitives can be affected by virtual CPU preemptions by the host scheduler that can introduce delays that are orders of magnitude longer than those primitives were designed for. In this presentation, Wanpeng Li will introduce Paravirtual TLB Shootdown which can mitigate TLB Shootdown Preemption issue. In addition, he will also introduce Exitless IPIs to scale large VMs, and disable mwait/hlt/pause vmexits to improve latency for dedicated instances.
