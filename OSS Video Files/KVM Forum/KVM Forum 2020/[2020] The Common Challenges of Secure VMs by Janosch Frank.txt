Description: 
	Secure VM technology on multiple architectures has been introduced in the last few years and is slowly gaining ground. The goal of protecting VMs against accesses and manipulation from the hypervisor can be achieved in many ways. However the challenges to get a secure VM up and running are mostly the same no matter the architecture and secure VM technology.  Let's have a look at the goals that secure VMs want to achieve, the challenges that need to be overcome to run them and how the architectures solved them. Also let's try to have a look into the future which will bring us secure VM migration, dumping and more device support and try to anticipate the challenges that are still waiting.  If we take a step back and have a look at the problems that are common to all architectures we might be able to find a common solution.
