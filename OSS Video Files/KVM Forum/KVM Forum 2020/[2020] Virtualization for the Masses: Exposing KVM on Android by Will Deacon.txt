Title: [2020] Virtualization for the Masses: Exposing KVM on Android by Will Deacon
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	Despite virtualisation hardware being implemented in all arm64 Android devices, it is seldom available to KVM and instead tends to run bespoke payloads targeting security and data isolation.

The Android-KVM project at Google aims to extend upstream arm64 KVM to cater for the requirements of mobile guest payloads. Of critical importance is the notion that the host cannot access guest memory without the explicit permission of that guest. This requires a split between the KVM code at EL2 and the host kernel at EL1, along with standardised communication between the host and its guests for mutually controlled shared memory instantiation and a degree of portability between hypervisor implementations.

This presentation will offer a quick tour of the arm64 virtualisation architecture before diving into some of the challenges and open problems that we have faced while enabling KVM for Android.
