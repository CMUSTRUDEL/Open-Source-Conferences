Title: [2020] A KVM-unit-tests and KVM selftests update for aarch64 by Eric Auger
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	The KVM/aarch64 code evolves very rapidly. There are lots of features brought by each and every new ARM specification revision. Unfortunately the ARM related commits in the KVM test frameworks does not really follow that pace and span. KVM-unit-tests and KVM selftests frameworks are the most popular ones. This talk will introduce both of them, explain what they are meant to be used for and how they complement one another. This will be illustrated by practical examples picked up from recently added tests (PMU event counters, ITS MSI controller, migration, microbenches, ...). The KVM/aarch64 test code base will be compared with other architectures and the most pressing needs will be highlighted for each test framework. This should be a valuable input for developers willing to lean about KVM/aarch64 and quickly ramp up on both the test frameworks and new KVM/guest features.
