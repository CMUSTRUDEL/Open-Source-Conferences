Title: [2020] Live Migration With Hardware Acceleration by Wei Wang

Description: 
	Guests with memory write intensive workloads are difficult to live migrate and guests with large memory size take long time to migrate. The existing solutions reduce the amount of data to migrate using extra CPU cycles to compress the memory or perform delta operations to migrate the updated bytes. Those do not work as fast as expected, and optimizations like multi-threading compression consume lots of host CPUs. This talk introduces some features enhanced to the migration framework to use hardware accelerators to process the guest memory. Initial results with QAT-based compression show ~5x larger migration throughput compared to compression using 16 CPUs, which consequently supports higher guest dirty rate and has shorter migration time. DSA-based delta operation is work in progress and it performs better when the delta encoding rate is higher than the compress rate.
