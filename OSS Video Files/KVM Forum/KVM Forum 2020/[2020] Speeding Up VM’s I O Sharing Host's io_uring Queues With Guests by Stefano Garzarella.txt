Title: [2020] Speeding Up VMâ€™s I O Sharing Host's io_uring Queues With Guests by Stefano Garzarella
Publication date: 2020-12-09

Description: 
	io_uring is the newest Linux I/O interface. It provides submission and completion queues for performing asynchronous I/O operations.

The queues are located in a memory region shared between the userspace application and the kernel. This aims to reduce the number of syscalls required for I/O operations and provides a way to poll efficiently. io_uring achieves good performance and it makes exposing submission and completion queues to guests an attractive idea for improving I/O performance in virtualization.

Stefano will give a brief overview of io_uring API. Then, he will illustrate how the host's io_uring queues can be shared with guests to improve I/O performance of a block device and which io_uring changes are required to safely give queues access to the guest. Finally, Stefano will show the performance boost achieved with the proposed approach and future steps.
