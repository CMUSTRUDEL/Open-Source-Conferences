Title: [2020] Building Cloud Infrastructure to Deploy Microservices as Microvm Guests by Matias Vara Larsen
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	This talk presents a proof of concept solution that evaluates a cloud infrastructure to deploy microservices by relying on microvm Qemu machine, virtio-fs and virtio-vsocket. Microservices run as Toro's guest, a dedicated unikernel to deploy all-in-one embedded applications into the cloud. We highlight the following benefits when using microvm machine, virtio-fs and virtio-vsocket: reduced attack surface, deployment of several VMs in a single host, continuous deployment due to the short booting time, easily VMs configuration and simplified unikernel architecture. The infrastructure is built on top of a CephFS cluster thus allowing VMs to share a common filesystem. During the talk, we present the architecture of such a cloud infrastructure and the current implementation. We discuss technical challenges and ongoing work. The tutorial and scripts to reproduce this infrastructure can be found at https://github.com/torokernel/torocloudscripts.
