Title: [2020] Scalable Work Submission in Device Virtualization by Hao Wu

Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	Hardware I/O virtualization techniques, such as PCIe SR-IOV and Intel Scalable IOV, allows devices to be shared by multiple clients (e.g. VMs) with minimal emulation cost. However, some devices may not allow fine-grained partitioning of its backend resources, thus imposing a scalability limitation. ENQCMD (Enqueue Command) is a new instruction on future Intel platforms to allow scalable work submission for such devices. The instruction payload includes the work descriptor and a unique PASID to identify the client who is submitting the work, thus allowing a single work queue to be shared between multiple clients. In this talk, Hao will introduce the ENQCMD concept and how to efficiently virtualize it through hardware/software extensions, based on the example implementation on Scalable IOV based device.
