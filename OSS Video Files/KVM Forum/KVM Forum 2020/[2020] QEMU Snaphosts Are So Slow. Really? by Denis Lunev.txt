Title: [2020] QEMU Snaphosts Are So Slow. Really? by Denis Lunev

Description: 
	QEMU snapshots made via savevm interface are at the moment synchronous and slow. This happens not only due to not optimal code but also due to a gap between migration and block layer concepts. This presentation tries to cover this gap and provides some approaches to faster make snapshot and revert to snapshot operations. The talk will cover optimizations to the currently available synchronous SaveVM interface and will also cover asynchronous operations, including asynchronous revert to snapshot, which would require developing a memory page index for migration stream.
