Title: [2020] Evolution of SPDK vhost Towards Secure Container Storage Service
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	Secure container provides strong isolation for multi-tenant, serverless workloads. Generally, it is light VM based, like Kata containers and Firecracker. It is already used in production by top CSPs. Previously, SPDK vhost application has been widely adopted for storage virtualization. While SPDK applications are polling based, and require hugepage memory. But for container scenarios, host resources are always oversubscribed in order to serve thousands of light VMs. This means reserved hugepage and polling pinned CPU cores are hard to be tolerated. So SPDK vhost should keep evolving to fit the requirement from container scenarios. In this talk, we will go over what evolution SPDK vhost requires and how polling pinned CPU and hugepage are avoided. With the new improvement, SPDK vhost will be a good choice to provide storage service to secure containers.
