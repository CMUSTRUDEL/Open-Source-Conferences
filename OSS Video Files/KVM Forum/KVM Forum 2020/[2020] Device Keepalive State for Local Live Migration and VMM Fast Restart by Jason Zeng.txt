Title: [2020] Device Keepalive State for Local Live Migration and VMM Fast Restart by Jason Zeng
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	Passthrough devices are painpoints of VM live migration or VMM/Host upgrade. Currently there are community discussions and approaches to support passthrough device live migration, however they usually require vendor specific driver support, which is also a painpoint for legacy devices. This topic will introduce a new device state, keepalive state, for passthrough devices and other related hardware and software components to support local migration and VMM/host reboot. The new keepalive state doesnâ€™t require vendor specific driver support for most legacy devices. It keeps devices and other related hardware alive during the local live migration period. In this topic, we will present the design and implementation of the kernel and Qemu changes for supporting keepalive state.
