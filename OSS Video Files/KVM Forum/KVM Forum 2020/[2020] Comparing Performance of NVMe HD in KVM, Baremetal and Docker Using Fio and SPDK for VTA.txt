	Full name: Comparing Performance of NVMe Hard Drives in KVM, Baremetal, and Docker Using Fio and SPDK for Virtual Testbed Applications

As it is known, the highest performance using a NVMe hard drive in a KVM guest is achievable using vfio-pci passthrough. Docker also allows PCI devices to be passed through. A lot of work has been done comparing some combination of drives in some combination of those platforms using some industry standard methods and parameters. But, how do they scale up when we want to add multiple drives per guest/container vs multiple guests/containers with one drive each? How about fine tuning memory/numa/iommu as we might also be passing out other CPI devices? And, and we want to build, test, and collect data in a reproducible way? Some ansible and shell scripting involved.
