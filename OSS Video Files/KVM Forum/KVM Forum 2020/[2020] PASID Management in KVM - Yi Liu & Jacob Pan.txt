Title: [2020] PASID Management in KVM - Yi Liu & Jacob Pan
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	PASID (Process Address Space ID) is a PCIe capability that enables sharing of a single device across multiple isolated address domains. It has been becoming a hot topic in I/O technology evolution. e.g. as the foundation of SVA (Shared Virtual Addressing) and SIOV (Scalable I/O Virtualization). Although PASID itself is a generic concept, different usages/requirements are imposed cross vendors thus bringing an interesting challenge to PASID management in Linux. This talk will first review the PASID usages, introduce the IOASID (I/O Address Space ID) core logic in Linux, and then elaborate the gaps/solutions for efficient PASID management in KVM/VFIO.
