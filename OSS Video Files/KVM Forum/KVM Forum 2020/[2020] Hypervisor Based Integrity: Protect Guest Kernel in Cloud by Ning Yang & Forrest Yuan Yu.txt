Title: [2020] Hypervisor Based Integrity: Protect Guest Kernel in Cloud by Ning Yang & Forrest Yuan Yu
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	There are multiple efforts from the community that tries to bring Virtualization based security into the industry and there are a number of papers published every year to discuss the benefit of this approach. Hypervisor Based Integrity(HBI) is product Google Cloud is currently investing to be the public offering for such security hardening in the Cloud. The talk will cover the place where this implementation fits in the Cloud environment, the relationship between this mechanism and other security enhancement for the Linux kernel, what HBI can protect/monitor, special challenges encountered along the road. In addition, it will also cover an overview of the new hypervisor security kernel module Google plans to upstream and show how all hypervisor/VMM can easily implement the support for it so guest VM can move across different providers while getting the same security guarantee.
