Title: [2020] Challenges in Supporting Virtual CPU Hotplug on SoC Based Systems (like ARM64) by Salil Mehta
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	Recently some attempts have been made to add support of the Virtual CPU Hotplug for ARM64 in QEMU virtualizer and Linux Guest Kernel but this has got mixed reviews from the community. Where some vendors have practical reasons to have such a support added, on the other hand some community members have apprehensions about its support. Idea about this talk is to:
1. Present the motivation of Virtual CPU Hotplug support on ARM64
2. Quick Overview
3. Problems in supporting Virtual CPU Hotplug 
    - ARM64 System Arch constraints? 
    - Host KVM
    - QEMU Virtualizer
    - Guest Kernel
4. Discussed Workarounds to the knowm limitation or problems
5. Existing work/attempts made to upstream (short mention)
6. Problems being faced in up-streaming.
7. Question/Feedback's
    - Feedback from people how to proceed and avoid the current deadlock.
    - Should Virtual CPU Hotplug support depend upon existence of Physical CPU Hotplug support?

He is also a co-author and an official kernel maintainer of Huawei's on-chip integrated NIC driver HNS (HiSilicon Network Subsystem) across various multi-core server chips (Kunpeng920 and earlier) and has contributed at different phases of its development. His recent efforts have been towards adding the support of the Virtual CPU Hotplug on ARM64 based systems and enabling the support of the XDP (eXpress Data Path) in the HNS Driver for existing and upcoming Server Chips.
