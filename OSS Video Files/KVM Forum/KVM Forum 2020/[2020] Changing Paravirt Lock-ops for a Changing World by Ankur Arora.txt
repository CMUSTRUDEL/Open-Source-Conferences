Title: [2020] Changing Paravirt Lock-ops for a Changing World by Ankur Arora
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	Paravirt ops are set in stone once a guest has booted. As an example we might expose `KVM_HINTS_REALTIME` to a guest and this hint is expected to stay true for the lifetime of the guest. However, events in a guest's life, like changed host conditions or migration might mean that it would be more optimal to revoke this hint. This talk discusses two aspects of this revocation: one, support for revocable `KVM_HINTS_REALTIME` and, second, work done in the paravirt ops subsystem to dynamically modify spinlock-ops.
