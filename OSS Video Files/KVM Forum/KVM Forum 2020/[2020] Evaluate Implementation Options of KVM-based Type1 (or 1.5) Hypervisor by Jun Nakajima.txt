Title: [2020] Evaluate Implementation Options of KVM-based Type1 (or 1.5) Hypervisor by Jun Nakajima
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	We share our evaluation of KVM-based Type1 (or 1.5) hypervisor (KVM++) to discuss which option is the best for the community, showing the pros and cons of the implementation options. At the last KVM Forum, we showed a high-level architecture of KVM++, where we can isolate guest memory from the host except the areas for I/O buffers, in order to better protect and isolate guests. In terms of the implementation, one extreme is to run it as a KVM guest on top of a hypervisor that consists of KVM/mini-Linux. At the other end, we deprivilege it with almost everything passthrough except memory access. The former requires nested virtualization if KVM is used on the host Linux. The latter doesnâ€™t. Those implementations can affect overhead and latency of the systems as well, and the implication and impacts can depend on the platform (i.e. client vs. server).
