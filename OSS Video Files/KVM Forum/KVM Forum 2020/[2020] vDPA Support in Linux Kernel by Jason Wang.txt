Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	vDPA device means a type of device whose datapath complies with the virtio specification but with a vendor specific control path. In this session, the support for vDPA in Linux Kernel will be presented. A brief review of vDPA about its history, motivation and status will be briefed first. Then the design and implementation of kernel vDPA subsystem will be discussed. vDPA kernel subsystem is designed to work for any type of vDPA device with the flexibility to be easily integrated with new hardware technologies. The vDPA kernel subsystem cooperates with virtio and vhost subsystem for providing a unified and safe API for kernel virtio and userspace vhost driver to use. Vendor vDPA hardware driver is required for accepting request from vDPA subsystem and translate them to vendor specific command. Management integration and future work will be covered at the end of the session.
