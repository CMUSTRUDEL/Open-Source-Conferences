	Andreea Florescu
Amazon, Software Development Engineer

I am a software engineer with the Amazon Web Services Firecracker team. I am passionate about open source and, beyond Firecracker, I am also contributing to rust-vmm, a community effort to create a shared set of Rust-based Virtual Machine Monitor components. So far Iâ€™ve been talking about both rust-vmm and Firecracker at Fosdem, EdgeSys, Open Infrastructure Summit and KubeCon.
