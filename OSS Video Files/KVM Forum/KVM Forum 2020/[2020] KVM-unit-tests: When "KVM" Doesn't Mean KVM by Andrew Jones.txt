Title: [2020] KVM-unit-tests: When "KVM" Doesn't Mean KVM by Andrew Jones
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	kvm-unit-tests is a tool created to help develop KVM. Like many tools, while it was initially intended for more specific tasks, other applications of it have emerged over time. For some of these new applications, KVM isn't even in the picture. We present the evolution of kvm-unit-tests, from its origins to current day, describing how the unit test framework can support multiple targets with no impact to test code. We also make suggestions of new targets and framework enhancements for the further generalization of the tool.

Andrew Jones
Red Hat, Principal Software Engineer

Andrew (Drew) has been involved in system software development for almost 20 years. Drew has focused over half of those years on Virtualization, starting with pHype at IBM, and then continuing with Xen and KVM/QEMU at Red Hat. For the majority of the last decade he has been leading a team at Red Hat which has the objective of bringing Red Hat's enterprise virtualization stack to AArch64 servers. Additionally, from his first official task as a Software Engineer in 2001, which was to port a test suite to an embedded platform in order to fuzz an RTOS, Drew has kept software testing a top priority. Regarding AArch64 KVM testing, he contributed and maintains the KVM selftests AArch64 port, as well as the Arm/AArch64 support for kvm-unit-tests. His contributions to kvm-unit-tests also include the initial PowerPC support and several framework enhancements which apply to all supported architectures. Drew presented an overview of kvm-unit-tests at KVM Forum 2015.
