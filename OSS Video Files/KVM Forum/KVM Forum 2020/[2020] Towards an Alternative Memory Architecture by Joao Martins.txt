Title: [2020] Towards an Alternative Memory Architecture by Joao Martins
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	We waste a lot of memory managing guest memory (ironic eh?). And in today's cloud ecosystem PCI passthrough is important and an increasing commodity. This gives us an opportunity to make a mean and lean hypervisor which can shed some of its layers. This talk discusses memory efficiency, particularly focusing on one of its oldest overheads: per page metadata. Particularly on what it means to strip that away, what it entails for security and performance, and how the DAX subsystem can be improved to fill in the gap, drawing KVM closer to that of a partitioned hypervisor.
