Title: [2020] AMD-vIOMMU: A Hardware-assisted Virtual IOMMU Technology by Suravee Suthikulpanit & Wei Huang
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	There have been various usages of IOMMU in virtual machines (VMs), especially for supporting pass-through devices within a VM. Several virtual IOMMU (vIOMMU) solutions have been proposed and implemented, which are mostly done in an emulated fashion. This talk will focus on the technical details of a new hardware-assisted vIOMMU technology introduced in the AMD second-generation EPYC platforms. The goal of this technology is to improve the performance of vIOMMU for pass-through devices. We will discuss how the support is implemented in AMD IOMMU driver for when it is running in the host, as well as how it is being modified to use the v2 I/O page table for DMA-API when running in the guest. As a proof of concept, QEMU is modified to leverage the vIOMMU hardware via a new ioctl interface. This presentation will cover the implementation details and performance results of our initial design.
