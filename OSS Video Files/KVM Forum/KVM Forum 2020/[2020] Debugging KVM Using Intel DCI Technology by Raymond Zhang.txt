Title: [2020] Debugging KVM Using Intel DCI Technology by Raymond Zhang
Publication date: 2020-12-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2020
Description: 
	Debugging KVM using print/log is inefficient and has many limitations. This talk will introduce a new way to debug KVM using the Direct Connect Interface (DCI). DCI is a new technology introduced by Intel Skylake. It exposes the Intel Target Probe (ITP) and JTAG scan chain to USB 3 ports so that host computer can build a JTAG connection with Intel silicon via a USB 3 cable. For the transportation lay is USB 3, it's very fast. Besides the transferring speed, debugging via DCI controls CPU at hardware level, has no dependency on software. This brings several benefits, such as break in when interrupt is off, break on VM entry and VM exit and single stepping sensitive code in VMM etc. In this talk, Raymond, a veteran Intel architect, will explain the DCI technology and how to use it to debug KVM, both the VMM layer and VM layer.
