Title: [2020] Optimizing for NVMe Drives: The 10 Microsecond Challenge by Stefan Hajnoczi

Description: 
	Solid-state storage devices with request latencies of less than 10 microseconds pose challenges for virtualization. Even small overheads result in a visible reduction of I/O performance. Solving this requires changes to the I/O stack.

This talk covers recommended tuning and current work on improving I/O performance for QEMU guests with NVMe drives.

The first part to achieving good I/O performance is to ensure that the guest is taking advantage of multicore and NUMA effectively. This involves both manual tuning and recently added optimizations for getting the most out of the hardware.

The second part is efficient I/O request submission and completion. Traditionally this involved vmexits and eventfds, but improvements to QEMU's AioContext polling can eliminate them and achieve much higher performance.

Come find out how close to bare metal performance QEMU gets!
