Title: [2019] Protected Virtual Machines for s390x by Claudio Imbrenda
Publication date: 2019-11-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	Traditionally, system administrators have been able to access all data on a running system, including memory belonging to Virtual Machines (VMs). Bugs in the hypervisor have also allowed cross-VM attacks.

A new upcoming feature for the s390x architecture will prevent those security issues, allowing VM guests to be protected from a broken or malicious hypervisor, without using memory encryption, while at the same time requiring a minimum amount of changes in the guest.

This presentation will introduce the technology, the architectural extensions, the unique features, and how KVM and Qemu have been adapted to exploit it. The presentation will also cover the typical lifecycle of host and guest, including interactions with the firmware.
