Description: 
	Full name: QEMU-Hexagon: Automatic Translation of the ISA Manual Pseudcode to Tiny Code Instructions of a VLIW Architecture - Niccol√≤ Izzo, rev.ng & Taylor Simpson, Qualcomm Innovation Center

The QEMU frontend is automatically generated: the authors have extracted and formalized the pseudocode of each instruction from the ISA reference manual and implemented a translator.
This translator transforms the pseudocode to C code to be embedded directly in QEMU which performs instruction decoding, textual disassembly and generates the equivalent tiny code instructions.
This approach reduces the implementation effort and allows to easily add new instructions.

The other interesting aspect is the fact that Hexagon is a VLIW architecture: it runs bundles composed of up to 4 parallel instructions that might also feature data dependencies.

This talk also wants to be the starting point for upstreaming our frontend, which is now almost feature-complete.
