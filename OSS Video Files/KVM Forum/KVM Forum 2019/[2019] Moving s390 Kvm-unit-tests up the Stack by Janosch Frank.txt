Title: [2019] Moving s390 Kvm-unit-tests up the Stack by Janosch Frank
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	Tests from the KVM unit tests framework have been traditionally run on only one hypervisor...KVM. But having a clean and tiny test framework has been so invaluable, we started porting it to all s390 hypervisors that are out there.

This allowed new users like hardware and firmware to use it and with the advent of Protected Virtualization became an important part of software and hardware verification.

This talk concentrates on how we used KVM unit tests in the past, how we're using it right now and what lies in the future for s390 (and maybe also other platforms).

Cross and stacked hypervisor testing to the rescue!
