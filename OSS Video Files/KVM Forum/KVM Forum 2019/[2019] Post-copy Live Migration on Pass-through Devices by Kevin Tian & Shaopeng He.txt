Title: [2019] Post-copy Live Migration on Pass-through Devices by Kevin Tian & Shaopeng He
Publication date: 2019-11-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	As we all know, post-copy can greatly reduce live migration down time for devices with memory intensive usages. While it is possible on emulated devices, live migration with post-copy technology on pass-through devices is still not supported. In this session, Yan will explain detailed benefits and show you a generic solution in VFIO on how to migrate pass-through devices with post-copy technology and Shaopeng will expose performance statistics of using post-copy on migrating SRIOV VFs on Intel NIC.
