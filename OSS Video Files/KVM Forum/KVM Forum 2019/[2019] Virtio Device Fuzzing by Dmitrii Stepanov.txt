Description: 
	For the cloud providers it is important to keep private user data secure. One way to achieve it is to fuzz the interfaces available to the guest, to find new vulnerabilities and ways of exploitation. One of such surface is the emulated devices used by the guest machines.

We present the approach to fuzz virtio devices based on AFL to find a bugs. We evaluate this approach by
fuzzing the virtio devices in SPDK and QEMU. Find several crashes, hangs and filed new CVE (CVE-2019-9547). Also to make the approach useful for our Cloud production case, we integrate it with the CI for each release.
