Title: [2019] Toward a Virtualization World Built on Mediated Pass-Through by Kevin Tian
Publication date: 2019-11-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	Mediated pass-through provides many merits, e.g. flexible resource management, easy-to-scale, composability, etc. while still sustaining good user experience regarding to performance and feature. While VFIO introduces basic mediated pass-through support (mdev) since kernel 4.10, there are many inspiring values to be further explored atop. In this talk, Kevin Tian will introduce their work on extending VFIO mdev framework in three main areas: enriching the portfolio of mediation capabilities efficiently, using mediation framework to bridge hardware gaps, and bringing mediation capability in nested virtualization environment. Along the road mediated pass-through could become a corner-stone toward uncompromised cloud experience in pass-through usages.
