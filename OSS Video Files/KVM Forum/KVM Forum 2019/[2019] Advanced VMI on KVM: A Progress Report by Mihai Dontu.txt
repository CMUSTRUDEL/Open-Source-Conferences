Title: [2019] Advanced VMI on KVM: A Progress Report by Mihai Dontu
Publication date: 2019-11-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	This talk is a follow-up to our 2017 one called “Bringing Commercial Grade Virtual Machine Introspection to KVM”. Since then we have made a lot of progress with regards to performance and stability, and are also on track to include support for three Intel features that can greatly help with scalability: VMFUNC, #VE and SPP. We also came across a surprise: in our tests, the speed of the more involved guest-to-hypervisor communication channel used on KVM (BSD sockets on top of vhost-vsock) comes very close to Xen’s lightweight event channel. And we have the numbers to prove it.
