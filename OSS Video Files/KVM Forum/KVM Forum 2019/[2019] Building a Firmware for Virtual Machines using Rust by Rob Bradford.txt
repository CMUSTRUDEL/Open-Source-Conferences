Title: [2019] Building a Firmware for Virtual Machines using Rust by Rob Bradford

Description: 
	In the recent past there has been an explosion of innovation in the technology area around Virtual Machine Monitors (also known as hypervisors) based around the Rust programming language including Google’s crosvm for ChromeOS, Amazon’s Firecracker for containers and Intel's Cloud Hypervisor project.

One defining aspect of all the Rust hypervisors that are active or under development is that they do not use a traditional firmware for booting the guest operating system and instead boot directly into a Linux kernel under the control of the host. This limitation makes it much harder to use the hypervisor to provide a general purpose Virtual Machine, often known as a “pet”. In order to mitigate this we have developed the Rust Hypervisor Firmware to allow these Rust based hypervisors to load customer controlled operating systems and enable a wider range of uses.
