Title: [2019] Efficient Performance Monitoring in the Cloud with Virtual PMUs by Sean Christopherson

Description: 
	Virtual Performance Monitor Units (vPMUs) are usually disabled in todayâ€™s KVM-based clouds though some runnable vPMU code has been in the upstream for several years. Consequently, profiling software inside virtual machines becomes a gap in the services that cloud vendors can provide. The main barriers are 1) the existing vPMU provides inaccurate profiling results in some cases; and 2) the advanced vPMU features, e.g. LBR and PEBS, have not been supported as they are not designed with virtualization in consideration.

To tackle the above issues, the existing vPMU is optimized by avoiding some heavyweight host perf operations. Tests show that the optimization can greatly reduce the emulation overhead of guest PMU operations with ~3000x boost, and achieves near-native efficiency. In addition, for the first time the virtualized LBR and PEBS features are brought to the clouds.
