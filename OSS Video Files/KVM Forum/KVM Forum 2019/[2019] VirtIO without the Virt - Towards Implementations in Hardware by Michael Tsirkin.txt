Title: [2019] VirtIO without the Virt - Towards Implementations in Hardware by Michael Tsirkin
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	VirtIO was designed to standardize hypervisor interfaces for virtual machines - but we are beginning to see the emergence of Virtio hardware. This talk will answer the questions: why does this make sense, what works and what are the issues hardware implementations of virtio have to overcome?
Topics to be covered:

- What is the difference between hardware virtio devices and virtio data path accelerators?
- What are the minimal requirements of virtio in hardware?
- How can we handle compatibility, including hardware bugs and limitations?
- How to make live migration work? What about overcommit?
- Which changes included in the recent virtio specification help design hardware virtio devices?
- Which known issues remain and how does the Virtio committee plat to address them?
- Why design Virtio in hardware? Are there alternatives?
- Why get involved with the Virtio specification process?
