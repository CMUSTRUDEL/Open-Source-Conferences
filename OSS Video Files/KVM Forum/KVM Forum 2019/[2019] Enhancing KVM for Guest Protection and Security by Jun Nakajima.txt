Title: [2019] Enhancing KVM for Guest Protection and Security by Jun Nakajima
Publication date: 2019-11-12

Description: 
	We have been working on KVM to better protect and isolate guests, and propose a more secure and yet simpler architecture, where 1) guest memory is isolated from the host except the areas for I/O buffers, 2) no MMIO emulation is used. Since it piggybacks on the Linux systems, KVM tends to have more attack surfaces compared with other VMMs, making the guest more vulnerable. For example, the kernel or QEMU can easily access data of the guests today. Even if we have memory encryption technologies, itâ€™s also easy for them to corrupt data of the guests (accidentally or intentionally) or use potential side channels.

In our architecture, we need to make limited changes to guests, but this provides more protection and simplification, compared with other approaches like XPFO, where the user-level still has access to the entire guest memory. We share our experiences and data based on our PoC.
