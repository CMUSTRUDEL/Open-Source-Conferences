Title: [2019] Nesting&testing by Vitaly Kuznetsov

Description: 
	Nested virtualization on x86 is finally becoming a thing: lots of work has been done recently to eliminate bugs and make it faster. Testing, however, remains a challenge and regressions even for KVM-on-KVM are, unfortunately, not uncommon. Adding third party hypervisors (Hyper-V, VMware,...) and different types of L2 guests to the picture also doesn't make it any simpler.

The talk will try to cover the existing KVM testing frameworks: kvm-unit-tests and selftests, what these frameworks test and what they don't, the gaps we have between VMX and SVM. Possible improvements and additional testing approaches will be suggested. Overall, this is going to be an open discussion on how we can test nested virtualization better.
