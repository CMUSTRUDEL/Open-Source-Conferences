Title: [2019] Bring QEMU to Micro Service World by Xiao Guangrong & Zhang Yulei
Publication date: 2019-11-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	Recently more and more services, particularly micro services, have been moved from VMs to containers. Due to container's native infrastructure, cloud providers are seeking tech to create a more secured multi-tenant environment such as firecrack from AWS.
But using a dedicated hypervisor for micro service would bring extra burden to develop and maintain respectively. Furthermore, the improvement we add for one could benifit another. How about leveraging QEMU to fulfill the requirements of micro services? That is exactly what we did at Tencent Cloud.
We will share our works to adapt QEMU to fast deploy intensive micro services in a extremely short period ( less than 35 ms) with less resource utilization which is comparable to containers that includes directly starting a VM from the parent, C/R QEMU to start a new VM, modularizing QEMU, reducing resource usage for both QEMU & Linux VMs etc.
