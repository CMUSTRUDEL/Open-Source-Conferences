Description: 
	Virtualization technologies build the infrastructure of cloud computing. However, with more and more VMs and workloads running on cloud, traditional virtualization technologies exposed some weakness under cloud environment, i.e., virtualization overhead, performance fluctuation, and higher cost overhead, etc. ZERO is Huawei’s next generation virtualization platform – targeted achieving 4 '0's: '0' reserved for CPU, '0' reserved for memory, ‘0’virtualization overhead, and ’0’ performance fluctuations. By designing ZERO virtualization chip, ZERO System offloads overhead to ZERO chip&card, including all network I/O, all storage I/O, and all cloud control plane. By designing split-hypervisor, ZERO leaves a very small and silent hypervisor at X86/ARM server, therefor improving overall resource utilization and performance. Currently ZERO1.0 has been launched on Huawei Cloud, supporting both VM and bare metal instances, and supports both X86 and ARM server.
