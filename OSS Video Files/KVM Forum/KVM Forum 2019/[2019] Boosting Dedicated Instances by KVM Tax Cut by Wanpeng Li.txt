Publication date: 2019-11-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	The KVM hypervisor is at the core of cloud computing, some customers from financial, online shopping, and gaming etc more prefer the dedicated instances to avoid resources contention from multi-tenant, and the security can be guaranteed by isolation. However, without more hypervisor optimizations, cloud providers still can't provide performance that is "indistinguishable from metal."

In this presentation,we will introduce some features which can reduce the tax from kvm hypervisor for dedicated instances include: Exitless Timer, KVM_HINTS_DEDICATED performance hint, allow userspace to disable MWAIT/HLT/PAUSE vmexits, adaptively tune advance lapic timer and adaptive halt-polling in guest/host to reduce latency.
