Title: [2019] Seamless Cloud System Upgrade with VMM Fast Restart by Jason Zeng
Publication date: 2019-11-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	Frequent updates (software and firmware) become a major pain point to Cloud Service Providers. There have been some approaches to address this, for example hot patching, live migration, etc., but there still have some limitations for each of them. VMM fast restart tries to propose an alternative solution, which leverages kexec-based fast rebooting of host machine while keeping VM states in memory across reboot, to achieve short service downtime, high success rate and low management overhead.

This talk will introduce the technical approaches, current status of development, and future plans of VMM fast restart. Related challenges will also be described in this talk.
