Title: [2019] Towards the Higher Level Debugging with QEMU by Pavel Dovgalyuk
Publication date: 2019-11-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	QEMU includes gdbserver emulator which is capable of debugging the whole emulated system, including firmwares, drivers, and BIOS code. However, debugging with a multi-process operating system is tricky, because GDB does not distinguish the processes within the guest.
In this talk authors discuss the approaches for making the debugging better: detecting the processes, inspection of the address spaces, instrumenting the code, mapping the executables, and so on.

The talk also includes overview of the new debugging stub for QEMU which allows using WinDbg without switching the guest system into the debugging mode.

Pavel Dovgalyuk is a software developer in Institute for System Programming (ISP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS). The activities of the Institute include fundamental research, software development, applied research for the benefits of the Industry, and education. For the last 9 years he has been working on the project which aim is adding deterministic replay, reverse debugging, instrumentation, instrospection, debugging, and analysis to qemu. Part of this work was already included into mainline QEMU. Pavel presented execution record/replay work at KVM Forum 2014, and instrumentation/introspection approaches at KVM Forum 2017.
