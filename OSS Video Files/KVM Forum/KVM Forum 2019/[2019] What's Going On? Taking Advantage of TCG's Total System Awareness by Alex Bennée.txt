Description: 
	When emulating a system using QEMU's Tiny Code Generator we must inspect and translate every single instruction that gets executed. As we completely control the system we should be able to extract some interesting information about how the code executes. While other code instrumentation systems exist (DynamoRIO, Pin, Valgrind) QEMU is unique in supporting system emulation as well as not requiring the host system to have the same instruction set as the guest. In this talk we shall discuss how we can answer some interesting questions about programs running under QEMU. We shall examine some of the drawbacks of QEMU's current introspection support. Finally we shall discuss if a plugin system will allow for more detailed experiments without comprising our ability to continually improve the quality of our emulation code.

Senior Software Engineer

Alex started learning to program in the 80s in an era of classic home computers that allowed you to get down and dirty at the system level. After graduating with a degree in Chemistry he's worked on a variety of projects including Fruit Machines, Line Cards, CCTV recorders and point-to-multipoint wireless microwave systems. Since the turn of the century his primary focus has been working with FLOSS platforms, especially Linux. For the last five years he's been working at Linaro helping improve QEMU's emulation features. A keen Emacs user he will happily answer questions and proselytise for the One True Editor (tm).
