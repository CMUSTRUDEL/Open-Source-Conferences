Title: [2019] Managing Matryoshkas: Testing Nested Guests by Marc Hartmayer
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	The nested virtualization functionality is one of the key functionalities of modern hypervisors. Yet, one central quest is to find an adequate way to write functional tests that check and verify the entire "KVM/QEMU/libvirt" stack in each level of (nested) guest. How can each guest level be supervised, managed, tested without introducing high complexity and without writing duplicated code in each guest level?

In this presentation, Marc Hartmayer will discuss existing test approaches and present an alternative approach by using "self-replicating programs" in combination with the technique of remote proxy objects. Moreover, he will show a demo for a test case in which the pass-through functionality of a device will be tested up to the Nth level. Lastly, he'll give an outlook on how this approach could be integrated into existing frameworks like Avocado and what else could be done.
