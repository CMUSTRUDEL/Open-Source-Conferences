Title: [2019] Multi-process QEMU - Status Update by John Johnson & Elena Ufimtseva
Publication date: 2019-11-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	QEMU can be susceptible to security attacks on the many interfaces it exposes to a guest VM. Each interface is an exposure point that, if compromised, provides a malign guest the ability to assume the QEMU process's host privileges.

A multi-process QEMU involves separating QEMU services into multiple host processes. Each of these processes can be given only the privileges it needs to provide its service.

We introduced this topic at KVM forum two years ago, and hosted a BoF on it last year. In this presentation, we will introduce the work we've done with an LSI SCSI controller model, including how it performs, and what the next steps will be.
