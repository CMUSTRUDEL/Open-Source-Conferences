Title: [2019] Ideal optimal Memory Management for Future VMs by Isaku Yamahata
Publication date: 2019-11-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	We argue that memory management for future VMs ought to be different from the one for Linux processes. Recently new types of memory, such as persistent memory, encrypted memory, are emerging, and they have different characteristics or require different (or additional) operations (e.g. flush caches) in terms of memory management. Although KVM has started to reuse the Linux kernel mechanism and benefited, itâ€™s becoming difficult to keep using the kernel memory management for guests to meet those requirements, while achieving performance and simplicity. For example, various aspects of memory management are different: life cycles, page sizes, page invalidation, page access/modification tracking, memory ballooning, security, and isolation (e.g. from the host). In this session we discuss ideal/optimal memory management for guest VMs, possible implementation options, and preliminary PoC.
