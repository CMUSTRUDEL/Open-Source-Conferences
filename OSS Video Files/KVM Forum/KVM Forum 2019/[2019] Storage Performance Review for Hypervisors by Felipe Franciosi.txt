Title: [2019] Storage Performance Review for Hypervisors by Felipe Franciosi
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	With the advent of fast storage technologies like NVMe and 3DXP, hypervisors are facing unprecedented challenges. The added software overhead involved in access validations, general data movement and notification between domains is more noticeable than ever. It affects all sorts of performance dimensions including bandwidth, IOPS and latency, most of which have been vastly hidden by the slow nature of devices until recently.

This talk is divided in two parts. Firstly, we will focus on storage performance evaluation and benchmarks, showing how these translate to virtualisation. Secondly, we will dive into hypervisors based on KVM and Xen to compare how they work and discuss how they can deliver the best end user experience in terms of performance and efficiency.
