Title: [2019] Firecracker: Lessons from the Trenches by Andreea Florescu and Alexandra Iordache
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	Firecracker is an open source VMM written in Rust, leveraging KVM to provide isolation for multi-tenant, serverless workloads like containers and functions. It is currently used in production by AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate.

Each Firecracker process has a low memory overhead, it boots virtual machines in as little as 125 milliseconds and oversubscribes host resources in order to pack thousands of microVMs on a single host. But in a multi-tenant environment, the most important requirement is properly enforcing the security isolation of workloads.

In this talk we will go over the design decisions we took when building Firecracker, showcasing the advantages as well as the limitations of this VMM. What does it take to run Firecracker at scale? Are Rust’s builtin protection mechanisms enough to ensure smooth sailing in production? Come and find out!

I am a software engineer with the Amazon Web Services Firecracker team. I am passionate about open source and, beyond Firecracker, I am also contributing to rust-vmm, a community effort to create a shared set of Rust-based Virtual Machine Monitor components. So far I’ve been talking about both rust-vmm and Firecracker at Fosdem, EdgeSys, Open Infrastructure Summit and KubeCon.
