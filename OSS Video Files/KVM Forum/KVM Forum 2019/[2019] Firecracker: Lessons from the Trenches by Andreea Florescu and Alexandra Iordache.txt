Title: [2019] Firecracker: Lessons from the Trenches by Andreea Florescu and Alexandra Iordache
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	Firecracker is an open source VMM written in Rust, leveraging KVM to provide isolation for multi-tenant, serverless workloads like containers and functions. It is currently used in production by AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate.

Each Firecracker process has a low memory overhead, it boots virtual machines in as little as 125 milliseconds and oversubscribes host resources in order to pack thousands of microVMs on a single host. But in a multi-tenant environment, the most important requirement is properly enforcing the security isolation of workloads.

In this talk we will go over the design decisions we took when building Firecracker, showcasing the advantages as well as the limitations of this VMM. What does it take to run Firecracker at scale? Are Rust’s builtin protection mechanisms enough to ensure smooth sailing in production? Come and find out!

00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:10,710
hello I'm Andrea and together with

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,630
Alexandra we are going to talk about

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,960
firecracker and what we learn from

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,690
running it in production so we are

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:32,279
quickly going to go through fire cracker

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:34,640
design okay this is not working I'm

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,640
sorry

00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:48,690
there we go now we're going to talk even

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,420
quicker about design decisions because

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,620
we won't have enough time and then we

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,870
are going to move to the interesting

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,559
part of the presentation which is two of

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,780
our inglorious bugs so firecracker is a

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,000
lightweight virtual machine monitor it

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,949
is written in rust and it was purpose

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,840
built for running multi-tenant workloads

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,940
in the cloud like containers and

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,190
functions it is currently used in

00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,049
production by AWS lambda and it's open

00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,200
source so you can have you can find it

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:19,140
on github the first thing is that

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,420
firecracker is a process and as a

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,220
security measure we decided for

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,080
firecracker to only manage one micro via

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:32,009
firecracker leverages KVM to provide

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,280
isolation for cloud workloads so that

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,340
means that it only runs on Linux and it

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,580
only supports Linux guests we currently

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,009
have support for x86 64 and we started

00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:48,149
adding experimental AR support as well

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,489
AR 64 so firecracker threads first

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,030
firecracker can be configured by an API

00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:57,229
server which is implemented with HTTP

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,690
and communicates with HTTP clients via

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,099
UNIX domain sockets then we have one

00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,379
thread for emulation and other

00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,569
miscellaneous things which is the vmm

00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:12,150
thread and then you can have one or

00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:13,980
multiple VCU threads so since I was

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,959
talking about the VM thread we can look

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,440
a bit more in-depth at this one because

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,950
it's the most interesting one probably

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:26,659
so firecracker does emulation using

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:30,920
virtio and we have block and network

00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:34,319
these are implemented over mmm mmm i/o

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,540
and the block device is backed by a file

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,450
on the host well the net device is

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:43,170
backed by a tap device under hosts we

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,050
also have two legacy devices there is a

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,230
serial and a very very minimal IAT 42

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,999
that basically just supports reset and

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:55,219
sending control-alt-delete which is

00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:55,219
actually the only way that you can know

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:05,409
you can shut down a VM from from outside

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,459
of the guest ok security boundaries so

00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:13,189
firecracker actually comes with a jailer

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:15,980
as well and the jailer does the standard

00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:18,470
isolation of processes including share

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,230
route and Seagram's and we also have

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,000
second so we have second filters that

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:29,180
are applied to every threads in

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,549
firecracker so how what did we achieved

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:35,269
with firecracker so far we have a very

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:38,389
minimal boot time it is around 125

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:40,840
milliseconds now we also have a low

00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:44,930
memory overhead around 3 megabytes and

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:48,049
this is kind of like by default the

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,480
other subscription out of host CPU and

00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:52,730
memory which is actually because we do

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,700
not implement any kind of pass through

00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,349
and you will see the fine print there

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,349
which I hope it's big enough actually

00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:02,359
for everybody to see these properties

00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:04,849
are actually dependent on the workload

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,500
and configuration so if you want to

00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:10,099
actually use firecracker you will have

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,489
to test it for your own use case now the

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:15,530
interesting part of the presentation

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:19,190
this is from a book turn the ship around

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,079
and like in the first pages it says you

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,419
are destined to fail and it really

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,180
impressed me and it made me think about

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:28,220
some other process that we are using

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,990
which is called the co e so you are

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,210
destined to fail and you're most likely

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,070
going to fail but what is important

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,699
actually is what do you do when you have

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,380
failures and what we do at Amazonian

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,080
firecracker is a process called

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,820
correction of errors and we do this

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,810
because we want to think long term

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,729
versus short term so we really want to

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,060
understand what is the root cause of a

00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:54,880
problem and make sure that we are not

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,680
making the same mistakes in the future

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,479
so to understand this and to actually

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,260
get to the root cause we are actually

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:05,870
doing the five whys and we are diving

00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,610
deeper and deeper into the problem this

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,840
is also process that is available for

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,450
you to check if you want to

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,970
and now we can look at the actual bugs

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:18,139
so we have inglourious release which was

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:20,780
actually in glorious releases yeah so

00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,419
firecracker went a bit mad this time and

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,790
the problem was that firecracker would

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:29,510
in terminal in turn I can't say that

00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:32,840
work sorry it would crash with error

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,700
code 128 and the problem was like super

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,650
straightforward it was just like one sis

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,960
coal that was not white listed but he

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,120
had a really big impact because of the

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,770
intermittent failures customers were not

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,620
able to update with the newer fire

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,870
cracker version the fix was again super

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,000
straightforward straight forward just

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,030
whitelist the Cisco but we had two

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,790
versions that were actually affected and

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,410
to understand why did this happened and

00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,180
what's with the error code and

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,370
everything let's first look at how

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,350
firecracker handled second so

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,990
firecracker supports three types of

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:09,020
succumb filters you can have none no

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,000
second basic which only checks the Cisco

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,220
number and then advanced which calls

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,220
which checks the Cisco numbers but also

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,350
the parameters used by the Cisco in

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,970
firecracker this is the default and we

00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,550
are using a whitelist approach and

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,979
whenever we have a Cisco that is not

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,570
white listed we are trapping it updating

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:31,880
metrics such as number of second fault

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:34,010
and we log an error which contains the

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:39,410
Cisco the faulty Cisco and we exit with

00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:42,139
that specific error code 128 now let's

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:46,190
also look at the development firecracker

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:47,510
is on github and too much code into

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,060
firecracker you will have to submit a

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,530
pull request then you will have to

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,139
reviewers that are going to look at your

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,479
code and the firecracker CI which takes

00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:57,200
around 20 minutes and if both of these

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,910
are okay

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:04,310
then we are going to merge the code

00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:07,669
awesome so for actually having a release

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:11,780
we just tag a github comment and we

00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:13,460
create a github release I probably said

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,169
that earlier I don't remember so AWS

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,789
lambda is actually using firecracker in

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,580
production so whenever we have a new

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:22,700
release that is available lambda picks

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,160
it up and now it runs

00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,380
through the lambda CI and the lambda CI

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,780
unlike the firecracker CI is very very

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,790
targeted at their use case so they are

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,830
using in their CI a they are using

00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:38,120
workloads that are very specific to how

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:39,620
they are operating lambda if everything

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,010
is okay it goes to production obviously

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,320
and then if not we have a bug report so

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,750
for the second issue it actually and

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:51,020
ended up on this pad and we had the bug

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:54,500
report and so because it was impacting

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:57,610
we started to understand the whys so why

00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,020
wasn't this met em advised whitelisted

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,960
the problem is that for this particular

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,840
release we do we did two things

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,990
so we first added code which didn't need

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,110
it any Siskel's actually but we also

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:15,050
updated over the arrest version and the

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:19,070
res version had a change in the memory

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,720
handling which generated a new Cisco so

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,690
why did that we catch it in firecracker

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,710
because this was actually not happening

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:30,770
all the time so it was a work low

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,810
specific Cisco in which which was

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:36,170
generated by the way that lambda is

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:38,180
using firecracker and in fact rigueur we

00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:41,270
have to make a compromise between how

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:47,060
long does the CI take and coverage so we

00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:49,040
cannot possibly cover every use case so

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,230
everything must have been good because

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,930
we had whitelisted only that it wasn't

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,270
so in the middle of the night we were

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,870
doing a patch release to fix a patch

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:03,020
release to fix a broken release and the

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:05,810
reason is because if a tiny tiny mistake

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,690
so if you notice like the fix actually

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,400
is very tiny the problem is that this

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,800
syscall was actually only called

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,740
using the muscle was only trigger with

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,600
the muscle build and rust has these

00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,340
conditional compiling so we don't want

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,650
white least the Cisco's if they are not

00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:26,360
used on platforms or on different builds

00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:30,440
the fix here was like super simple we

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:34,100
just needed to update the target what

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,950
did the muscle macro configuration so we

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:41,860
had two broken releases

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:44,420
and then we finally fixed it in 0:15 -

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,990
and because of this we actually started

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,300
to think about corrective actions so the

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,130
first thing was we decided to add

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,130
long-running tests which are not going

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,830
to run along with the CI but was sort of

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,690
like nightly testing because it's much

00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,180
easier this way to spot

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,160
Cisco's that are not white listed we

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,230
also started looking at improving

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,300
secum so we had discussions whether

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,030
white list is actually the good approach

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:14,210
but we didn't really reach a conclusion

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:16,340
here and then like the only thing that

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:19,310
we wanted to actually merge was the

00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,850
auto-generated say comp white list and

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,290
the problem was that fire cracker uses

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,720
right now like 30

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,690
Cisco's and with the auto-generated

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,290
second white list is actually 60 so we

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,190
actually dropped this this whole thing

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,050
we are still discussing about

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,230
improvements because seccomp is way

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:42,290
harder than we initially thought and we

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:45,860
added the second P improvements to our

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:49,130
roadmap for 2020 to keep iterating over

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,190
it so what did we learn we learned that

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,680
testing is important so it's very

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,510
important actually and it's also very

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,910
important to test everything that you

00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:01,630
use all your dependencies with the

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:05,120
workloads that are as close as possible

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:08,630
to production use cases we also learned

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,520
that we discover this issue so quickly

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,640
because we actually have logs and

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,850
metrics so without metrics you wouldn't

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,260
have noticed the intermittent failures

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,390
so log symmetric save the day and

00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,680
engineering time and now I will let

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:27,850
Alexandre talk about yet another

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:31,160
Inglourious bug thank you hey everyone

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,440
so this isn't actually from a book it's

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,150
something that I believe every one of us

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,480
discovered at some point in time I did

00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:40,580
pretty early on math is hard it's hard

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,930
to do right it's hard to do to do it

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,700
right with equations and everything and

00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,260
it's also hard to do right in computing

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,810
because something as simple as an

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,870
addition can overflow and cause immense

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,140
pain reduction

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,880
that being said this is a success story

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,220
this is about a bug that was discovered

00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,590
and fixed by a member of Firecracker

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,070
open-source community it was an

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,480
overflowing integral earth magic

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,610
operation an addition that was replaced

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,740
with graceful error handling and didn't

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:14,100
lead to any to any pain but it did lead

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,720
to an ongoing effort with the

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,850
Firecracker team and with our community

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,280
to harden our code base and improve her

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,900
overall quality

00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,770
so yay successes and in start with the

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:28,470
plus sign so the problem like I

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,600
mentioned was just an addition super

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,940
simple it was in the memory model crate

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,480
which is supposed to read stuff into the

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:43,140
guests memory the potential impact was

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:45,960
if that addition were to overflow either

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,310
the data could go somewhere undetermined

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,490
at the guest memory and cause it to

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,500
abruptly terminate or worse or it could

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:55,050
cause the firecracker process to go down

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,580
and obviously take the guest with it the

00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,380
fix was trivial replace the plus sign

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,290
with a rest native operation called

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,740
overflowing add and we merged that fixed

00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:08,670
and firecracker 0.12 point at have been

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,590
affected so now let's look a bit into a

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,270
potential code path for this error to

00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,750
manifest itself let's say you have a

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:19,380
guest that wants to read something from

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,790
its drive into memory its program is

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,940
gonna call read I could have really used

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,770
a pointer the read is gonna go under the

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,150
guest of rely your block driver this is

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,460
gonna trigger an event that eventually

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,190
makes its way into firecracker into the

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,790
Vertigo block device as under I

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,890
mentioned

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,870
block devices are emulated with files

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,150
and firecrackers so what we're gonna do

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,610
is gonna go read that information into

00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,140
an intermediary buffer and then pass it

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,760
on to the memory model crate which is

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,570
supposed to put it in the guests memory

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,550
now if all goes well the operation that

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,460
you see there in red offset plus count

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,110
will not overflow and the data will be

00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,700
put somewhere where the guest driver can

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:01,460
read it what about if it does overflow

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,190
well one of two things can happen

00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,710
the first is undefined behavior you

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,839
don't know where that data goes and it

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,279
we have a few reasonable reasons to

00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,890
believe that the guest is eventually

00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:16,820
going to have to suffer from that and to

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:19,279
die another thing that can happen is the

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,980
overflow can be caught by the rust

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,010
runtime and take down the firecracker

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,480
process and the guest with it now as

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,830
that would be a bit deep into that

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,800
because I put a new word on it's called

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,560
panic this is a rust native thing and

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,810
let's uh talk a bit about our handling

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,200
an arrest there are two ways you can do

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,910
that gracefully and unless gracefully

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,490
rust offers a result type which is kind

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:46,520
of an enum it can even be okay with a

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:49,100
payload or an error or the payload and

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,350
the reason for that is to make it as

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,330
robust to errors as possible you can

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,740
propagate this result from the function

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:59,480
that's airing out and handle it

00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:01,670
gracefully in the caller for this is

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,770
used for problems that you kind of

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,450
expect problems that you can see coming

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,160
like for instance when you want to open

00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,709
a file if it's not there you're gonna

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,620
return a result and to move it up the

00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:15,650
frame to wherever you want to handle it

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,570
for unexpected problems like an array

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:22,100
being about array index being out of

00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:24,050
bounds rust has a panic mechanism this

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,830
will eventually lead to the process

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,480
being terminated in one of two ways the

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,300
default one is to unwind the stack of

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,970
the panicking thread this is meant to be

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,770
a recoverable error because it only

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,230
takes down one thread and it leaves the

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:42,320
user to maybe recover the program and

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,270
not necessarily die and the second way

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,589
is to just raise Singapore and unless

00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,350
you have a signal handler for that which

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:51,790
we don't the program goes down with all

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:54,290
of its sides firecracker uses the ladder

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,829
we don't just let one thread die we take

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,959
down the entire process but just before

00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:03,020
entering the panic runtime we install a

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:06,140
panic okay this is also a rust internal

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,760
mechanism it's meant to give you one

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,730
last chance to run some custom code

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,130
before terminating the program what we

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,810
do is we flush the metrics to get one

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,100
last snapshot at what for

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,620
cracker was doing at the point of

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:23,290
failure and the logon error message and

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:26,750
then let us trace sig abort and goodbye

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,640
so this is the actual problem that was

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,440
the code snippet where the bug happened

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,890
and the highlighted line is worthy

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,420
overflowing operation was this is the

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,580
read to memory function that is called

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,779
from Verdejo device code among other

00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:43,310
things usually what happens is the Daiya

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:44,930
device is compliant and the verdugo

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,640
driver is nice and doesn't send us

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,529
invalid input and that operation never

00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,580
overflows that it always goes into

00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,640
memory where you want it to go

00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,589
everything works fine what if the faulty

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,839
or if you have a faulty driver and a

00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:00,740
non-compliant device and that operation

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:02,870
can overflow well the behavior is

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,540
dictated to have all things by the built

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:09,439
configuration of firecracker so if

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,240
you're earning in debug mode the rust

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,209
runtime is going to detect the overflow

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,410
and cause a panic that's as I explained

00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,640
earlier raises the keyboard the whole

00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:21,230
process dies but still it's pretty bad

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,400
firecracker dies the guest dies and it's

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,929
a semi controlled mode of termination

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,490
but the thing is we don't ship the debug

00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:33,020
build in production we ship the release

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:35,179
build and then release the because of

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,550
the the optimizations by the rust

00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,890
runtime it doesn't detect the overflow

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,710
and doesn't panic understand address

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,810
standard dictates that this is undefined

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,820
behavior in other words you don't know

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,500
where they get data goes into memory and

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,070
it can go somewhere where you really

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,140
don't want it to wind up and cause

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,300
hopefully the guest to abruptly

00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:00,320
terminate and this is worse than

00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:02,750
firecracker panicking the solution was

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,060
absolutely trivial the plus sign was

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,280
replaced with the rest native

00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,230
overflowing add which is nice enough to

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,780
return a boolean which marks and whether

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,730
an overflow did occur and on the lines

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,590
right after that we turned that boolean

00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,630
into a result which we propagated the

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,660
caller function and eventually makes its

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,340
way into a log being printed and an

00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,990
error metric being incremented and

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:28,850
nobody dies anymore and everything is

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:31,460
fine so why didn't we catch this

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,980
seems like an obvious problem now why

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,420
were there no overflows in checks

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:38,750
overflow checks in place where we had

00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,160
Integra rithmetic well this is kind of

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,650
embarrassing but we didn't actually look

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,690
at that code a lot that particular

00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,980
snippet was unchanged since the revision

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,340
one of firecracker

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:53,270
it was pretty hidden error condition and

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:57,050
we just didn't spot it why didn't the CI

00:18:53,270 --> 00:19:00,140
spot it because even even though in our

00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,900
CI system we do run actual guests and

00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:05,540
they do run several workloads and we

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,690
test as much as we can as close to real

00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:12,280
use cases as we can their drivers worked

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:15,200
fine and Verdejo devices were compliant

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:18,410
so the overflow never happened because

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,430
that input was never invalid a member of

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:24,020
the community spotted this and submitted

00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,770
the report along with the fixed in a

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:30,800
pull request and we're very grateful for

00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:33,710
that and we took immediate action after

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,330
that to see what we can do to spot this

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,910
kind of errors before they get a chance

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,710
to manifest themselves and we wondered

00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,240
if the Ross compiler didn't catch it we

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,100
didn't notice that maybe a linter would

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:48,410
have caught it thing is we didn't have

00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:50,900
one enter rust Clippy it's a linter for

00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,720
rust code it's also integrated in rusts

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,540
cargo ecosystem build command and tool

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,030
chain and it turns out that Clippy did

00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,100
have one category category of linter

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,970
errors that caught this operation and

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,950
others and at the moment we ran it when

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:10,190
this pull request was submitted there

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,750
were over 200 linter warnings pertaining

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,210
to several inter categories like

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:18,110
correctness restriction and style and

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:20,510
more so we figured out that that was

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:23,570
kind of a problem and we kick-started an

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:27,800
effort in the form of github issues to

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:30,200
clean up our code and hard add we added

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,970
a test in the firecracker CI suit that

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,780
once cargo clip eight rated warnings as

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:37,880
errors so if any of the code looks weird

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,430
and the lender doesn't like it the CI

00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,800
will fail and the pull request will not

00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,710
go

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,900
through this is allowed us to find and

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,720
fix some more obscure conditions before

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:52,440
shipping anything to production some

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,610
more overflowing arithmetic some Pointer

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:59,640
castes some non Poynter castes and

00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:02,160
several others we found them we fixed

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,290
them well most of them at least we left

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,340
some cyclomatic complexity warnings

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:09,120
there because some functions are just

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,950
big and since we were at the episode of

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,620
hardening our codebase we took another

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,870
look at all the ways fire cracker can a

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,790
blob abruptly terminate by calling

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,370
either unwrapped or expected to resonate

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:23,010
functions on result objects these

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:26,280
usually take out the value from an the

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:30,120
ok enum but if the UNAM is actually an

00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,470
error the restful panic we took another

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,510
look through these and replaced

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:36,030
everything that was not a serious

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:39,120
program error with error propagation of

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:41,340
result objects we also put Verdejo

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,770
device input fuzzing on a road map this

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,490
we didn't have this at the time we did

00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:49,770
buzz our code before open sourcing it

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:53,400
and before releasing it first but it's

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:57,240
not integrated with CI so we're working

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,130
on in that support as well what do we

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,870
learned we went to a testing is

00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,850
important again that's a lesson that we

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,760
just seem to relearn every once in a

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,620
while when linting is important too

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,360
because some things are not caught by a

00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,910
visual inspection and they're not caught

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,790
by testing and they're not caught by the

00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:17,010
rest compiler in the beginning we asked

00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,510
ourselves if the choice of rust as a

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,760
programming language for fire crack

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,550
would be enough to ensure smooth sailing

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,190
into production and it turned out that

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,560
it wasn't the RUS compiler didn't catch

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,590
this and the CI didn't catch this but

00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,060
the linter did so there are a lot of

00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,250
things that you need to do to make sure

00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,500
that your code is good good enough for

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:41,750
customers and we're still working it's

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,100
an ongoing effort so to wrap things up

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,190
seconds hard math is hard

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,620
this industry is hard and whenever this

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,120
hardship leads to issues we revert to

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,700
this piece of wisdom by Captain Jack

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,720
Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,280
says that the problem is not the

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,929
problem with your attitude about it and

00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,960
our attitude about problems when they do

00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:03,120
show up because they do is to understand

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,980
them to dive deep to ask the five why's

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,130
just keep asking why some until we get

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,850
to root cause of it to fix it and to

00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:13,170
make sure that doesn't happen again

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:21,900
thank you

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:21,900
[Applause]

00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:39,880
what what if any problems did seccomp

00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:44,710
prevent or find so the question is what

00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,870
did any problems ii prevent yes well i

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,990
provides your breakouts or what have you

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:52,480
well we put it there as a preventive

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:56,710
security mechanism we're not aware of

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,890
any problems having showed up that would

00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,799
have been caught by seccomp but we do we

00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,990
only whitelist the bare minimum of sis

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:09,730
calls and arguments that firecracker

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:16,570
needs to to run so dangerous stuff like

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:18,730
clone for instance or blacklisted I have

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,190
a question about the it's more about oh

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,530
sorry it's a it was more about

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:27,250
firecracker to begin with so you you do

00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:29,770
you're vert I Oh for x86 as MMA oh so I

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,360
assume you don't do PCI because of for

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,340
performance reasons right for speed

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,260
because P size would be slower than a

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:40,840
mile why do you do it over MMA oh it was

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,929
the easiest way for us to get started

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,919
that is one of the reasons it's also

00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:49,390
performance but we actually didn't look

00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:51,039
into how it will play out with PCI for

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,440
PCI we don't want pass through or

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,030
anything like that so

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,030
mm IO is just more

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:09,210
I another set comp question so I've hit

00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,220
similar issues in the past and it's

00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,620
always always a pain and the kind of

00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,690
conclusion that I'm starting to come to

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,930
is that if you have a dynamically linked

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:22,260
binary you basically can't use set comp

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:23,820
whitelists especially if it's deployed

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,500
an environment that you don't control

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,060
because those library versions they

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,060
might call new syscalls and things like

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,610
that so you already listed I think on

00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,650
your slides a few ways to overcome this

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,120
whether you're you know you try to get

00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,690
tools that figure out what the Syst

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,700
calls are one thing have you thought

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,510
about that maybe the configuration file

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:48,000
needs to allow basically as a short-term

00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,130
workaround when this happens so you

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,770
don't need to roll another release just

00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,370
allow you to add things to the sacrum

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,600
whitelist

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,620
I mean there's obviously a danger in

00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,320
that have you thought about that the

00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,530
pros and cons we haven't thought about

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,600
that but sounds like a reasonable choice

00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,730
and we will look into that thank you and

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,710
by the way I forgot to mention that but

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,630
FAC record in production is actually

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:18,930
statically linked so that's why we use

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:20,930
muscle any other questions if no thank

00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:24,709
you

00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,709
[Applause]
