Title: [2019] Reports of my Bloat Have Been Greatly Exaggerated by Paolo Bonzini
Publication date: 2019-11-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	Is QEMU bloated? Insecure? Obsolete? What are QEMU's tasks when virtualizing a modern guest, and how do they change for various workloads and scenarios? The aim of this talk is to provide hard data on the security and size of various components of QEMU, explain how the build can be tailored to minimize code size, attack surface and startup time, and give ideas for future development of QEMU. I will also shortly present the tools that helped me gather the data, so that anyone can reproduce my experiments in the future.
