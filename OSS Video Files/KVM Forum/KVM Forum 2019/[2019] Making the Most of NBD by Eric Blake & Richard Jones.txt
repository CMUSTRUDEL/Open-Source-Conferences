Title: [2019] Making the Most of NBD by Eric Blake & Richard Jones
Publication date: 2019-11-09
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	The Network Block Device (NBD) protocol dates back to Linux 2.1.55 in April 1997, pre-dating iSCSI as a means for block device access of remote storage. However, in more recent years, the protocol has seen a revival as virtualization scenarios have used and extended its features for a variety of tasks.

This talk will cover recent developments: new commands (WRITE_ZEROES, BLOCK_STATUS, RESIZE), encryption support (X.509 certificates, TLS PSK), multi-connection throughput enhancement, underlying protocol improvements (structured replies, 64-bit requests), and standardization efforts for a common URI naming representation.

Richard Jones and Eric Blake will also discuss performance improvements, and userspace libraries for easier integration of the NBD protocol into other projects (nbdkit, libnbd). A demonstration of some interesting nbdkit plugins and filters will tie it all together.
