Title: [2019] Hybird^2 Nested VM IO Performance Tuning by Tianyu Lan & Chao Peng
Publication date: 2019-11-12
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	As popular of cloud, more vendors move their business into cloud and nested virtualization technology is used in the production environment more and more(e.g security container and emulation ). Microsoft Azure cloud platform provides nested virtualization support.

The IO performance is still to be a bottleneck for good experience with high through put. This is due to long code path and several data copies among host, L1 VM and L2 VM. Traditional solution is to use pass-through solution and expose virtual IOMMU to L1 VM. But Virtual IOMMU still has a side affect. This topic is to propose a hybrid solution of vhost-user with user space drivers (DPDK, SPDK)plus device pass through(L0 to L1) to accelerate nested VM IO performance. From test result, L2 VM can achieve almost 100% L0 IO performance in some cases. This topic will show our performance result and some challenges.
