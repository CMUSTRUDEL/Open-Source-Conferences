Description: 
	During the Spring Festival Gala, the instantaneous traffic is several hundred times that of normal, and the burst traffic during the activity greatly exceeds the current capacity of the IDCs. At the same time, to ensure the QoS of the mixed deployment online services, the isolation level of various resources is very high in every aspect, not limited to page cache, cpu scheduling capability, memory bandwidth, etc. In this session, Ye Lu & Zhenwei will introduce how the decision KVM-based Hybrid deployment solution is made, the performance optimization at the landing, and the system monitoring after virtualization, such as more accurate network analysis tools to distinguish app backend error, physical network outage, virtualized network failure. The solution help services go through the traffic peaks and improve the overall resource utilization of the IDCs.
