Title: [2019] Virtualized Fibre-channel - Some Years Later by Hannes Reinecke

Description: 
	During the KVMForum in Prague Paolo and me have presented the challenges in implementing virtualized fibrechannel for qemu. However, after some initial submission the entire topic didn't receive much traction.
So here I will be presenting a way on how to efficiently map fibrechannel devices onto virtio-scsi by just updating the mapping information and not modifying the actual data layout.
Thus I've preserved backwards compability with existing implementations and allowed new installations to take advantage of the new implementation.

SUSE Linux GmbH
Teamlead Storage & Networking

Studied Physics with main focus image processing in Heidelberg from 1990 until 1997, followed by a PhD in Edinburgh 's Heriot-Watt
University in 2000. Worked as sysadmin during the studies, mainly in the Mathematical Institute in Heidelberg. Now working at SUSE Labs
as Teamlead for storage and networking. Principal contact point for storage related issues on SLES.

Linux addict since the earliest days (0.95); various patches to get Linux up and running. Main points of interest are storage, (i)SCSI, FC, NVMe, and multipathing. And S/390, naturally.

I'm active on the Linux NVMe and SCSI mailing list, reviewing patches and dusting out murky corners in the SCSI stack.
Plus occasionally maintaining the FCoE stack.
