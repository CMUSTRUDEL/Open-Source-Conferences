Title: [2019] KVMstat and Beyond - Past, Present and Future of Performance Monitoring
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	When it comes to performance monitoring KVM provides sophisticated tools to deep dive into specific aspects. For example kvm_stat or perf allow to analyse the exits from guest mode. On the other hand getting a system level view or having permanent monitoring and analytics is only available for the process view, e.g. with tools like sysstat. Other hypervisors offer a much better out of the box experience.
This talk is about extending the tooling for kvm stats to better integrate into the bigger picture.
