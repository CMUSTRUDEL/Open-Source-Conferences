Title: [2019] Libvirt: Never too Late to Learn New Tricks by Daniel Berrange
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: KVM Forum 2019
Description: 
	A period of increased disruption has begun in the virtualization
space with new applications such as Kubernetes, KubeVirt and Kata Containers
challenging traditional virtual machine usage paradigms. The libvirt developers have responded with self examination, reconsidering historic decisions, identifying what is required to stay relevant to modern developer & application needs.

The talk will outline the many significant changes and plans to come out of this exercise. Dramatic changes to the build system with the replacement of autotools by a cutting edge, easy to use alternative. The benefits of adoption of the glib2 library to replace current APIs and GNULIB. The potential for using the modern Rust and Golang languages. Modularization of the libvirt daemon and enabling daemon-less embedded use of the KVM driver. A switch from email based development to well known web based tooling.
