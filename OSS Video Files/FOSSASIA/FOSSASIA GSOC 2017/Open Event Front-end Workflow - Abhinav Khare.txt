so hi guys I'm gonna be giving a brief

00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:11,680
overview of the open event front-end

00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:14,680
project by fellatio so the opening in

00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,410
project basically is allows the users to

00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,560
manage their events like conferences

00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,360
dogs and has various salient features

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,120
for event management like it can handle

00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,710
multiple sessions tracts venues and

00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,670
there was a support for call for

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:33,670
speakers so now we are proceeding to the

00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:36,880
event creation wizard so as you can see

00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:40,780
it is really detailed you can specify

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,610
most of your basic details of the event

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,940
on the first page itself including the

00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:48,610
logos the descriptions and the organizer

00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,920
details then you can add your tickets

00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:54,550
and order them in the way you would like

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:59,020
and there are a couple more options you

00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:01,030
can see them as you can see next we move

00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,710
on to the sponsors you can add any as

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,689
many sponsors as you like for an event

00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:09,759
or delete them and this wizard itself

00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:12,219
and next comes the session sense because

00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,090
tab you can add the tracks the micro

00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:18,069
locations and session types here as well

00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,009
as you can give the details of the call

00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:23,459
for speaker you can also customize the

00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:28,479
registration form for the speakers call

00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:30,270
