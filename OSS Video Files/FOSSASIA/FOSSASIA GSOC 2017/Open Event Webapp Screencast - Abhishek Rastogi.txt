Description: 
	The Open Event Project offers event managers a platform to organize all kinds of events including concerts, conferences, summits and regular meetups.

The Open Event Web App project has two components a) an event website generator and b) the actual generated website output. The web generator application can generate event websites by getting data from event JSON files and binary media files, that are stored in a compressed zip file. You can also access the application through a REST API. Websites that are generated by the "web app generator" can be uploaded to any web location, e.g. on Github pages or any server (e.g. via ftp).

This video demonstrates the different features of the Open Event Webapp and the work done during the GSoC 2017.
