hey this is Kavita Anaya I'm a developer

00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,680
at Falls Asia and now I'm going to tell

00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:12,340
about my jisub project I've worked for

00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,320
Lok Lak apps and low clock server and

00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:18,110
I've had a few apps in local app apps

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,570
page you can search apps by typing my

00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,630
name so first let me tell you about

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,880
emoji heat mapper app when you click on

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,510
the app it gives you the details of the

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:34,719
app that is how to use it and all so

00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:37,489
let's try this app now so here you can

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,649
see that there are two buttons here one

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,809
is emoji map and other one is emoji heat

00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:47,019
map so first let me show you

00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:50,449
emoji heat map here you have a search

00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:58,690
query drop-down so when you select an

00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:58,690
emoji and give a search

00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:10,380
you can see few marks on the map so in

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:14,790
the similar way this emoji he imaging

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:19,050
map when you're given search query it

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,810
also displays the currents of Imogene

00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,210
Twitter tweets and also the sentiment

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:30,510
data of the emoji so as you see as you

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:33,750
can see in the map and the sentiment of

00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:39,180
emoji is John few other apps which have

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:41,369
worked on our emoji heat map so here we

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,010
need not give any search query instead

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,460
all the emoji occurrences from the

00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:50,180
tweets are tracked and showed on the map

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,160
that is displayed on the map as heat map

00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:57,180
my next app is compared with a profile

00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:08,670
app and also Twitter followers inside

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:10,350
app as you can see how in a PPT for

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,540
search query we have to give two queries

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,660
that are user names of the Twitter

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,660
profiles and give compare button so it

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,860
gives the comparison of two profiles in

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:26,240
a table format in the Twitter followers

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:30,030
insite app when you give a user name as

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:35,280
query it gives two pie charts that is

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:38,160
followers and following as you can see

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,410
in this screenshot followers and

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,370
following and it is aggregated according

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,720
to the country they stay in and it also

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,830
displays the followers and following

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,530
list which are in clickable format and I

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:57,920
also worked on one-click deployment

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,920
buttons initially the one-click deploy

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,220
one click deployment buttons that is

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:09,000
Heroku scale mo bluemix and docker cloud

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,250
where based on and build so since low

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,769
klux over a change to Gradle build I had

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,870
to change them to cradle build and I

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:19,140
also added a new button that is I

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:23,069
one click button which can create cloud

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:26,550
instance on I show one click I show

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,709
cloud so this is the low clock server

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,349
repo here you can see the one-click

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:36,269
deployment buttons when you click on

00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:37,860
deploy to assure we are taken to this

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,810
window that is deployed I show window

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,129
where the default values are given

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:53,760
already given we just have to follow the

00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:57,390
next button and then click on deploy our

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,700
app gets deployed and we get a public IP

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:04,769
address through which we can access our

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:12,209
low clocks over so here when you click

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:20,150
on manage your resources this is the

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:20,150
public IP we can run the public IP law

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,960
so the cloud instance of Lok Lak serving

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,450
