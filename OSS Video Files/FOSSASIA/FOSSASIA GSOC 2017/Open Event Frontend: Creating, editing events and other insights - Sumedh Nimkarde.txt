hello everyone so this video is about

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,880
google Summer of Code work product of

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,580
the open event front and a freshly new

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,700
front-end was created which was

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,130
initially tightly coupled with the open

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,050
event of a server so throughout the

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,300
summer a fresh new front-end was created

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,269
by the open event front-end guys this

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,109
video will be a tour how to use the open

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:31,080
event project first of all I'll let you

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,590
know what the open event project is so

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,070
the open event project is a simplest way

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,100
to create events manage events for

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,860
example if our manager has to organize

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,030
any conference concert or short regular

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:51,570
meetups anything he can organize it very

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,270
quickly very in a simplest way he can he

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,410
can add sessions you can add tracks you

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,539
can add sponsors they can sell tickets

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:04,049
so that is the open event project so

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,119
we'll start with creating an England so

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:11,729
now we are at the event creation wizard

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:17,450
where you can create an event entering

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:21,780
some data over here you can set the

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:24,720
dates of the event also you can set the

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:29,070
description what your event is about you

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:33,180
can have even image you select the logo

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,939
which you can add you can add tickets

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,610
over here whatever the quantity of

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:43,790
tickets you want to have free tickets

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:46,250
paid tickets and you can reorder them

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,230
up and down wherever you want different

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,120

top it can also be said plus the code of

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:05,540
conduct can be set over there plus you

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:09,740
have the license when you intend data

00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:13,150
content so we will proceed to it the

00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:16,610
next part which is adding the sponsors

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,830
so you can add the sponsor for your

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,250
event were here for example I'm adding

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:25,280
Google developers the level is rendering

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:29,560
the type of the sponsor is this room yes

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,560
you can add a logo for them you can add

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:39,910
you can add the description you can add

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,910
a URL

00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,870
the third part of the even creation is

00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,970
the sessions and speakers where you can

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,680
add the speakers called enable the call

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,750
for speakers option you can add

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,569
different tags for example I'm hiding

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,310
over here is open-source

00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:00,709
now the micro locations where the unit

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:05,269
is going to happen everything you can

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:08,150
add you can add accession types also we

00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,890
have provided the validation that will

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,959
ensure that you do not send an empty

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:21,140
form for the fields that are necessary

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:30,859
so yeah session type and then call par

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:32,810
speakers you can set you can have the

00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:37,250
dates for call for speaker whether it is

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:43,370

00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:53,840
and this is the page where you can

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,150
manage the event this the left part

00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,639
indicates the fields that we are filled

00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:03,379
for the event is live at this site the

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,470
information about the event you can add

00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:13,629
roles for the people for example I like

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:16,489
a rule for person as an organizer so I

00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:20,660

can just modify it and add throw plus

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,590
the sponsors are shown on the right side

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,970
and the ticket summary on the right side

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,400
also since the open event provides a

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:39,800
facility to generate the Android and the

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,060
