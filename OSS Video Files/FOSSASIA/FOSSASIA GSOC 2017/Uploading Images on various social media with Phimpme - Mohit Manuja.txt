00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:21,319
API token by using that API token we can

00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,869
authorize the user when the user is

00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,840

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:30,229
a access token now using that API token

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:35,509
an access token we can easily upload any
