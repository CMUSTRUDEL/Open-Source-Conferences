As mobile applications are becoming more complicated, we often find it difficult to understand the application thru static analysis. With Dynamic Instrumentation - a dynamic analysis technique, it enables the analysis of application behaviour at runtime, by injecting the instrumentation code into the process. This talk aims to discuss the use case of Dynamic Instrumentation in the context of Mobile security on various mobile operating system platforms and how you can embed this technique into your bug hunting toolkit.
