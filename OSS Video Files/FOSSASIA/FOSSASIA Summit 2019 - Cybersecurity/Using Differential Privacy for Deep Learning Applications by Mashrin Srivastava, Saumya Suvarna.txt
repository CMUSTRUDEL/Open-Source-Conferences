While data science is enabling advancement in various disciplines, the fear of sensitive personal information being leaked is a hindrance to the adoption of data-centric methods in applications which use recommendation engines based on sensitive user's data, medical data for health AI, and more.

With the advancement in the field of AI, while the algorithms might be trusted, the output might unintentionally reveal sensitive information, compromising the privacy. There is a need to rethink privacy in the age of AI. Simply anonymizing data doesn't ensure privacy.

One of the proposed techniques to improve privacy is differential privacy. Differential privacy provides a mathematical guarantee that your privacy wonâ€™t be violated even if your data is used for analysis/ training. It allows the analysis while protecting sensitive data and can be used to maximize accuracy while minimizing the risk.

In this talk, we will discuss the pros and cons of differential privacy from a machine learning and deep learning perspective and the determination of the optimal balance between accuracy and privacy.
