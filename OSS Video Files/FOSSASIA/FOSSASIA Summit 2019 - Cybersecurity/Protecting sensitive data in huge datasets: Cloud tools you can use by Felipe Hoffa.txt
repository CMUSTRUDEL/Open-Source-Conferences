Title: Protecting sensitive data in huge datasets: Cloud tools you can use by Felipe Hoffa
Publication date: 2019-03-25
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Cybersecurity
Description: 
	16 March 2019 14:50, Training Room 9-2/9-3

Before releasing a public dataset, practitioners need to thread the needle between utility and protection of individuals. Felipe Hoffa explores how to handle massive public datasets, taking you from theory to real life showcasing newly available tools that help with PII detection and brings concepts like k-anonymity and l-diversity to the practical realm. You’ll also cover options such as removing, masking, and coarsening.

What you’ll learn:

- How to identify PII in massive datasets
- Explore k-anonymity, l-diversity, and related research and options such as removing, masking, and coarsening
- Gain experience with practical demos over massive datasets

first thank you all for being here I'm

00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,899
flew all the way from San Francisco to

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,190
be here so I don't knowwe you flew from

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:15,719
but I see some familiar faces I see some

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:17,940
cloud Google t-shirts my name is Felipe

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,480
Hoffa I've been working at Google for

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,490
the last eight years I started as a

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,939
software engineer and for the last six

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:32,850
I've been a developer advocate do you

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:36,210
know what a developer advocate is yes

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:41,399
or as I call it a software engineer with

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:43,530
a license to speak so I'd love to go

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,570
into conferences I love being on social

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,399
media Stack Overflow you can find in

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,469
many places I'd love analyzing data um I

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,770
love public datasets I've been working

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,840
with public datasets for a long time and

00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,840
every time I give a public data talk

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,409
people start asking me about what about

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,869
privacy what are the risk of sharing so

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,180
much data and that's how I got

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,610
interested in this topic how we can

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,479
protect sensitive data in huge datasets

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,880
or at least how can we measure the risk

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,090
I'm not a lawyer so I cannot tell you

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,040
that fact answers but at least I can

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,400
show you the right tools that as

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,729
engineers we can use not only the tools

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,460
but the ideas behind them so just to

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,340
give you an example I was going to give

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,110
a talk I checked the night before how

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,110
long it will take me to get to that

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,509
venue and it's 20 minutes but turns out

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,240
that the next day when I'm we have to

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:50,100
give this talk now it's more like 30

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,200
minutes 40 minutes fortunately Google

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,509
Maps can predict how long it will take

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,479
for me to go there but the question is

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,909
how can you would you be able to predict

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,509
how long it can take to get anywhere at

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,000
certain time when possible answer is

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,649
using public data sets we don't have

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,420
public data set for every city in the

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,640
world but we recognize this place

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:19,810
the

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:22,750
yes where did I get this map from yeah

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:26,710
no this is not a map at all these are

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:30,310
just points that I plot in the XY place

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,080
and each of these points is one taxi

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,290
trip that people have taken around New

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,470
York so I have a hundred forty million

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,200
taxi trips per year New York the city

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:45,490
publishes this and then I can just take

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,920
all of these points put them theme in a

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,890
chart and whoa suddenly New York shows

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,630
up and especially highlighted here is

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,050
the places where people are taking

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,910
taxicabs in fact that you can see that

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:02,709
the north of Manhattan disappear here

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:05,530
this is not because this place doesn't

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:09,100
exist but if you have that taxi cabs are

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:12,070
not so interested in going there so the

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:15,340
city had to change the law so to have

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:18,580
two types of cars and some cars are not

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,820
allowed to take passengers here they can

00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:27,459
only go to other places and that brings

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:31,239
fairness why is there a light inside

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:33,040
Central Park yeah it's where people are

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,810
taking capsule for example you have

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,820
these super bright spots also in the

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:46,180
airport because people love because they

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:47,890
are straight inside Central Park yes and

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,410
you know so you have a lot of

00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:54,550
interesting data here I just run this

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:58,750
query and I got the data and I was able

00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,250
to scan it and it's super cool other

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,239
things you can do with this public data

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:07,420
this chart is also looking at the time

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:12,850
of the day how many so you can see how

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:15,040
the city breezes and gets more right at

00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,690
certain hours and you can see the

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,060
lengths of the trees and you can see how

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,669
people land on the train station Central

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,520
Station on the morning and start going

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:26,090
everywhere around the city and this

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,850
stuff is really interesting if you see

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,490
blue line this is how many taxi rides

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,130
people are taking per hour basically

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,070
everyone with ha starts waking up at

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,310
5:00 a.m. they pick it's like at 7:00

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:43,310
p.m. and there are no rides there's a

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,940
huge drop at 5:00 p.m. I anyone knows

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:49,120
why shift change

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,120
yes

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,449
so the problem at 5:00 p.m. is that the

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:59,300
law says that no taxi driver can drive a

00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:01,190
taxi for more than 12 hours this is to

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,370
protect passengers this is to protect

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:08,960
taxi drivers and and the law doesn't

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:11,600
tell them when they have to stop working

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,600
but they all decided that the perfect

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,240
time to do this would be 5:00 p.m. so

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,770
they all go home at 5:00 p.m. they

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:24,650
switch cars with another driver and who

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:27,800
loses everyone in the city that wants to

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,050
take a cab at that time and what we can

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,750
see in the red line is they for hire

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,450
vehicles like uber where there is no

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,940
drop at 5:00 p.m. so it's really

00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:41,479
interesting to take public data and to

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,729
make really evident problems that your

00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:47,120
city might be having this is a real

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:50,470
problem in fact this is from 2015 then

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:56,300
if you go to 2016 you can see the uber

00:05:50,470 --> 00:06:00,919
and other for hire vehicles mad start

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:03,889
matching the demand real normal taxes in

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,630
fact 8:00 a.m. when people really need a

00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:09,470
taxi cab at their home

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,630
uber is winning in 2015 and then in 2017

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:16,789
years people are just taking more ubers

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:20,300
and taxes still in 2017 the city has a

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:23,840
taxi problem at 5 p.m. which Buber

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,990
doesn't have I'm just trying to show you

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,210
here the value of having public data how

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,039
it can be really useful for anyone that

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,430
wants to understand how the theory or

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,700
anything else works on the other hand

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:40,169
their risk so when you're publish this

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,029
data set some people

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,550
found out that they could match

00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:46,169
individual rice with famous people just

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,300
by looking at the license plate and

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,550
looking for the baddest for the lines in

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,669
the data set and everyone was super

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:56,099
scared and it was a little there was a

00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:59,810
little controversy and the question here

00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:02,699
is how do we find the balance between

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,830
open data innovation the value that is

00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,879
that I have and the privacy and

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:11,729
protection of people I don't know the

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,680
right answer personally I love open data

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:16,949
and I would love to see regulations or

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,229
how people use it more than what is

00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,419
being allowed to be published but at

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:25,740
least we should be able to measure and

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:28,770
seek out and find out what kind of

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,680
private data we want to share or not so

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:35,639
on one extreme you could just log

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,339
everything out no more access to data no

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,139
more public data but I think it's way

00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:44,460
more important to find the balance and

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:46,830
there is a cure like you can get the

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,370
full value of public data by just

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:53,310
sharing everything or you can protect

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,770
privacy and just not share anything or

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,050
you can find a meaningful balance and

00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:04,279
you buy the identification by

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:06,990
aggregation by creating synthetic data

00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:10,129
we should work in this line and we

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,689
should find a sweet spot for all of us

00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:14,370
so I don't have the answers but I have

00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:17,219
some ideas I have some tools that I can

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:21,270
share with you the projector will stop

00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:24,120
projecting but yeah I happen to work at

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,800
Google you might know this company if

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,089
you don't know it you can Google for it

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,130
and we thank you we have to deal with a

00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:34,050
lot of these products we have products

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,060
with more than many several products

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,979
with more than a billion users we have

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:42,089
to comply with regulations all over the

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:45,269
world and so we need to deal with these

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:47,610
kind of questions and we make the best

00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:48,510
to externalize our best practices and

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,690
tools

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,450
so is there sensitive data in your data

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,959
set

00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:59,440
let's say for example you are building

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:03,040
susie dot AI robot that has to help

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,769
people solve the problems someone has a

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,269
conversation like this with your body hi

00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,579
this is Samantha rubber so and a few

00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:11,320
days ago update my credit card a block

00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:15,579
many critically this number

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,889
please call me back and this phone this

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:20,620
is data we need to solve her problem but

00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:24,430
maybe the rest of our team organization

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,360
the data analyst in our team don't need

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,490
to see all of that

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,139
so the first step with a message like

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:35,709
this is to identify what is PII the name

00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:38,980
a date a critical number a phone number

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:42,459
and then we can decide what do we do

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,199
with it for how do we store it how do we

00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,839
share it within our company how do we

00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:49,480
share it with regulator once we identify

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,370
the names we can replace them by tokens

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,730
we can make dates

00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,290
place a specific we can say this was a

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,600
credit card number but we don't want to

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,100
remember it anymore or for example for a

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,620
phone number we we might want to

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:06,940
remember the first three digits to get

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:11,260
our look some cold location but we can't

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:14,079
forget about the rest and so we have

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:18,630
four we can do partial masking of a

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:22,720
phone number or we could either instead

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:26,350
just encrypt it and if we creative then

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:30,130
we will be able to later get it back by

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:33,160
people that have the recce or another

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:35,410
choice you can make is to do format

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,290
preserving encryption in this case the

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,029
number is encrypted we can get back to

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:44,160
the original number if we have the recce

00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:47,170
but it also looks like a phone number

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,500
for any purpose which is also pretty

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:54,100
cool and it would be great to be able to

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,290
do this operations on the fly same thing

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,810
you have a huge table with data it would

00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:03,190
be great to be able to scan it and to

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:05,690
transform it as needed other techniques

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:08,930
for example are bucketing your data if

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,750
have a survey and you have job title of

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:14,780
each person instead of keeping all of

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,060
the rule are distinctions between a

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,950
junior engineer senior denier you could

00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,080
replace all of these by engineer and

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:26,270
sales with an Operations Manager and

00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:29,120
make your buckets bigger or you could

00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:32,810
also for example do some date mangling

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,860
let's say you have the hospital and you

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:39,770
have a lot of what people have done you

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,570
might want to randomize a date but when

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,510
you randomize the date it's super useful

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:47,900
to also be able to preserve the order so

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:49,820
when a patient you want to preserve the

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,210
order when a patient arrived and when

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:56,840
they left and not go the other way

00:11:53,210 --> 00:12:00,340
around and do all of this operation we

00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:04,210
at Google cloud we made this API public

00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:07,550
which you can use to just make your data

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:10,930
just first scan your data to transform

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:13,490
it and to measure how much risk of

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:16,570
Vietnamization you have in your table so

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,430
let me show you a little bit about it

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,500
first I was telling you it's really

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,540
important to do a classification of

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,580
sensitive data let's look into your

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,420
tables let's look into your files let's

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:32,780
look into your picture sometimes if

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,880
there is an EPA either then you can

00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:38,270
decide to transform this data in many

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,400
different ways you could also go and

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:44,450
analyze and measure there we

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,240
identification risk so every time we at

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,100
first we have data with certain risk we

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,890
can apply certain transformations and

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:55,160
then we can measure again to see how

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:58,790
good our transformations where and then

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:03,170
we can decide in a analytical way where

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:05,180
to stop the identifying the recency

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:09,860
there's a lot of different sensitive

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:13,400
data for example it's really C to say

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,860
that personally PII is sensitive course

00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,830
but also my financial data also my

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:23,290
health data

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:25,720
but you can find data not only in in

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,300
tables can be living files in it

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,910
documents in images and this information

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,839
can come from many places from your

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,070
users from your employees if you are HR

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,029
data that you are sharing with your

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:43,410
partners and all of these needs to be

00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:47,670
accounted for you see any problem here

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:50,700
yes this is an example we are having

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,310
sensitive data credit card number the

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,839
someone can share with you in a picture

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,779
I'm going to skip the video now but it

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,870
is a hold them off how the API is also

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:06,250
able to identify PII in pictures and

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:12,370
redact it and change it for just mask it

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:14,649
if that's what you want to do yes that's

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:19,839
what we use a fact number here but it's

00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:22,480
a number an actual credit card like if I

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,550
try to run this DEP I mean it passes the

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,190
validation if I try to run this demo

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,560
with a totally fake credit card not work

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:34,209
if it passes the credit card validation

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:38,500
the API will redact it if I ask it to

00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:40,510
realize it so yes I will use the API is

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,110
able to mask hash tokenized

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:48,279
do format preserving encryption and you

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:50,649
can use it with calls like this you want

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,520
to make it part of your process this

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:57,339
would be a call where we are asking or

00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,810
roles to be identified in this case by

00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:04,630
with any crypto key that we may decide

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:06,160
and in this case we're asking it for the

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,890
result of the encryption to use the

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:14,440
numeric alphabet for the field employee

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:17,250
ID so if I was going to we create

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,350
reversible tokens for the employee ID I

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:23,380
would take my real numbers and transform

00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:25,510
it in numbers that still look at the

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:30,420
previous ones but now my data is

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:32,829
encrypted say

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,649
before we can do the same with tables

00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:38,980
and do things either in super structural

00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:43,300
data and also in unstructured data to be

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:46,720
committed we have store here the API is

00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:49,120
able to transform to identify many many

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,269
many types of PII from many countries

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,620
but you can also define your own yes by

00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:55,870
defining for example a regular

00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:02,529
expression anything that looks like this

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:07,149
it's pure but not only that um there's

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:09,160
also this field that you can say if if

00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:12,310
something looks like this or it's

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:20,410
possible PII or it's very possible and

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:23,379
for that you can more more grant you

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,720
have the ability to see if what's the

00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:31,540
context for example for example if you

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:34,149
have this pattern and it's close to

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,100
something that looks like medical or

00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:38,709
something like that then you increase

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:42,250
the probability of it being PII and you

00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:44,110
report it as such and it also has

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,639
ability you have ability to create

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,860
dictionaries with millions of entries

00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:51,850
and this is really important for example

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:54,250
ringing in chemical industries where

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,500
they have their own worlds and with

00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:59,410
meaningful entries and their API is

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:04,630
capable of also handling this you have

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:08,589
to give you a short live example let me

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:16,990
show you the tool on demo where I can

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:23,380
say things like hello I'm Felipe Hoffa

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:28,990
and I live in San Francisco my office is

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:38,669
in three four five Speier Street what we

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:38,669
can can we get in real-time with this

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,340
yeah others will I have to check the

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,669
demo so yes you can see it in real time

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:50,059
how it transformed data from it removes

00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:52,679
my name is removed my location

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:57,200
what's address cetera also it would work

00:17:52,679 --> 00:18:03,360
in other languages hola soy Felipe Hoffa

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:06,080
Evo and San Francisco it's somehow

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:11,309
things that hola means a person named

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:17,340
but still if able but but it's still

00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:21,919
able to detect that things are that's

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:25,289
why when it reports Pai it also tells us

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:29,850
if it's possible or very possible like

00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:34,799
you nothing is a hundred percent certain

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:39,030
but it tries it's best ok so this is the

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:42,270
first step we react 25p i we redacted it

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,370
but now we need to decide if we can

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:47,220
polish the thought of it or not there

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,409
are still risk here so we need to have

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,210
three different understand three

00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:54,510
different concepts here when are my

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,400
identifiers may be my name etcetera but

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,909
there are quasi identifiers for example

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,900
my age or the serial live or the zip

00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:03,480
code where I live

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,440
and there's also sensitive data data

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,900
that I may not want you to know about me

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:13,230
once I'm in a public data set maybe you

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:17,270
can identify me yes if you know my age

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:20,429
I'm a zip code and it all depends on

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,820
what are we how much do you know about

00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:25,440
me how much do you know where I live

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,080
there are some measures that people use

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,490
to determine if something is publishable

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,679
or not the formation is going to touch

00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:37,409
today here are gay anonymity al

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:42,299
diversity came map and Delta presence

00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:44,730
anyone is familiar with them for the

00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:47,610
first one yeah ok anonymity is a most

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,549
popular one so for example let's say we

00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:52,340
have this survey

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:56,840
my company's running and we're going to

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:59,720
report my manager how much we like it

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:03,649
each of his employees how much we love

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,929
our manager and we are not going to tell

00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:09,080
him any names we're just going to tell

00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:12,289
him the age and the zip code of each

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:15,169
employee and here you can see that there

00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:18,710
are three people living in the this zip

00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:21,639
code that are 42 year old and they gave

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:25,700
them my manager different fittings and

00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:28,309
we can not tell who gave him a five and

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,909
who were the two that gave him an eighth

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:35,059
their privacy is protected but in this

00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:39,619
table we have for example two people we

00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:42,559
that are 27 here but they both live in

00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:45,590
different places so my manager would be

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,320
able to say oh this is a 27 year old

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,330
that likes me more than the other one so

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,980
if we want to share this kind of data

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:58,519
and we need to look at what do we do it

00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:03,259
here here this is what we call K

00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:07,940
anonymity is how many different roles we

00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:11,809
have with different identifiers so the

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:14,539
guys with 42 have a canine limit of 3

00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:17,149
and the other determined that this table

00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:19,580
has a cane a limit of 1 there's three

00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:23,539
people that I can totally identify by

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:25,879
this 8 and one solution for this to deal

00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:28,749
with Cana limiting one would be to

00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:32,919
delete the three people that have

00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:35,629
totally viral but then we would be

00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:39,259
removing data or we could packet eyes

00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:42,590
instead of reporting the exact age we

00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:45,649
could give a range people between 25 and

00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:48,980
29 and people between 1444 and instead

00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:51,549
of reporting the full zip code we can

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:57,649
report only the first two digits and

00:21:51,549 --> 00:22:00,830
then instead of having then people would

00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:03,170
not be able to Bible you would be able

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:06,110
to draw a cube like this

00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:08,270
that reflects the efficient of how much

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,429
do we bucket eyes shall be do we make

00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:13,880
our buckets so we can still retain

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:16,160
certain information we could have a huge

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,130
bucket that encompasses all of the zip

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,870
codes and all of the ages and then

00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:32,140
everyone is to be protected but the

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:32,140
information is less useful oh yes

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,400
yeah that's a very good comment instead

00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:47,419
of doing age we should use the birth

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:50,000
year instead yes oh yeah I think I don't

00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,799
know whether frame but lobotomy because

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,070
we are going to see some other matrix

00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:58,220
now usually the k-map is one of the more

00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:01,789
sake anonymity is one of the most used

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:04,279
matrix for anonymity a lot of the health

00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:06,380
and science industry as for like at

00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:08,480
least a cane on enmity of five and they

00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:12,470
stopped it there and everyone is happy

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:17,360
but there are more risk that what we can

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:20,809
see here is the zip code and age enough

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:24,020
to reinvent if I someone it depends a

00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:27,320
lot of what table or what data we are

00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:29,840
talking about for example let's say this

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,130
is a different survey and here we have

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,450
people by age we have the zip code and

00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,390
they have we have their product

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:40,549
satisfaction and basically we know that

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:45,710
they live let's say in their town they

00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:48,830
live and their age can we identify which

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:54,590
person in that town replied to the

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:56,929
survey normally the answer is no if I

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,010
told you that someone in bantam that is

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:01,850
twenty years old

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:03,740
gave me a score of five now we are not

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,409
talking about employees anymore now we

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:09,169
are talking about just it is a survey on

00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:12,409
the where we have asked people on the

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:15,559
street yep so the question here is it

00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:19,610
depends it depends a lot on what's the

00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:23,299
zip code what do we know about the zip

00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:26,570
code for came up at least the population

00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:29,149
of each zip code matters so in if in

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,789
Manhattan you have suppose you have

00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:34,279
50,000 people we cannot identify if

00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:37,390
someone was replying to this or not but

00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:42,440
there's out these other zip code 8535

00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:45,049
has only 20 people and then the

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,190
sensitivity depends on the content on

00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:50,440
the context where people living Bravo

00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:54,190
in this zip code with 20 people there's

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,919
only one 42 year old you can go back and

00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,659
identify him and that information is not

00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,799
on the table anymore you need to bring

00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:06,100
external data sets to be able to measure

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:11,460
privacy here and again you can measure

00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:15,850
it let me give you an example with

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:18,870
Mexican birth Mexico publishes all the

00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:22,480
babies that are born every year I took

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:26,169
all the tables between 2018 and 2013

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,110
that's 12 million Bay babies and they

00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:29,740
publish a lot of data for them when they

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,509
were born

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,240
what was the gender of the baby the way

00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:36,190
they hide some health measures like a

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,470
bra and they also published some

00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,649
statistics for the mother what was her

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:44,950
age education have civil status where

00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:47,320
was she born her job

00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,220
so we have a load load load load of data

00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,409
here and we could do some measures

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:56,289
anyone here knows bigquery if I'm going

00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:57,850
to show you before your connection yes

00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:02,259
I'm glad you know bigquery before is a

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:03,340
cloud database data warehouse where you

00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:05,259
can it's fast

00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,019
it's simple work with sequel it can

00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:09,879
analyze as much data as you have it's

00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:12,340
always on it works with your favorite

00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:15,149
tools and you can share data with it

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,830
so I took all of this Mexican tables I

00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:20,139
published them in bigquery and I decided

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,639
that you could look at my table so if

00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:23,350
you want to run queries over them you

00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:26,080
can do so right now

00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:29,860
and everyone has a free terabyte every

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:35,470
month to run queries oh let me run some

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:38,379
queries I have my table here the why not

00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:45,250
let's try to run some queries alive

00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:48,820
I have Mexico birth from 2013 you can

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:53,940
see this table has seven gigabytes of

00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:58,899
data 12 million rows 12 million babies

00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:02,640
we can run some queries over it you have

00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:06,130
a lot of columns a lot of data

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:12,700
for example if I wanted to analyze I

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:14,669
have my query here I have we're already

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,820
here

00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:22,870
where for example in this query I just

00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:25,539
getting for this for each state where

00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:30,179
the mother was born how many babies we

00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:35,650
have so in the Mexico in Mexico City

00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:40,530
we have 1.2 million babies for the

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:44,169
smallest state we have only 3000 babies

00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:46,720
so our statistics the privacy here will

00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:52,240
depend a lot if we are in a big state or

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:55,960
a small state typical Spooner's will

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,210
have more like 40,000 people and we can

00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,120
compute interesting stats like for

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:04,000
example let's get the average weight and

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:11,350
the average cake height of each baby to

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:14,169
see where we get the the fattest and the

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,610
tallest babies and you will be able to

00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:17,530
look at this

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,559
also very very important when you're

00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:23,770
working with public datasets or any data

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,200
set take a look if your data is clean or

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:29,080
not in this case for examples it's

00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,120
really useful to remove all of the

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,870
babies that are smaller than 50

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,429
centimeters and longer than 60 and

00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:40,440
babies are weight less than a kilo

00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:44,590
babies at weight more than 6 kilos you

00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,840
can find a lot of them they will

00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:51,730
probably run data it's just there so you

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:54,909
need to deal with it to show you a table

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:57,220
of this the this is the distribution I

00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:59,140
found for babies you can see that some

00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,179
people some places have the tallest and

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,919
also heaviest babies and these are

00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:07,539
pretty small babies this is interesting

00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,549
again when I show you the citation I

00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:12,880
want to prove that it is valuable to

00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:14,980
publish this we can go and find

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,850
interesting things we can see that for

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,860
this

00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:20,559
these babies are super seen and these

00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:23,309
babies are super fat or while I should

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,169
not patch change the babies but they are

00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:31,390
heavy they're healthier than the others

00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:33,340
and we have 15 minutes left some day I

00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:36,130
have here for example for its babies

00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:39,340
where they were born I could be talking

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:42,400
to someone and I could tell me hey turns

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:45,460
out I was born in this region and you

00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,559
can probably tell their gender maybe you

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,860
can ask them a question so what did your

00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:55,390
mom do what's your mom's occupation and

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,700
was your mom married now what can we do

00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:02,190
with that data

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:08,200
let's take a look and again to the table

00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:11,710
let me run this query with this query

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,530
I'm taking that where the mother was

00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:17,590
born you know where the baby was born

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,510
the marital status of the mother the

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,669
educational of the mother and the gender

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:29,950
of the baby because the mother is a

00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:31,870
female probably and you can see in the

00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,200
big state we have a hundred fifty

00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:38,700
thousand babies that were born for a

00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:43,659
mother that was not married domestic

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:47,710
babies we're May but on the other side

00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:55,510
of this query we have a lot of unique

00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:58,539
people so for example in Yucatan there

00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:01,299
was only one baby born to a separated

00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:06,070
mother with no education and that baby

00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:07,080
was female so here you can identify the

00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,850
baby

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,280
the que anonymity of this tail rule is

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:15,370
one the question is if you are the state

00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,330
if you're publishing this data what do

00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,720
you do about it

00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:25,480
do we remove this item do we bucket I'll

00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:28,020
say it I don't know the right answer I

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:33,690
love having the data public

00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:35,850
but we can tell that the reason a real

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:38,190
identification risk and I could find the

00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:40,860
exact time where you were born and I

00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:47,460
could find a lot of four variables just

00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:58,080
now in these four things so these are my

00:31:47,460 --> 00:32:00,660
results and a good thing about so you

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,370
could rank words like this to measure K

00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,670
nanami to you and to measure different

00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:09,360
privacy risk but with the API I could

00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:19,740
also just pass API to go check my table

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:22,770
you can go and find and report me back

00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:26,910
there results like oh I found this many

00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:30,450
move I found five hundred one hundred

00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:37,440
eighty nine groups that have only five

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:39,960
people with only one unique people and

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,050
then I need to choose well do I report

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,090
all of them or I don't maybe I should

00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:48,090
not report about them but then if I

00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:50,460
remove them if I delete them I'm

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:53,460
removing pretty important data for

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,559
people that live in less populated

00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,860
places and just removing these places

00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:07,470
from the map effect also public policy

00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:10,950
and how much care we take so let's say

00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:14,640
we delete every one that hayasaki

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,890
anonymity in less than five for example

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,309
we have fibers from postgraduate

00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:23,250
divorcees in Villa de Zaragoza

00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:25,410
between these years is it ok to publish

00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:29,670
this data set if we assure that that

00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:34,940
Cana limit is 5 some would say yes

00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:34,940
that's an industry standard but if it ok

00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:43,980
but you're right but yes

00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:46,170
that's an interesting one so the problem

00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:49,700
that I have here is that I go if I go to

00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:52,320
my table and I go find these five women

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,510
the with this characteristic that had a

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,600
baby between these years

00:33:54,510 --> 00:34:02,820
turns out the five of them have

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:06,180
hepatitis B so if you're one of these

00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:10,230
five women I know something positive

00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:15,810
about you okay anonymity did not protect

00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:18,929
them how do I measure this the title

00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:22,020
says it the measure of this is El

00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:23,879
diversity I need to take look for my

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,780
sensitive data where are my sensitive

00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:30,990
columns and ask to also have some

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:35,270
diversity in this column so that means I

00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:35,270
would be to make my group larger even

00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:55,889
anonymity and we were talking about and

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,710
the last thing I was I wanted to talk

00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:04,050
about just very briefly belt oppression

00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:08,310
and this is a different measure that

00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:12,930
takes a look that the problem of just

00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:17,370
having people present in our table so

00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:20,730
let's say we are reporting how many

00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:23,250
people in certain plays have a certain

00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:27,930
characteristic and we say seven people

00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:31,050
in this state have appetite is B to say

00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:33,720
something and it's then it happens that

00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:38,640
only seven people between these ages

00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:40,860
live in that place then yeah you're

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,750
revealing that all of them have this

00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,840
characteristic so that's something else

00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:49,470
that you also could measure that you

00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:51,890
need to have an external data set with

00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,890
that information

00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:59,520
let me go faster with real pain again

00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:02,580
you can measure all of this and I just

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,190
want to show you from an API point of

00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:08,370
view how do we measure these four things

00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:10,740
so for example 4k anonymity I need to

00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:16,590
know what Mary Pacific WA see these are

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:21,720
what it is our location age a birthday

00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:23,700
or instead of age and then I could also

00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,850
have the ability to group things in case

00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:29,310
people are duplicated but basically to

00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:34,470
measure K anonymity I just need to say

00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:37,350
12 API water my capacities to measure L

00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:39,750
diversity I need to tell the API what

00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,820
are my capacities and which ones are my

00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:46,320
sensitive attributes where do I want to

00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:50,820
have diverse and then we came up yes I

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,680
have my positive but I can I should to

00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,930
measure came up I need external

00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,460
databases of how people are distributed

00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:02,190
for Regions we have all of these data

00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:05,730
pre-loaded you just can tell this is the

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:08,490
column that talks about region the DLP

00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,950
will bring the demographic data or I

00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:13,770
could bring my own axillary tables if

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:16,800
the information is not there and same

00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:24,570
with Delta presence basically we have

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:28,260
the same the same the same five minutes

00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:30,620
there's a lot that we have published

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,390
notice something interesting about the

00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:36,420
taxi data set is that as people started

00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:40,460
complaining they the city started

00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:43,590
publishing less data so for example

00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:46,020
first at first we had the exact location

00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:50,490
and we had a hash of the license plate

00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:53,100
of each car on the second iteration they

00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:56,610
deleted the hash of the driver so now we

00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,560
cannot follow individual taxes and what

00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:01,320
are they doing do it the way and that

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,590
affects a lot our ability to find out

00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,600
what would be a good policy to deal with

00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,310
the chief change because we cannot look

00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,750
at

00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:13,910
behavior and now they don't publish

00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:16,220
latitude and longitude anymore now they

00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:19,730
just publish the zone where you took a

00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:22,820
cap so I can draw maps like this anymore

00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:24,890
we just know where people are I have

00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,620
some general area of where people are

00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:29,990
taken ik yes there is pressure to be

00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:36,680
anonymized out of it but they start

00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:38,420
losing their money so for solutions you

00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,670
can provide the courser location you can

00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,130
remove the driver ID you can remove in

00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,890
frequent areas so for example what if we

00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,750
start removing all of these people who

00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:50,450
taking cabs in very non populated places

00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:55,460
that's a good idea because their privacy

00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:57,200
is at risk here but then we would be

00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,060
getting less information about them and

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,310
we wouldn't consider the people for

00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,470
public policies where for people that

00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:06,620
really need transportation because they

00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:10,490
live in remote area and something that

00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:12,740
also the city can do is share the

00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:16,610
detailed data as with certain partners

00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:18,320
and not with the general population we

00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,880
have to do these things like this for

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,560
example when we polish our own data set

00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,280
we have this moving our little example

00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:27,680
data set that we had to identify my

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,410
teammates tell them privacy he publishes

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,420
a lot about privacy and a lot of this

00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:35,000
ideas is one of the engineers that has

00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,320
worked on this API so I would recommend

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,230
you to follow him

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:44,210
he has his Twitter account a lot of

00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:47,210
these things he goes in real depth about

00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:48,940
it I've learned a lot from this post and

00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:53,300
[Music]

00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:57,410
yes and here when I'm trying to try with

00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:59,930
this picture is in the name of privacy

00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:02,360
we could ban public data also in the

00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:04,730
name of security we could ban matches

00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:08,360
but there's a lot of value in having

00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:10,880
them even though they are risky and many

00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:14,540
kids are burned every year so it's all

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,310
about finding the balance and even if

00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,590
you are not dealing with public data you

00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:20,589
still share data in share data with your

00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,920
employer so not everyone in your come

00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:27,219
to look at the full messages you sure

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,519
pal data with her parties partners and

00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:32,849
you have all of these tools in if you're

00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:37,269
doing machine learning that's a huge

00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:41,439
problem tool like how do you what do you

00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:45,459
feed into your public data into your

00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:48,489
models we recently released this tool

00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:50,349
with four different to get differential

00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:52,359
privacy when you're training tensorflow

00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:55,449
it's really cool I didn't talk about

00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:58,959
differential privacy at all way here but

00:40:55,449 --> 00:41:01,900
if you look at a full pipeline of how

00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:03,670
would you create public data set or

00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,709
internal data set before running machine

00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,089
learning first of course you want to

00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:10,869
understand your data so you would need

00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:13,029
to scan for PII redact remove the day

00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:15,189
that you don't BPA that you don't need

00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:20,079
or tokenize it if it would be important

00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:23,920
but not at the granular level you can go

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:29,619
and use tools like tensor flow privacy

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:31,959
to to remove risk but if you only use

00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:35,289
terms of your privacy your models could

00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:37,359
be leaking PII and also your models are

00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:39,549
touching PII even if you use it for your

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,229
privacy you may have to deal with

00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:44,099
regulatory requirements when you still

00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:46,989
want to go through the first three steps

00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:49,660
I talked about some tools today I talked

00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:52,269
about the query data prep escapes deal

00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,130
piece our API and I skip stackdriver

00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:56,140
that would be our tool to just log

00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:59,170
everything and be able to audit what's

00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:00,160
happening how are we doing on time we

00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:03,099
have like one minute left

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,019
let me tell people that this they can

00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:06,459
find me on reddit they can find me on

00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:09,069
Stack Overflow they can find me on

00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:10,660
Twitter and I love love feedback so if

00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:12,910
you like this talk please leave me some

00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,670
feedback and if you didn't like it

00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:18,690
please tell me why you can go to this

00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:23,219
URL so thank you very much

00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,219
