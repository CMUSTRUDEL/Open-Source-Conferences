Description: 
	16 March 2019 11:30, Training Room 9-2/9-3

The Internet is getting a lot bigger. As it keeps getting bigger and bigger, more and more devices are getting interconnected with each other. And its a very important time to talk about IOT security. This talk will be focused on one of the aspects of IOT security, hacking into BLE protocols. Right now Bluetooth low energy is everywhere, your smartwatches, fitness trackers, smart locks and many more. This talk will be a live demonstration on How I hacked a Bluetooth Low energy fitness tracker and send notifications, messages, place a phone call and even could update the firmware over the air!

hey everyone good morning I know it

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,970
started I so really appreciate you all

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,809
being here I can't tell you what a

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,710
pleasure it is to be if I hear that

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,599
means you want to learn more about

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,559
Brittany hacking and hopefully I get to

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,230
answer some of the questions here the

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,730
end of this session but before that I

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,900
want to ask something how is the faucet

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,340
going on in saying it yeah so for me

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,720
it's the first time I met for CJ and

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,000
first time it's Singapore I'm really

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,890
enjoying it so now I hope you're having

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,289
a good time here as well so let's get

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,790
started a quick introduction about me my

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,050
name is Yogi's and I'm from Nepal Hey

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,670
look at the cyber security analyst at

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,110
TCS cybersecurity in in India and I

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,239
spend a lot of time working on IOT and

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,260
mobile application security apart from

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,670
that I love to build and play with

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,649
robots and break them very often and

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,030
today I'm here to talk about Bluetooth

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,210
Low Energy exploitation and how to hack

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,200
them a quick overview of what I'm going

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,489
to speak here today and what can you

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,070
expect from this talk I'll be talking

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,899
about a very basic overview of what

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,920
exactly is legit and what's the

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,719
difference between the Bluetooth classic

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,420
as well as blue as long as he I'm going

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,579
to talk about the ble stat what exactly

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,189
makes the ble after that I'm going to

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,360
speak about what exactly how exactly do

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,490
you do the Bluetooth man the middle

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,990
attack and how how do you sniff the

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,210
tools and hardware used to a sniffing to

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,409
be any packets after that I'm going to

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,490
talk a little bit about reverse

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,830
engineering the mobile application for

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,810
these fitness trackers I made up maybe

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,420
if you have any other smart applications

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,229
like a Bluetooth log or maybe anything

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,850
talking about the reverse engineering of

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,950
that and the end of the day I'm going to

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,630
talk about how exactly uploading the

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,110
former format over these smart devices

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,340
of how your fitness tracker works so

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,329
let's get started first things first

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,130
let's talk about Bluetooth

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,930
trust me it has got nothing to do with

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,659
teeth it's a 1 is taken as a standard

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,180
for exchanging data or voice over the

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,259
distance British the sort a wireless

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,540
communications protocol that allows

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,450
devices such as a smart phones smart

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,310
headset your fitness tracker to transmit

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,040
data and of voice wirelessly it was

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,630
developed somewhere in 1994 at erection

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,790
the standard was devised developed by

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,680
erection is a replacement for cable it

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,119
uses 2.4 gigahertz frequency and creates

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,670
a 10 meter radius called peak on it

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,990
and it has like it has continuous data

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,659
transmission and you know continuous

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,300
data transmission means a lot of power

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,860
uses right so a lot of for many years

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,629
these political applications suffer the

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,440
lane battle a better life just because

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,030
of continuation

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,360
better transmission and transmission and

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,160
lot of power uses until a few years ago

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,390
due to the 4.0 is really the smart came

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,680
into the scene it's basically the power

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,750
efficient version a bluetooth that has

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,010
made many imaging devices possible like

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,440
your fitness tracker your coffeemaker

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,440
your bulbs and medical devices there is

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,420
there are a lot of devices out there you

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,710
name it it's out there this version of

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,970
this model is simply called Bluetooth

00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,830
Low Energy and designed to be power if

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,940
you st. and low cost and that's the

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,410
reason where you can find this ble

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,390
devices for as low as seven to eight

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,920
dollars but here's bill he's an awesome

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,360
technology it enables us to connect to

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,460
everyday things that we thought Dainius

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,350
back would be created to do like suppose

00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,390
10 years back into brick it would be

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,010
crazy to think you're smart like

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,810
connecting your shoes with a mobile

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,130
application right but thanks to ple

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,980
right now a smart shoes are out there in

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,750
the wild and if you see the application

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,340
it's out everywhere your medical device

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,560
ratio is smart home appliances it's

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,420
everywhere but before we move on let me

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,860
draw a clear distinction between the

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,540
Bluetooth what we generally call it with

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,520
classic and the Bluetooth Low Energy

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,630
you breathe it classic is designed for

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,820
product that repairs the continuous

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,250
trimming of data like maybe you head say

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,380
it may be smart speaker that has to do

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,950
the continuous trimming of a music maybe

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,940
anything no it has high power because it

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,130
has to have the continuous data

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,690
transmission it has to has higher power

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,739
consumption right on the other hand we

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,989
have Bluetooth Low Energy

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,900
which is known as barely or maybe a

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,010
little smart a Bluetooth 4.0 this is

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,540
great for products that do not require

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,370
the continuous trimming of data and

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,470
maybe just to send on off to a smart

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,930
bulb or maybe sending your heart rate

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,820
data to you a mobile application right

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,959
the main advantage Abilio with the

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,000
classic is that the ultra low power

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,560
consumption since it's designed to

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,150
operate in the sleep mode and waken up

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,000
only when the connection is initiated

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,590
right like maybe only when light is on

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,350
or off you understand a stateful right

00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,760
so this is useful for those applications

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,239
not only the fitness tracker but now

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,500
many of your iut and smart really just

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,680
because it is simple easy to implement

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,930
and low cost but say that it is not

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,330
perfect it has some flaws almost all the

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,050
time it's discoverable hey it's like hey

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm here

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,620
you send anything and I'm going to spit

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,150
out the information to you and also

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,830
almost all the time it works in the same

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,049
frequency and same same channel always

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,789
and almost at any time it allows any

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,470
device to connect to it and on top of

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,000
that most of the hardware manufacturers

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,760
do not take the benefit of link

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
encryption but there are few devices out

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,530
there like why smart was with implements

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,450
that link layer encryption but at the

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,950
end of the day you can sniff the packets

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,980
but then it would be encrypted

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,060
you can decrypt it anyways but now let's

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,130
go back to the fitness tracker that I

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,450
talked earlier I decided to focus on the

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,010
fitness tracker because it's just that I

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,990
saw many people using that and I thought

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,820
why not hack it and I decided to get

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,480
myself a fitness tracker but not which

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,890
they fit but to hack it but before we

00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,750
move on we need to understand the few

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,240
terminologies that I'm gonna that you

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,620
need to understand in this ble stack if

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,390
you see carefully that two things out

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,620
here the generic attribute profile and

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,210
the generic access profile these are the

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,860
two things that I'm gonna use it very

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,930
often so let's see what exactly are

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,580
these ah let's first talk about generic

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,230
attribute profile a simple gat gat

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,580
defines the way these ble devices

00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,750
communicate with each other with

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,880
something called swabbies and

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,440
characteristic remember these stumps RVs

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,060
and carriages characteristics I'm going

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,370
to use it very often it makes use of

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,840
GATT protocol which is called ATT now

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,430
which in turn is used to show the

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,660
service and characteristic the most

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,669
important thing to keep in mind is that

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,470
gaytan connections the connection side

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,270
is exclusive that means really powerful

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,870
can be only connected to one device at a

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,510
time

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,130
yesterday the peripheral connects to a

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,810
central device it stopped advertising e7

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,880
saying that hey I'm no longer available

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,560
it stops advertising itself and other

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,820
device will no longer be able to connect

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,930
to it as long as the existing connection

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,150
is broken

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,770
so I think that's enough of theory and

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,680
we can finally do some cool stuff let's

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,240
see the very basic process of before

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,500
doing the exploitation of ble device the

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,910
very first step that you want to do is

00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,260
of course getting more information about

00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,100
the device but that there is nothing

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,080
much better than a hardware

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,220
manufacturers manual right any

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,690
specification you would want to read

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,090
them always there are few tools that you

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,010
don't want to miss that's bluesy stack

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,229
at CA 2 and cattles these are the tools

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,690
that anybody uses very often if you want

00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:13,830
to walk and ble we look into these tools

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,030
in the coming slide the next step would

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,830
be to animate the service and

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,630
characteristics either by using the

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,190
tools like ATS a tool or maybe using

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,500
your mobile application if we're gonna

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,820
get more information about the service

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,640
we're going to innovate more information

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,050
about the service and characteristics

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,340
and the next thing would be to reverse

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,110
engineer the mobile application if they

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,220
have any a lot of information could be

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,800
gathered by reverse engineering the

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,960
mobile application many times these

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,280
smart device manufactures forget to

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,169
harden the reverse engineering process

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,590
and many times you would find the entire

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,210
logic

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,410
how these smart applications it smart

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,390
devices connect to your mobile

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,920
application like I was working a couple

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,380
of months back I was working on a

00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,050
smartlock I got it from China so that is

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,310
matlock anything that you'd need to

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,040
unlock that is smart lock without the

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,360
password was there in that was there one

00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,840
see reverse engineer mobile application

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,500
I would be surprised if you didn't find

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,240
anything useful out of that at the end

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,350
of this and the final step would be

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,670
something there doing some really cool

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,840
stuff and hacking the smart lock and

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,280
it's smart well and a fitness tracker

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,110
and uploading the format over the years

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,340
and at the end yes I'm going to talk

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,660
about operating the formula over the

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,990
year and how I was able to operate the

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,160
format over the fitness trackers so we

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,660
step number zero is selecting the target

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,860
these the very first step that you want

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,750
to do you want to find out the Bluetooth

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,610
low-energy devices near you for the

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,500
different Kali or any version of Linux

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,850
distribution you can use at say to you

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,730
might happen to show the blue z-stack

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:34,950
blue sees as simple as a sudo apt-get

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,200
instead of blue Z so once reached of the

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,610
blue see these sa tools etc and gadelle

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,040
comes pre-installed with the blue Z star

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,510
and if you're an Android you can use NS

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,640
panic or if you an iOS you can use light

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,530
blue eye even an RF connect right you

00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,570
can right now go to the police - or you

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,340
absent download these two apps and I

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,260
have panic and I have panic and light

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,450
blue you can eat all these apps right

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,130
now and then you can scan the ble

00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,780
devices all the smart devices near you

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,980
if a device is advertising you must see

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:06,780
there and if you using sa tool if you

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:08,370
want to see how does that works if I do

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,110
it sa tool a scan I'm going to see all

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,480
the devices that are nearby vicinity and

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:16,680
this is how we see all the rivers is

00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,000
nearby me right as you can see all the

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,410
fitness trackers that somebody is using

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,130
mi band 3 all these fitness trackers

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,720
you're gonna saw here

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,220
now we know that device is advertising

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,330
we know it can be connected the next

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,920
step would be to listing down the

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,360
service and characteristic to do this we

00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,770
need to connect our ble device is you

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,770
the Gatton if you want to do it actively

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,310
so yeah you can use this an ionic

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,170
application you can download it from the

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,140
Play Store you can expand all the nearby

00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,340
devices you and then are so stream

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,750
members Yuri selecting the target

00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,490
Eastern number one is animating the

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,510
service and characteristic here we are

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,800
trying to figure out what kind of

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,390
service and characteristic the device is

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,380
running you can do this actively as well

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,790
as passively if you want to do it

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,110
actively then you can connect your

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,430
device to your phone and you can use

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,130
apps like another I've connect to do

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,750
this once you

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,920
it's going to tell you what

00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,020
characteristic and service is running

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,850
super easy or maybe you can use tools

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,040
like cattle on your Calley machine and

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,240
should install me the bluesy start once

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,100
you're connected you can listen all the

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,360
Prime Minister with primary services and

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,460
characteristic using primary care

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,770
district come on you must have UID and

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,260
handle for the service to perform any

00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,940
kind of read or write like reading at

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,470
reading the sensor data and writing the

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,790
sensor data but if you want to do it

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,290
pass if this can be done by sniffing

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,790
someone's connection at the very

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,900
beginning when these smart applications

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,880
connect with the mobile application

00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,010
they're like hey I've got this many

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,250
services and coyote sick and this is how

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:33,070
I advertise myself so now anytime that

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,920
you want to scan all this stuff you can

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:40,870
go to the you can go to here and you can

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,940
do you got - - bu MAC address a few look

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,560
at smart application and then of the - I

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,830
is for interactive so once you do that

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,270
you would be yeah once you do that you

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,490
will be able to list on all the primary

00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,780
characteristic services so at this point

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,400
of time you must be wondering what could

00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,770
be this service and character saying a

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,150
profile actually doesn't exist in ble

00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,410
but is the collection of predefined

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,180
collection of service and characteristic

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,100
so everything town is just a collection

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,470
of characteristics it provides a set of

00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,020
features with associated behave

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,010
behaviors to interact with the

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,750
peripheral like in the fitness tracker

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,400
the device information could be

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,580
something like you know device service

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,390
device service and insert that cactus it

00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,100
could be something like you know

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,560
software revision number hardware

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,050
revision number and could be anything I

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,580
think I hope I made it clear for you and

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,780
now you might be wondering where in the

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,820
planet I would be interested in talking

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,810
about service interesting it is because

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,180
that's the lowest

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,590
main entry point in the ble device that

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,050
you would be interacting with any time

00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:37,120
you do any interaction has to go through

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,200
characteristics now if I have to show

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,120
you the same thing for my fitness

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,860
tracker these are the fields are wish

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,670
that you could observe if you see there

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,800
isn't something called device

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,380
information out there if I expanded the

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,940
device information I could see my former

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,770
number from a revision number I could

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,440
see the software is a number and a lot

00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,810
more to do this I had I use this screen

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,010
studies from a mnemonic you can download

00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,390
it right away from the Play Store and

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,880
you can have light blue in the Apple App

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,800
Store once you're connected you might be

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,360
wondering hey okay I'm connected to the

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,460
ble device but I don't know how things

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,930
works down the packet level easy

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,100
question you'll pick tabs of the packets

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,050
mission that is happening between a

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,910
smartphone and a low-energy device the

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,470
answer to that question is yes if you're

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,990
interested in learning how Bluetooth Low

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,850
Energy works down the packet level uber

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,800
tooth is a perfect choice who do these

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,180
really smart sniffer and by the way it's

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,250
open source as well so if I wondering

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,810
how to capture the packets down to the

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,790
label packet level who would this is a

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,080
solution and you could know how these

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,279
your smart application its might

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,339
applications in a mobile applications

00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,500
are communicating with each other and I

00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:36,910
preferred not to use any sniffers at all

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,860
because sniffers do drop a lot of

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,850
packets and if somebody who like me who

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,100
doesn't want to spend any money on

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,779
sniffers there's all 21 Android phones

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,360
so what I do is if there is an app

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:47,649
available in the Android I do install

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,060
that and then after that I let it

00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,790
communicate with it but we show that

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,649
there is if you go to your device about

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,850
settings you could find a something

00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,230
called build number if you tap the build

00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,060
number five times you would enable the

00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,890
developer option once you enable the

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,380
developer option you could go to this

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,940
setting called enable bluetooth sh snoop

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,529
lock once you enable that any

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,270
communication that is happening between

00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:08,890
between your smart application and your

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,740
mobile application would we log there

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,480
and you can transfer this log file to

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,240
your computer and you can open it up in

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,370
voice arc it's super easy

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,900
now since I have you IDs and

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,130
characterstic I got services I was super

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,900
excited to send the notification and my

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,130
fitness tracker I wanted to prank my

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,900
friends saying that hey Trump is calling

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,430
you right but you went bad whatever I do

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,380
the fitness tracker was getting

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,730
disconnected in every thirty seconds it

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,110
was because I was missing out something

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,209
really important that was authentication

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,100
now not every devices would have

00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:37,660
authentication in for the ble devices

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,730
not every devices that I have worked has

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,130
authentication like the one I talked

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,660
only a hat was a smart ball the Haro

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,029
manufacturer thought it would be super

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,650
cool and super interesting not into the

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,320
authentication and they thought it would

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,970
be super cool too late your neighbor

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,770
next door to turn on or off your light

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,510
right so they didn't have any

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,339
authentication then I happen to read the

00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,350
article by Android thanks to Android by

00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:01,240
the way which is written very well how

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,370
this device is fitness tracker and it's

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,140
smart ble applications do authenticate

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,209
with the mobile application I'm not

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,010
going to go in depth about this how this

00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,630
is working because I already have

00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,760
written I already have working process

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,430
here you can me-me-me you may feel free

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,630
to take the pictures if you want to go

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,860
if you want to know more about this you

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,270
can reverse engineer the mobile

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,440
application for this fitness tracker or

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:25,810
maybe you can go to this link medium.com

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,209
it's the link you can go there you can

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,980
and then what I did was once I had

00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,750
authentication I was connected my I

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,990
connected my BL implication to really

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,579
fitness tracker to my computer and once

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,019
I did that I wanted to send send

00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:39,670
something really cool notification I

00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:41,860
remember I told you something about an

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,690
elf connect right so this is a log from

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,620
the NRF connect so the beauty of this

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,910
and I've connect is that any

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,320
communication that is happening you

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,699
could see what exactly the values are

00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,139
being sent and you could always reverse

00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:51,910
engineer that and find out what exactly

00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:54,070
is happening so you can restart writing

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,839
python scripts to do this authentication

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,029
there's a library called blue pipe which

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,389
enables you to communicate yo Python

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:03,100
applications with your smart devices I

00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,570
don't care what application or what

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,699
language that you use but all you need

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,560
to do is send your data to the service

00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:10,420
and characteristics that's what I we

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,889
need to do using the unafonica you can

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,300
you see the logs is basically used to

00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,300
see what is happening behind the scene

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,709
as you can see here the this particular

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,240
values one I send some particular

00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,310
notification this particular values were

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,449
being sent to the some characteristics

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,120
if you should the cat is nicknamed the

00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:26,290
last folk visits by 3 4 MB so to this

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,480
particular characteristic there was some

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,680
valid at waving sent and when I started

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,089
doing the revisiting I found or

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,130
something really cool the first to

00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:35,860
notify ste bytes or was the notification

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,480
type like the geo one is for email geo

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,800
three for call if you want to defend

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,420
prank your friends saying that hey

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,000
somebody's calling you you could use

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,440
these values to send them and the next

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,410
to bite is the number of notification

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,940
that you understand and the last few

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,980
last hex bytes but the notification

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,779
types and notification match that you

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,339
are trying to send the consent preach

00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:56,079
means anything like me a call

00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,819
notification and your smart notification

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,519
in whatnot so this was a simple Python

00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:03,459
script that I wrote many of you would be

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,110
a Python fan here so just go to my

00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,149
github github.com /uk shows that the

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,850
whole tool is out there and how I was

00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:12,639
able to hack his fitness trackers if we

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,370
see here the last three lines I'm

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,420
writing some value to that particular

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,920
characteristics if you remember a long

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,779
time back I told you we're going to do

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,250
any sort of communication that is we're

00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:22,600
going to do to the smart devices is

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,819
going to happen through this particular

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,110
characteristics by a lot of things you

00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:27,790
could do you could even reciate the date

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,000
and time you could send any SMS

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,380
notification a lot more and if we see

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,610
here I was able to send any call

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,170
notification to the smart was

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,649
needing to toss it physically this is

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:42,619
just an example in the next thing that I

00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:44,149
wanted to do is I so many people using

00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:46,069
the fitness tracker and I thought when

00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:47,929
it put the sky like into the fitness

00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:49,429
trackers right since I saw many people

00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:51,709
using that and I thought it would be

00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:53,480
super fun and super cool to do that so I

00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,679
started focusing in the former so the

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,290
next question was where do I get the

00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,910
format right and I told you so let's

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,529
talk about the format first so formal is

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,829
a piece of software that runs on an

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:06,799
embedded CPU there's literally i this ce

00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:08,660
sudanese en is compiled to run on the

00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,660
embedded devices and transferred either

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,670
by a programmer are you using any wire

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,040
tools so the next question is like how

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,959
do I get the formal one option could be

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,850
engineering the mobile applications if

00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:22,699
they have any or else you could capture

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:26,029
this DF you could capture the format

00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:27,319
during the DfE of data so what I think

00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,720
was if you wanted to do the reverse

00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,519
engineering bathing tool in Cali are any

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,619
words in of Lin of station that you

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:39,259
could use and then after that you cool

00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:41,209
smart application if you do you would be

00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,619
able to see all the like D compiled

00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,079
version of that ap can you could see a

00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:46,610
lot of information out there and you

00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:48,169
could see here once I did the revisions

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,179
I think I found out who important file

00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:52,639
said that was uh fw file and are yes

00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,959
well the reason why I was why I started

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,669
doing the revision inning is because

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,369
when I was disconnected to my fitness

00:16:55,669 --> 00:17:00,259
track and I do something wrong the

00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:01,399
fitness tracker would update even though

00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:03,139
if I'm not going to do that you know net

00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,789
the finish tracker was uploading with

00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:06,049
the official application so I thought

00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:07,189
maybe they should have something inside

00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:08,630
that so once you go to the asset

00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:10,250
directory once you decompile the

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,809
application there are a lot of folders

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,010
one among them which you really want to

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:14,720
look is I said directly so I said

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,279
Ricky's gonna have all the farmers all

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,230
the resources and all this stuff so I

00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,699
found these files and once you find this

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,819
files you can pretty much change almost

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:24,949
anything and once you make any sense

00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:27,529
into a form way you have the hunt for

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,120
the former upload service and I started

00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:30,440
hunting for the from former upload

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,120
service because I had to operate the for

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,620
my to some characteristics right if you

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,809
remember I had mentioned a powerful tool

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,880
called an F connect that allows you to

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:39,230
scan and explore your low energy devices

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,149
anybody communicate with them so I used

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,549
an F connect to look for the device for

00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:45,770
my uploads or DFU many Haro

00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:47,140
manufactures they have D written live

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,210
but then many times

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,010
she accepts her expectation versus

00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,170
reality comes in a lot of times it's

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,300
going to be all unknown services unknown

00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,100
services but another day if like if you

00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,600
if you know how to use Google anyway

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,320
Google is a basement to do all certain

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,270
things just do the Google search you

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,910
could find but exactly the DfE service

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,440
so they could be many services with the

00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,880
unknown services and it could be really

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,200
difficult for you to find out you can

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,180
use Google for that and then you can

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,220
find out what exactly characteristic is

00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,900
using to do the DfE operated device

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,730
firmware update and the next thing is

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,170
how do I put the format right when I

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,730
reverse engineer mobile application I

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,290
found out they accept in the four bytes

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,630
train it's like initialize the format

00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:28,210
and up in the five bytes for resources

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,500
so if you can ascend something on from

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,480
word like suppose if you want to change

00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,920
device name your software visit number

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,850
or whatever that's gonna be in the

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,350
format but if you wanted to change

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,450
something images although stuff it's

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,360
going to be in the ratios its it first

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,160
sense but 0 1 is the first byte saying

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,440
that hey after this file with this

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,970
particular file size so once you have

00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,560
these features you could append 0 to it

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,030
the end to notify the updates have you

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,160
saying that you are starting to send the

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,020
resource another format I have written

00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,280
the detail is steps on how these former

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,390
upload books I am not only spend much

00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,890
time and this you may feel free to take

00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,240
the picture and maybe we could go to

00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,440
medium become sliced yogi says I have

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,540
written it over there so I'm going to

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,560
move into something really important now

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,930
once you operate the form where your

00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,100
device could be waiting for section this

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,690
is really important you need to know

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,920
what exactly it's section because when I

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,990
was hacking through this fitness tracker

00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,700
I spent a lot of time not knowing what

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,920
exactly section what I did was I sent

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,500
the form where it was until 99% is and

00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,760
after that I was a stock it was me it

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,750
was not except in the form it is because

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,520
I was missing or something really

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,410
important the restriction let's see what

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,490
exactly it section or section is a

00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,540
calculated value that is used to

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,910
determine the integrity of the data

00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,800
doing the transmission over the wireless

00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,960
so that the man the middle attack

00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,040
doesn't happen section swaps is a unique

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,990
identifier for the data that is

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,640
transmitted if the data it says so does

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,110
the section value as well this makes it

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,090
super easy to verify the integrity of

00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,180
the data today say data integrity the

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:45,100
sender since the Senate calculates the

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,900
you know section for the data that is

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,340
being signed in it does calculate

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,200
section as well now the sender Singh

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,360
sends that section as well as the data

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,890
to is really the data to the receivers

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,570
saying that hey this is a section AB

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,330
guard is it the same thing with you as

00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,580
well now if this section value matches

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,060
with the high degree of confidence the

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,190
data is

00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,930
reishi bees proper and the smart device

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,490
is going to accept the former if it take

00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,290
some message then the former ratio is

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,300
accepted really doesn't perform the

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,940
error correction but it can only perform

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,900
the idiot detection and good 5.0

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,030
introduces the error correction as well

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,500
now there are several types of checksums

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,450
available in Bluetooth but didn't

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,100
particularly uses CRC cyclic order in

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,150
physics in this fitness tracker that I

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:27,280
worked with it was using CSA 16 section

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,200
so now if you see here I was able to

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,580
change this is not a proof of concept

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,990
when I was able to change the device

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:36,250
name it's very the soft revision number

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:40,630
if we just place my dog by the way so I

00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,920
could have minded 9.9 this morning I

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,810
found out that when the version number

00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,020
it says you no longer can feel your

00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:48,730
smart fitness tracker with you mobile

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,860
application because the like suppose if

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:58,270
right now it's running version 3.2.2

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:59,590
ipad @ may be that particular

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,120
application already has the latest

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:04,510
version and I need not about that

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,370
so what's cool what smoke cool than that

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,050
so I remember I told you about this call

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,390
I can write again this is a proof of

00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,680
concept you could expect more than this

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,970
if you should be school I can hear ya

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,040
this is how I was able to operate this

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,990
call I can yeah this whole social

00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,060
critics then in the github from word I

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,500
would over the object is really cool

00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,270
feature that's found nearly on all the

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,800
embedded devices I demonstrated on how

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,350
this feature could be exploited to our

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,000
attack us to inject malicious from where

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,620
modification into the devices the

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,200
problem is that habit manufacturers do

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,060
not graphically sign the former in the

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,290
system now include the authentication

00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,270
freezing the device that could recognize

00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:40,120
if the former is signed by the vendor

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,680
I think it did vendor then literally

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,180
accept the former from anyone the

00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,100
solution for that for this could be

00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,380
cryptographically signing the former if

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,640
the implement security amazes again the

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,290
cost of the device is going to be up

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,870
high but they have to sell a lot of

00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,970
device right so many smart device

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,710
manufacturers like fitness tracker or

00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,710
maybe a Bluetooth lock do avoid this

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,660
just to reduce down the cost so I'm at

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,410
the end of the talk does anybody has any

00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,410
