Description: 
	The Open Vision Computer is a fully open source smart camera especially tailored for UAV applications and used in the past in the DARPA FLA program. The OVC 3 is the newest revision and includes three global shutter image sensors, two monochrome for stereo and one RGB for recognition, as well as an IMU and expansion capabilities for up to 11 cameras in parallel. It also runs Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS natively. The talk will introduce the architecture and capabilities of OVC for people who might want to use it and customize it for their application.
