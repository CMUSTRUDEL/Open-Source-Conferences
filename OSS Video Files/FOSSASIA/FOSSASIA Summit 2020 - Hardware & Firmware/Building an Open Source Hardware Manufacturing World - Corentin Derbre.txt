	00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:08,250
all right let's start so building an

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:12,690
open-source hardware manufacturing world

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,370
it's a quite a catchy title I think we

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,460
are built we are building this project

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:22,789
we've been building this project for

00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:27,390
about five years and we are nowhere near

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:30,720
finishing at all so let's go through

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,260
where we're at and I'll welcome any

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:39,120
questions at the end so first of all Who

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:42,239
am I I'm a game developer for PC that's

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,260
what I do most of the time I've also

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:50,100
worked in fab labs in France which is

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:57,600
where I'm from and now I'm also building

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:59,190
maker net org with with a team and I've

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,620
been active in open source hardware

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,199
since I read the culture books because

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,530
this seems to me like the most plausible

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,650
and desirable future we could go on for

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:14,340
Humanity and as I am a game developer

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,770
you will see very nice sci-fi pictures

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,490
throughout the whole the whole

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,920
presentation but we are very serious

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:27,360
about what we are building and it's just

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:30,479
to give a sense of bigger picture which

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,360
I think building anything without having

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,340
a bigger picture in mind is not really

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,869
worth I mean as a research why not but I

00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:44,700
also believe that the best way to

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:48,990
predict the future is to build it and so

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:52,770
the first the first picture on the right

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,170
is my future house and garden open

00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:00,960
source of course which I will invite all

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:04,200
of you to join when it's built ok so I'm

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,149
not alone in building this there is a

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Andrew lamp from field-ready

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,990
and PR excessive aldini which is who is

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:17,970
my co-founder at McCarney org as

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:25,710
as a lot of other people who help us and

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:29,100
also challenges we a quick thanks to the

00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:32,370
shuttleworth foundation standards repo

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,590
the CERN open open hardware license feel

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,180
ready of course and that's all systems

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:41,970
for their funding hosting advising

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:47,750
connecting sharing and all other helps

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:53,040
they provide us so with the summary of

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:55,380
this presentation we are building a

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,490
marketplace for open source hardware

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,920
manufacturing

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:05,520
this is microRNA org we are also

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,610
developing a lot of open standards some

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,990
of them are called open know-how which

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,260
you can find on the website open

00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:18,420
know-how org and open nowhere which

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,340
doesn't have a website yet and I will

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:26,160
also invite you to join us by uploading

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:28,530
your designs to sell them so let's start

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,300
with explaining of it what maker net dot

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:35,310
org is we want to build an open-source

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,650
hardware manufacturing world and for

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,840
that we think that the designers as well

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,540
as the manufacturers should be paid and

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:49,080
I we don't see open-source hardware as

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:53,010
not being equal to getting paid wait too

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,840
many too many conditions in this

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,220
sentence so well we think we think

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,430
people should get paid for their work

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:04,680
and being open source is not getting in

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:08,130
the way of that so the website is is a

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,070
big assembly of a lot of things together

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,260
three type of people in there one we

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,250
have designers who will build the

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,410
blueprints that designs the files and

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:23,280
update them and this is hosted on a git

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:26,060
repository we have manufacturers who

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,000
will receive manufacturing orders

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:33,520
and we have clients like people who

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,810
browse Amazon or lazada or whatever

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:46,120
marketplace you can find a line to make

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:49,060
all of this work we want to have as much

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,240
to include as much as we can so we have

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,700
we are using Dassault Systemes

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,690
spatial library which allows to convert

00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:03,440
between all 3d file formats and 2d as

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:06,830
well so the library is not free but it's

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,979
we make it free of use on the website so

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,780
anybody can use it and there's no no

00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:14,180
payment required anything we think this

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,400
is a very important piece of making

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,470
everything work is that there's an

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,200
interchange entertain change ability

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,729
between all all the file formats that

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,370
people are used to we don't want to

00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:30,650
impose things on people we want to

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:32,510
include as much as we can and another

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:36,500
the last part is the storefront like

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:38,539
Amazon so this is where we are barely

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,539
getting into that so we have a very

00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:50,590
rough one it works but I think this is a

00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:53,810
yet another huge thing to to manage and

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:57,860
one one quick thing before before I

00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:02,030
continue so we're we're doing that maker

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,639
net is a company so for-profit open-open

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:09,050
know-how and open aware our nonprofit

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,330
things and we do not think that we have

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,820
the right answers what what we are

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,830
trying to do is to find them so if we

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,660
are wrong of or if another company is

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,150
doing a better job than us we'll be very

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:25,880
happy because our end goal once again is

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:28,280
to build a world not to make just a

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,350
single website better than the rest

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,690
although if we achieve our our goals it

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,110
should be better should provide more

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,150
value

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:45,120
and a more resilient way of

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:47,790
manufacturing and having yeah having a

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,660
new world we'll go into the into the

00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:53,040
details of what benefits this open

00:06:51,660 --> 00:07:01,260
source hardware manufacturing world

00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:05,250
brings so then the open standards that

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:09,420
we need to make this marketplace work

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:12,530
and we're also perfectly fine with other

00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:15,450
marketplaces using these standards and

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:20,780
some are actually we are collaborating

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:28,350
for example with wiki factory to build

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:31,610
these standards so we want to have a

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,230
standard for step by step industry

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:40,770
standard a standard open Hardware

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:43,770
recipes to be able to in the future make

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:47,730
them machine readable as well as human

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:50,910
readable we want to have a standard for

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:53,460
contracts and we'll see later an example

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:58,380
of why it's not as easy as it seems

00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:00,360
because we want to we want people not to

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,850
worry about contracts while having full

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,090
transparency and also the power let's

00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:09,990
say you place an order for a thousand

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,910
pieces and the workload is divided among

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,090
many manufacturers we want the contract

00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:20,820
to handle that not the person who orders

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:22,830
and of course the last but very very

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,020
important and we are barely scratching

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,870
the surface its quality control all of

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:31,110
this does not make any sense if what is

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,800
manufactured does not it's not reliable

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:39,090
and it's not up to the expectations of

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,690
the buyer by the way the three parties I

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:46,260
mentioned manufacturer designer and

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,270
buyers they could be any two or three at

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,670
the same time

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,850
there is no separation is just a

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:58,610
separation in where you're right on the

00:08:52,850 --> 00:09:01,310
website then we have open databases this

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,950
is open or open nowhere we want to have

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:08,900
maps of machines and tools around the

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:11,210
world and and this this needs to be open

00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,670
because it is it is something that will

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:18,310
never be complete and needs to be

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:20,720
updated all the time and I don't see why

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,150
we should not make it available to

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,350
everybody and everybody can take part of

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:29,720
it in it we also need to have skills and

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:33,800
people this would come as a second time

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:37,750
it's not vital to make things work but

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:41,480
it will be vital because the more we

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:44,480
computerize the more we can do later and

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm sure once this database is start

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:52,190
growing we'll see a lot of unexpected

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,830
uses of them and of course we need a

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,380
material SATA base because the

00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,720
manufacturing world we are suggesting is

00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,390
also very good at doing local

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,100
manufacturing and let's say you want you

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:08,150
how to have your designer chair from

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:13,070
Italy but you live in Japan and you'd

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:18,500
rather have local wood used we need to

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:21,710
make sure that the woods match in terms

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,170
of physical properties otherwise you

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:26,720
wouldn't really get the same quality of

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,520
a chair and I'm talking about less

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,260
visual qualities and more about just

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,030
making sure the product works as

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,530
intended

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:38,060
of course the example of a chair is a

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:39,730
very straightforward one but the same

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:45,050
the same can be thought of for

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:47,300
electronics or it's more intricate and

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,980
complex pcs that are assembled some

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,440
parts could be replaced and we need to

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,440
know where how

00:10:55,089 --> 00:11:04,970
so now I I can pretty much think that a

00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:08,270
lot of a lot of you might think it is an

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,890
ambitious project yes it is and the

00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,350
thing that is nice is that it's already

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:16,000
working it's at a tiny tiny tiny scale

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:20,350
but we have all all the required

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,350
elements of the chain to make it work

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,149
we are currently having a little trouble

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,950
with our payment providers but we are

00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:36,440
just switching we were using PayPal and

00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:41,660
we have to change so let's go through

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:44,000
the benefits for the designers I think

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,450
from speaking with a lot of designers

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,160
they're first they're worried about not

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,310
getting paid because they associate

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,500
open-source hardware with many fallacies

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,750
they think it's for learning they think

00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,350
it's you do that as a hobby and you

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,120
deliver it to the community or you don't

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,980
finish a project so you just put it on

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,450
open and you see what happens

00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,910
and never do they think that they can be

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:16,670
paid or even make more money by going

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:19,940
open meaning releasing their their

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:23,110
blueprints to everyone and they're under

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:29,570
any license but we recommend the CERN

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:32,240
open hardware license and they would

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:34,670
benefit from improved design designs by

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,690
a global collaboration exactly like what

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:41,570
we see in the software world I think the

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,970
only reason why open hardware hasn't

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:49,180
picked up is the ease of use and the

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:53,029
speed of iteration of modifying and

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,940
manufacturing hardware in software you

00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:58,610
can just download things run it I mean

00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,890
it's a matter of seconds hardware is a

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,900
little bit slower so it's and there are

00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,390
many more tools

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,830
less standards because it involves more

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:10,940
steps you need to get out of the

00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:13,070
computer involve many skill sets but we

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:18,620
are clearly seeing a trend toward

00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:20,839
simplification I can just just in on top

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,850
of my mind I'm thinking of the Sketchup

00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,790
software I mean it's so easy that

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:29,360
anybody can use it and I think it's

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,520
important to think of speed and ease of

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,050
use

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:39,290
so more people can take part then we

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:43,670
have manufacturers the thing is that

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:46,640
manufacturers in the way we are thinking

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:51,760
things would be like uber drivers they

00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:58,910
would get jobs sent to them and they can

00:13:51,760 --> 00:14:04,160
decide to take them or not and this this

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:07,850
also scales to more more things like

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,670
we've been talking with with an airplane

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,660
company in located in France I cannot

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:16,700
disclose which why this but there they

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,390
have recently bought a lot of small

00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,279
manufacturers around the world and what

00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,779
they intend to do is to unify these

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:28,430
small manufacturers around the world as

00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:30,529
a big manufacturer controlled online so

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,300
this is another thing that could could

00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:38,029
be considered a benefit it's quite far

00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:44,510
away I think to be something real but

00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:48,440
it's to keep an eye on as I think the

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:51,110
future will be much more distributed and

00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:55,610
we'll see less like huge chains who

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:59,120
repeat the same motion or it's not it's

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,470
not like a hundred percent it's will see

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,610
a transition and it will be like a

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:07,430
gradient more more smaller manufacturers

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,540
in addition to do to the ones that are

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,540
quite big and mass-produce

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:16,410
then the benefits for customers I think

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:20,070
this is the most obvious one this is

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:24,120
what I what I got from reading the

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:27,740
culture books we have we want to have

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:32,639
locally built on demand customized

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,980
repairable products because if if you

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,529
think of it why not have the products

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:42,029
that you exactly want instead of what

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:44,339
the market offers you we're not there

00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:49,410
yet of course these are all future

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:54,449
wishes the customized part can be can be

00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:56,339
done but yeah so it's a lot of it's a

00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:58,019
lot of tiny pieces that change

00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:02,269
completely the way we think of it and I

00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:05,730
think once we have most of it in place

00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:08,370
we'll find it hard to go back to having

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,130
standardized products and one other

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:13,110
thing that that is very important is

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:17,190
full transparent manufacturing

00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:21,540
information so on the on the right this

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:25,880
is this is a just a label that we would

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:28,410
make per product generated automatically

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,510
because we have all the information from

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:36,540
the open standards and the open data

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:38,820
basis we can exactly like Nutrition

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,570
Facts you know the US Nutrition Facts

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,490
sticker I think it's very important to

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,670
display the same on hardware this way

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:50,300
you know where the money goes

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:54,360
you know what materials it's made of and

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,790
you have ideally this QR code who would

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,199
link you to through all the informations

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:02,069
of the build when it was built

00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:04,919
who built what following what version of

00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:06,809
the plan so if you want to repair just a

00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,079
part of a machine you know which version

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:12,150
it was you know you can have access to a

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,179
file as it's a git repository so you

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,699
have the full history you have the

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,790
license you have everything so this this

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,230
is just a dummy product it doesn't

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,230
doesn't make any sense but we would also

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,459
have this

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:29,350
cute picture I think it's important to

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,820
to make it look interesting and to

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:39,239
appeal to people to look at this

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:42,609
information so why are we building this

00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:48,759
the main reason is to promote knowledge

00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:55,090
sharing we think that knowledge sharing

00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:56,859
in hardware is is not sufficient

00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,019
compared to what we can see in software

00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:02,859
I've mentioned why hardware is slower

00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:05,889
but I think we can see a trend in more

00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:09,039
and more sharing of hardware and it's

00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:14,139
important to develop better hardware

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,970
because software relies on hardware we

00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:18,519
want to make collaboration easy for

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,710
hardware all the most of the designers

00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,350
we talk to there have no standards they

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:26,529
still name their files version one final

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:29,830
final one final two they use Google

00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:32,080
drive's or Dropbox which is okay it

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,989
works it's not bad and we also will you

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,720
can also import Google Drive into maker

00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,340
net in in a few clicks because we want

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,350
to make it easy for people we don't want

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,909
to impose new ways of working that are

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:47,950
that don't make sense

00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:49,690
so collaboration is very important we

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,489
want to make it easy to manufacture and

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,429
sell products the story of my

00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:57,190
co-founders that he was designing an

00:18:54,429 --> 00:19:01,239
adaptation to a 3d printer and he wanted

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:05,039
to to sell this improvement he made but

00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:08,739
then he had to go through the hassle of

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,600
incorporating understanding tax laws how

00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:13,179
to sell in different countries how to

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,710
contact manufacturers so as a beginner

00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:21,309
in the in the hardware world you get a

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:26,649
lot more barriers to entry then again

00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:29,409
software and again we don't see why in

00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:30,879
the future it shouldn't be as easy they

00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:32,529
were it will never it will never be the

00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,899
same software and hardware will never be

00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:36,810
the same but hardware could learn a lot

00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:39,400
from

00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:43,630
from where software has been anything

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,700
it's a great inspiration transparency in

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,600
the production chain as I said I think

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,600
this is important as well

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,560
databases for people skills machines

00:19:51,790 --> 00:20:00,610
tools and materials having you know in

00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,380
if you start if you start to learn about

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,910
anything I think you have to measure it

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,250
you have at some point to start

00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,990
measuring it and you cannot measuring

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:12,040
measure it if you don't have the right

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:16,060
units and all these databases are and

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,560
standards are units of measurement and

00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,630
once we can measure things we can

00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,690
improve things otherwise you are just

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:26,200
aiming in a dark and hoping that you get

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:30,340
better and also customized products so

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:33,750
for the end users I'm again talking

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,810
talking using an furniture example but

00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:39,610
you can think of much more advanced but

00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,500
did you ever like you have a new place

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:47,230
you want a table that is exactly this

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:49,390
length and you go to whatever store and

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,340
it's not exact so then you have a small

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:55,720
gap or it's slightly too big or you have

00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,840
to adjust and there's not there's no

00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,690
real reason why the future could not

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,910
provide you with exactly what you need

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:07,860
again furniture simple example but you

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:10,030
can apply that to many more things and

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,920
yes because we think it's how

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:16,720
manufacturing should be I think where

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:21,930
manufacturing is at right now is just a

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:24,420
side effect of where society has been an

00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:27,280
understanding like this global

00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:31,420
connecting everything then I'm not going

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:35,200
into into into globalization and stuff

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:37,900
like that but we see trends in in the

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,250
u.s. in Europe to go back to local

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:45,340
smaller things let's let's talk let's

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,179
take a small example that is related to

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,030
the virus

00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:53,540
in France there there are only two

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:58,070
factories who are able to produce masks

00:21:53,540 --> 00:22:02,240
and they ran out in the first weeks they

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:06,429
sent them all to China so France is

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,750
relying on other countries to get masks

00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:11,030
although they have manufacturers in

00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,700
France but not enough so I think this is

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:19,190
a clear example where the government's

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:24,340
and and and the states are seeing that

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:27,590
there is a lot of weakness and a lot of

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:30,320
vulnerability in having everything

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,169
manufactured in one place and also we

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,440
see a loss a clear loss of knowledge in

00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:38,059
I mean I'm talking for the countries

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,700
that I know the US and Europe but I

00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:44,720
think it's the same everywhere and they

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,460
also realized that the economy of the

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,500
country still relies heavily on

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:54,110
manufacture for the US I think it's been

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,340
going down and I think a lot of I forgot

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,860
the name of an institute who later

00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:01,429
research and this and they were showing

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:04,210
that decreasing manufacturer locally

00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:07,820
weakens the whole economy because of

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,559
relying on other countries so at some

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,620
point you become at the mercy of what

00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:18,260
happens somewhere else and you just

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:23,809
respond instead of initiate then let's

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:24,730
go through a simple example a very

00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:28,309
simple

00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:30,400
so there we let's take a designer who

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:33,470
uploads yet

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,299
question or you're the designer okay we

00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,309
have a designer there so he applauds the

00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:43,130
design I'm going with furniture again

00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:45,860
five minutes five minutes okay he sets

00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:50,260
he builds he builds the blueprints for a

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:54,620
new chair he uploads the chair on line

00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,630
under the CERN license and he sets a

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,830
designer fee so for every chair that

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:04,830
will be sold he will get

00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:07,690
one hundred US dollars for example then

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:09,399
this design must be built at least once

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,809
to validate it this is this is where

00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:15,669
we're at we're welcoming any suggestions

00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:17,320
or improvement as well of course but so

00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:19,600
the design has to be built at least once

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,840
so we know it's something that can be

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:27,659
built maybe in the future there will be

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:30,429
ways to simulate and skip this step then

00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:36,129
this this build the designer can keep it

00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:38,860
it's not kept as a stock somewhere we

00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:41,529
just now are able we are now able to

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,240
list the product on the marketplace so

00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:45,700
you clients will just browse the

00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,279
marketplace see the chair and they can

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,610
order let's say they order 20 of these

00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:54,490
chairs for their huge house and let's

00:24:51,610 --> 00:25:00,820
say the designer is in Singapore and the

00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:03,999
client is in Canada so we will match the

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:06,820
order with a manufacturer who's whose

00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:08,700
skills match what is required and the

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,730
local manufacturer all manufacturers

00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:14,799
received the order and built them once

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:18,070
the quality is approved the

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,850
manufacturers send the product to the

00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,850
client and

00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:29,680
the money that the client put online to

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,660
buy these is distributed to the designer

00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,620
and a manufacturer of course actually

00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:39,490
the manufacturer get get paid it's paid

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:43,930
before building so he's able to get the

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:46,720
materials here's a here's a use case

00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:50,140
that we that we did in Iraq with feel

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,020
ready to have 3d printed animals in soap

00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:56,740
to incentivize children to wash their

00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:58,450
hands and this is one of the examples of

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,250
one-to-many contracts here at the

00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,430
challenge is having a contract between

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:06,310
one buyer which is feel ready and many

00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:09,250
small manufacturers who have just have a

00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,740
3d printer and know how to make soap

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:15,700
which is very basic you just melt soap

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,890
that already exists and there is no

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,640
there's no easy solution to have this

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:24,550
one too many contract so this is one of

00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,090
the things where we we work to make it

00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,090
easy

00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:33,070
again the summary exactly the same slide

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,840
as earlier but as a recap we have a

00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:38,230
marketplace for open source hardware

00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:42,430
manufacturing maker net org we have open

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:45,840
standards open know-how org and open

00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:49,330
nowhere which will be built shortly and

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,560
I want to invite you to join us by

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:57,030
uploading your designs and sell them or

00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,030
take part in developing the standards

00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,570
that's all

00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:07,110
[Applause]

00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,639
thank you that is fascinating I have at

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,669
least half a dozen of my own questions

00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:14,070
obviously in Florida I will yield to

00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:15,120
everybody else's first but before I do

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,740
that I would point out that

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,019
unfortunately sign up a bit late and

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,850
we've actually now run into the break

00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:23,700
and so if people want to take a tea

00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:26,909
break at this moment it's there's 15

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:31,799
minutes left so I was sort of hanging up

00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:34,620
for that so think I invite questions but

00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:45,620
those have to break it we go now Harish

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:45,620
yep too

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:52,059
we are so what please please repeat the

00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:54,340
question yes so how many people have

00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:56,890
gone through the process and what type

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,110
of products so we two people have been

00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,970
through the process one is us of course

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:05,020
to test what we built and the other is

00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:08,380
field-ready the type of products are

00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:11,860
very simple we only do 3d printing laser

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:15,000
cutting and CNC like the basics that you

00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:18,309
can find in fab labs because we rely on

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,660
the most distributed manufacturers we

00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:21,730
can find our fab labs and they usually

00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:24,760
have these three pieces of equipment so

00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:26,679
we already have a network of a thousand

00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,260
plus small manufacturers around the

00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,450
world this is our test case and if we

00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:36,790
make it work with that I think we can

00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:40,150
start thinking bigger so it's usually

00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:46,179
like one step processes and we haven't

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:50,830
gone into electronics or computer stuff

00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:53,350
yet you mentioned the CERN open hardware

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,640
license in fact that's three licenses do

00:28:53,350 --> 00:29:00,610
you mean any of the three or do you mean

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:03,220
one in particular CERN or oh it el 2.1 I

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,770
think now yeah or 2.0 he's that's three

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:08,140
licenses okay

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:11,309
they are cold hang on so you've got a

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,929
boss the page its degrees of

00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:17,590
permittivity strongly reciprocal we

00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:20,650
preserve low and permissive so no GLS so

00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:22,480
and we shall W answer no hlp yep so on

00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,250
the website is actually like on github

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,140
you can choose which license when you

00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,620
start a repository and you can change so

00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:31,929
the guy here is Andrew cats he's the

00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:35,290
person who wrote these licenses and

00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:38,470
we've been talking with him to to make

00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:41,200
sure we're not experts in licensing so

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,929
we wanted to have his opinion if things

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,990
match if there's a problem with us being

00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:49,809
a company or how how does it work if the

00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,190
blueprints get out and everything seems

00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:53,169
to be in order we are perfectly okay

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,770
with having people getting all the

00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:59,100
design all the designs out of maker net

00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:04,140
as long as they follow the the licensing

00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:07,530
which is just keep the trail of who and

00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:11,210
what improvements have been made and

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:13,920
what you've talked about designer fees

00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:16,590
so yes in an open context isn't that

00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,990
somewhat voluntary sorry isn't that

00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,790
somewhat voluntary what's what what

00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:24,330
prevents another design I simply picking

00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:29,340
it up and making a derived work

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:33,510
available yes there's no easy answer for

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:40,200
that I think that's the risks of doing

00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:44,220
open things so we would not in the

00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,990
future we would not I don't know it

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:50,840
honestly I don't know we would try to

00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:53,610
avoid files that are that are copies

00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:57,929
compute in terms of computation we can

00:30:53,610 --> 00:31:00,120
easily check that other than that yes

00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:03,150
it's a challenge and we I think we rely

00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,790
on human honesty and intelligence which

00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,170
might be a flaw in the design I think

00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,610
everything just try it and see what

00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,809
works what doesn't because branding

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,330
nothing becomes part of it you can

00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:14,400
certainly readily require that licensees

00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,350
get licenses to the design but not to

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,070
the use of any branding and this is more

00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:22,170
or less what goes on with high-end

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,450
textile manufacture where the knockoffs

00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,740
are not just similar they made in the

00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,929
same factories but the same people using

00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,050
the same materials the same tools

00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:30,720
off-shift

00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,100
yep there isn't a difference but they do

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,330
you think you know into a banding thing

00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,590
so it it's not really limited to open

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:40,470
open-source hardware it's actually

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,870
already the case at least high-end

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:49,200
branded stuff any other questions in the

00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:50,940
room I wanna ask one more of my long

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,620
list you mentioned of the culture books

00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,120
but the any of the talk is part of the

00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,010
rest now but don't haven't identified

00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,120
what they are sorry you give us some

00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:00,860
more information about what those books

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,760
are these Ducks the titles authors

00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:08,559
through my for the authors

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:12,490
I earn em banks he's Scottish I think

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:15,760
he's dead now sadly there were no

00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:18,370
adaptation of his books on TV or cinema

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,889
but I think it should arrive quite soon

00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,320
as they are great he wrote at least a

00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:25,750
dozen of the culture books I haven't

00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:30,039
read them all and it's it's a

00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:32,440
super-advanced future where humans I

00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:37,809
mean they're it's not clear if they come

00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:41,500
from Earth or not but they they do yeah

00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:43,570
they're human but yep so it's super

00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:47,860
advanced and you have a eyes everywhere

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:49,630
humans are enhanced to a point where

00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:52,480
they can basically do whatever they like

00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:53,529
and there's no risk and no this death

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,299
threat

00:32:53,529 --> 00:33:03,220
and they can have anything they want at

00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:05,470
any time provided by these super AIS and

00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:09,309
some of them are ships spaceships and

00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:14,620
they're very funny in a you know quite

00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:18,990
in a British way of funny cool I just

00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:23,409
wanted to identify the matter yeah we he

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:25,179
calls it culture series but yes you're

00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:29,070
right I could have provided more

00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:29,070
