00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,769
we're ready to kick off the audio video

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:18,119

to this year's open tech summit so

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,580
really welcome to everyone so I'd like

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:35,280
to just ask yourselves to give yourself

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,750
a round of applause good there'll be a

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,730
bit of applauding because we've got a

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,550
kind of the formalities to get started

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,710
this morning we're meeting again this

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,140
year to celebrate the progress in open

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,440
source software right the growing

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,170
support was the community the project's

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,390
been able to build stronger networks and

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,219
for yourselves to meet peers and

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,770
like-minded individuals right so that's

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,780
why we're gathering again for for Asia

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,790
2019 the future is false that is the

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,189
slogan for this year's theme around the

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,260
maturing of Foss and it gives

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,650
credibility to the growing adoption of

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,170
open source you get to learn a lot in

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,270
the next few days interact with great

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,259

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,439
participate share ask questions and

00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:28,110
network with your fellow attendees so

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,920
today we can reflect on an eventful last

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:35,700
12 months since Foss Asia 2018 I think

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,720
IBM bought Red Hat OSI is celebrating 20

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,630
years of open source Linux reached 25

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,530
years of open source and also released

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,790

recently f5 bought nginx and if anybody

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:03,299
has a guess as to how much I was for so

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,350
650 million and so what we're seeing is

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,479
a lot of money and a lot of support

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,259
