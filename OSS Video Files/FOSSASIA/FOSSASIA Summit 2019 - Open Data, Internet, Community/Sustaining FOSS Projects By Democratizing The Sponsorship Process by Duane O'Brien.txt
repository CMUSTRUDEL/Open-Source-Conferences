Title: Sustaining FOSS Projects By Democratizing The Sponsorship Process by Duane O'Brien
Publication date: 2019-03-22
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Open Data, Internet, Community
Description: 
	15 March 2019 14:30, Event Hall 2-2 (Hack Stage)

Within a given company, there are typically only a few people involved in deciding which FOSS projects and initiatives to support financially. This year we decided to change all that and democratize the decision making process. We set up an internal FOSS Sustainability Fund, and invited everyone to participate in the process. This talk will examine how we got executive buy in for the fund, how the fund was set up, how we encouraged participation, and what the impact has been so far.

Oh duan i will just head over to you and

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,529
i see you in the same colors it's the

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,610
opening screen it's almost like it was

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:14,670
on purpose that I match the slides yes

00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,960
so this is really great and we would

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,410
like to here with you like how you

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,109
engage in false projects and like we are

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,330
recording it because if I was already

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,310
thinking when I read your proposal we

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,810
should share this with all the companies

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,490
who come here to the 4th Asia Summit and

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,769
supporting it because I think it's

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,719
really great way what I read and looking

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,090
forward to hear more about sustaining

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,550
false projects by democratizing the

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,680
sponsorship process yeah thank you very

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,710
much for joining us drawn great thank

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,710
you

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,780
ok so I want to apologize very briefly

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,270
this is my first time to Foss Asia so my

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,270
first time to Singapore I'd like to get

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,149
an understanding of who's in the room so

00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,879
students in the room how many students

00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:01,350
probably more than half how many people

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,890
who currently work in software

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,930
engineering ok great and how many people

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,970
make open source contributions as part

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,030
of your work Wow

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,189
ok quite a lot so the context for the

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,130
talk that I'm about to give has a lot to

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,290
do with working in a company where you

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,830
are trying to get more people involved

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,330
in contributing to open source there is

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,119
a thing that can happen when you make

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,670
that transition from being a student to

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,979
being a full-time employee where work

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,450
can consume a lot of the engineering

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,509
time that you have and you find yourself

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,900
slowly contributing less and less to

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,700
open source overtime if if you find

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,500
yourself at that point in your career I

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,479
hope you'll remember back to this talk

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,100
and become the open source and free

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,100
software advocates that your company

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,079
needs in that moment so my name is

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,420
Dwayne O'Brien I work at indeed calm

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,840
feel free to take pictures videos write

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,790
blog posts tweet at me come up and ask

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,530
questions later come down and meet the

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,390
us at the booth there's half a dozen

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,740
folks from indeed we're pretty easy to

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,759
spot we're either all wearing orange

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,869
jumpsuits or in the indeed shirts so

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,230
about me

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,080
I started off kind of as a

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,970
a parole guy on the Java team that kept

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,129
servers running we didn't call it DevOps

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,680
at the time I was just you know that guy

00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:23,989
who knew Perl after that I moved on to

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,959
JavaScript and did a not a very good job

00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:29,900
of writing javascript code for a while I

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,799
then was working with Adobe while they

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,470
were going through their agile

00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:35,299
transformation I was there during their

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,400
transition to Creative Cloud and the

00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:39,349
things that came along with that and

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,180
after that I was working in the

00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:43,519
open-source program office at PayPal

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,440
before I took the job I have now as the

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,500
head of open source at indeed so I am

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,660
responsible for sponsorship decisions

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,459
I'm responsible for designing and

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,829
driving initiatives and programs that

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,660
get people involved as well as helping

00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:58,879
indeed release good open source projects

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,310
and basically anything that people have

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,989
a question one for open source they come

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,420
to the open source program office for

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:08,930
answers and my future life I'd like to

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,970
be something between a rock star vampire

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,950
wizard and robot I don't know what that

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,459
looks like I might have to craft that

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:21,500
role for myself so I joined indeed in

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:24,260
late 2017 and the annual budget for 2018

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,930
for the open source program was already

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,290
decided when I joined the company and

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,269
they had earmarked several sponsorships

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,310
that they knew they wanted to make the

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:36,169
Apache Software Foundation the open

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,359
source initiative the Python Software

00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:40,250
Foundation the cloud native computing

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,530
foundation they knew that they wanted to

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:46,700
have a large boost sponsorship at OSCON

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:48,560
and there was also $10,000 set aside to

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,630
go to webpack which is a technology that

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,970
was extensively used that is still

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,220
extensively used at my request we also

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,359
got in contributions to outreach e

00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,629
anyone familiar with the outreach e

00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:01,430
program one person okay I have lots to

00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,090
tell you about it but it's off topic on

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,459
here

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,079
they give paid sponsorships for people

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,980
to make their first contributions into

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,660
open source I want to focus though on

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,569
the webpack sponsorship because if you

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,549
look at everything else here there's

00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,590
initiatives and foundations and a

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:21,769
conference and then one single piece of

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:24,020
software and I asked how we got the

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,159
point how we got to the point that we

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,010
were sponsoring this one piece of

00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:27,630
software

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,900
and the story went something like this

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,460
the leader of our front-end Court team

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,500
says to my boss we should give money to

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,050
webpack and my boss said I think this is

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,490
a fantastic idea and then it just

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,400
happened right there was money set aside

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,840
in the budget to give to webpack now it

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,710
was a little bit more behind the scenes

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,350
but not a whole lot now the way

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,900
sponsorship decisions supposedly work is

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,610
the program head defines a budget and

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,580
says here's how much I money I think I

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,960
need to run our program and then the

00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,280
program had selected some strategic

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,070
sponsorships and things that they think

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,340
are gonna move their program forward and

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,840
then every quarter or so you sign the

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,550
sponsorships that are designed to hit on

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,170
that quarter and then there's world

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,790
peace everybody gets the sponsorship

00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,370
money and everybody's happy with how

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,450
everything goes that's how it's supposed

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,960
to work but that's not how it actually

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,700
works

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,240
how it actually works is the program

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,800
head requests some budget and then get

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,620
that out there and then you get an

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,420
adjusted budget back so it's always

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,840
adjusted down it's never adjusted up you

00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,670
asked for $10,000 you'll get $8,000 or

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,990
something like that and then you take

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,370
the money that you have and you figure

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,750
out where you think you want it to go

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,660
see you earmark it for certain

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,860
sponsorships and then if you're me and

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,170
I'm looking at my team members here

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,970
January 1st hits and you get all these

00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,560
crazy new ideas of things that you want

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,450
to decide to do at the last minute so

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,300
not Michael's laughing cuz he does the

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,980
same thing you have all these new ideas

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,750
of different things that you want to try

00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,070
and you're kind of rearranging your

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,690
priorities and while you're doing that

00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,190
some senior folks elsewhere in the

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,780
organization come and make

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,850
recommendations of their own hey we

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,260
should show up at at this conference or

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,940
why aren't we sponsoring this initiative

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,530
and then there's a series of high-level

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,690
discussions between everyone involved

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,430
and then those people have reasonable

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,980
disagreements about where things should

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,930
go and at the end of the process you

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,280
wind up with a compromise right half

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,110
happy there's some people who are very

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,700
happy with how it went some people who

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,080
are kind of sad about how it went and

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,300
some people in the middle who got a

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,220
little bit of what they wanted now

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,900
nothing really inherently wrong with

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,520
that it's kind of how the sponsorship

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,390
decision-making process has been going

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,440
all along except for everything the

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,420
first thing is that these high-level

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,280
discussions are really exclusive if

00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,869
these are the people who are making the

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,339
decision about where sponsorship go

00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:43,649
that's not what the company looks like

00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,599
all right they have direct reports those

00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:47,669
direct reports run teams those teams

00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:49,529
have team leads and engineers and

00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,969
designers and marketeers

00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:52,409
and people all throughout the

00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:54,929
organization who were not involved in

00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:57,029
this process in any way right so it's an

00:06:54,929 --> 00:07:01,169
exclusive kind of decision-making

00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:02,969
process and because it's exclusive the

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,459
decisions are very seldom transparent

00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:08,069
unless you go through the explicit step

00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,139
of saying hey everybody here's the

00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,899
sponsorship that we signed here's why we

00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,339
signed it most people that are further

00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,289
down in the organization don't know why

00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,679
any of this is happening they just know

00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:23,879
that it happens which comes into if they

00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:25,679
want to raise their own voice on things

00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,629
that they think should be sponsored they

00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,999
have to escalate those kinds of requests

00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:31,529
and that's easy if you sit you know one

00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:34,139
or two rows down for the decision making

00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:36,059
process but if you're a designer way

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,139
down in the org who thinks there's

00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:38,669
something really important that we

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,169
should be sponsoring you've got to

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:43,769
escalate your request through seven

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:45,269
layers of people and it's competing for

00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:50,039
information is competing for attention

00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:51,719
with a lot of other things so we decided

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,629
to try something new it indeed this year

00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:56,309
to hopefully address some of these and

00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:58,110
this is called the Foss contributor fund

00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:00,419
and I'm gonna break down during the rest

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,239
of the talk what it is how we run it and

00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,189
what we've learned from it so far so the

00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:07,409
false contributor fund is a pool of

00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:09,689
money that is in the budget for the open

00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:11,789
source program office that is unrelated

00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:14,129
to organizational sponsorships or

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:16,619
conference sponsorships so sponsorships

00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,319
like Foss Asia come out of you know one

00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:22,739
side of the money there's a second pool

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,989
of money set aside just for this and we

00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:26,879
will sponsor software projects out of

00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:29,459
that pool of money those projects are

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,559
nominated by employees so anyone who is

00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,870
engaged with the open source program has

00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:35,339
the capability to come and say hey we

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,189
should be sponsoring this because it's

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,930
important to indeed those projects do

00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:41,279
have to meet certain selection criteria

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,790
and I'll talk about what those are in a

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,439
little bit and then can anyone who makes

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,660
an open-source contribution over the

00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:51,389
course of a given month gets to decide

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,070
and cast a vote on where that month's

00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:54,150
allocation should go so

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,220
everybody who made some kind of

00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,840
open-source contribution in January they

00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,940
got to decide on where the funds for

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,610
January went and that allocation is

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,370
$10,000 a month so every month indeed

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,830
gives $10,000 to an open-source project

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,380
that meets certain selection criteria

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,020
the first one is it has to use an OSI

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,100
approved license it has to have an

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,070
open-source license ones that it is

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,070
recognized as an open-source license it

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,020
must be used by an Indian deed so it has

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,670
it doesn't have to be in our product

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,930
stack it doesn't have to be in our

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,390
infrastructure but it has to be

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,850
somewhere the example I always give is

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,680
the imaging software that IT uses to

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,150
provision new laptops to new employees

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,210
when they come in if that's open source

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,400
it qualifies we use it at indeed so we

00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,500
have to use it has to be OSI approved

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,360
license it must not be owned in a by an

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,340
employee I'm sorry you can't nominate

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,860
the project that you wrote if you work

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:50,400
at indeed to receive $10,000 that's kind

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,710
of cheating and finally they have to

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,150
have some way to receive funds they have

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,680
to have an open collective they have to

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,360
have a patreon and they have to have a

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,010
foundation that can receive money for

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,990
them just some way for us to give the

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,520
money it can be a PayPal button it

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,710
doesn't really matter the thing that

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,060
matters is our procurement department

00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,070
the people who actually write the checks

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:12,810
have to be able to get money into the

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:14,700
into their hands now the fund has a few

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,970
different goals obviously we want to

00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,980
support and sustain our dependencies but

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,570
the secondary goal and really a primary

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,240
goal of mine is if we want to drive open

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,650
source participation with an indeed they

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,170
were saying he was saying at the

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,060
beginning there were 700 participants in

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:35,040
the code he'd hackathon that's great

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:37,260
right I my personal long-term goal kind

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,600
of for everyone is that after something

00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,640
like a hackathon they will continue to

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,620
make those contributions down the line I

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,230
want the same thing for people who work

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,670
at indeed we want two more people to be

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,800
involved we want people more people to

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,900
be involved regularly in contributing to

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,000
open source we also want to highlight

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,770
projects that are important to everyone

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,420
in the company so not just the ones that

00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,250
the senior leaders might think are

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,900
important are the ones that I think are

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,540
important because I have visibility into

00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,100
certain parts of the organization I want

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,560
anybody in the organization to have the

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,740
ability to say this is important

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,050
we use this everywhere and we need to be

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:15,160
supporting it and any company of any

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,480
given size you know there's going to be

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,389
hundreds and thousands of open-source

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,860
dependencies that your company relies on

00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:27,259
I could probably name 10 to 20 off the

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,029
top of my head for indeed if you wanted

00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,769
to say like hey what are the top 50

00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:32,329
things that you use I got to go to

00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:35,209
software that's gonna pull that out for

00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:37,550
me there are thousands of things that we

00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:40,279
use right and there's only so many that

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,540
I can know at any point so giving

00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:43,160
everybody and the ability to highlight

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,559
projects that are important we also

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,629
wanted to try something new in the

00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,220
open-source sustainability space there's

00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:52,009
been a lot of conversation ever since

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,899
heartbleed about open-source

00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:56,139
sustainability what it means trying to

00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:59,930
help maintain projects addressing a

00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:02,350
maintainer burnout and so on we talked

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,850
to a lot of people who are involved in

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,680
sponsorship in particular and

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,990
open-source sponsorship this is not an

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,129
approach that other people are taking so

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,809
we think it's new and interesting and we

00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,250
wanted to see what happened and what

00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:15,769
happened is there are several things

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,139
that could go possibly wrong money might

00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:20,389
be the wrong thing for a project not all

00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:23,120
projects and know what to do with money

00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:25,399
if you show up and not all projects want

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,089
or need money I talked to someone who

00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,470
maintains a very popular project and

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:32,449
money was not his problem what he needed

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,889
was someone to be a product manager for

00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:36,649
him because he didn't have the ability

00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:37,759
to interact with users so money might be

00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:39,019
the wrong thing for the project maybe

00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,709
they need infrastructure or something

00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:44,449
else if we put it out to a vote voting

00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:47,209
might select a problematic project a

00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:48,680
project that has a very toxic person

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:50,480
running it or that has some other

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,339
problem with the project that indeed

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,040
would not want to be associated with for

00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:57,769
one reason or another our process might

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,910
break down we might set up a thing and

00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:00,860
have a vision for where things are gonna

00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,079
go and then our processes might come

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,420
apart at the last minute we also might

00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,069
need to curate nominations depending on

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,829
how many people nominate projects if

00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:11,870
there's six or ten put forward and

00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:14,360
you're gonna vote on that that's easy if

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:16,040
people nominate 50 projects you need to

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,879
vote on your favorite that starts to get

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,930
hard right and so none of these feel

00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,930
unsolvable

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:28,660
they're just things that could go wrong

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:31,459
now in order to actually get the fund

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:34,069
implemented I had to get an executive

00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:35,540
buy-in I had to get my boss to agree to

00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:36,860
give me a hundred and twenty thousand

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,600
dollars to give away to open source

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,550
projects over the course of the year

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,519
using this thing that nobody else had

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,899
tried and so I want to talk a little bit

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,420
about getting executive buy-in for me a

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:50,569
little bit like this I wrote him a

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:53,029
document and I said I do long don't if

00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:56,509
you don't want to read it I $120,000 for

00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:59,089
a sustainability fund and now underneath

00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,990
this there was a paragraph I'm asking

00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:03,079
for a budget of one hundred and twenty

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,550
thousand dollars allocated in 2019 for

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:06,079
distribution to open source projects

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,449
which indeed consumes and then that goes

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,519
on to explain sort of the approximate

00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:12,769
idea we had for how voting would work

00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,550
and everything and Jack's response was I

00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,689
think this is a fantastic idea and

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,040
sounded familiar to me because it was

00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,319
pretty much the same thing he said two

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,040
webpack it was there was a little more

00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:27,740
involved in this but I lucked out in

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,540
that I worked for a boss who really

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,569
understands what it means to give back

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,040
to free and open source software but the

00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:35,209
big learning here I think for everyone

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,480
if you ever find yourself in this

00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:39,560
position is always ask if I hadn't asked

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,130
he never would have had the opportunity

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,990
to say yes and I went back and forth on

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:49,790
that hundred and twenty thousand dollar

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:52,160
number many many times it was 60 it was

00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,339
ten it was 12 how how much money do I

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,290
want to ask for 120 thousand dollars was

00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:58,850
the most I wanted to ask for I asked for

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,970
it I gave him the opportunity to say yes

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,709
and he did so always ask you'll never

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,800
you you'll be surprised at what can

00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:08,870
happen now let's talk about measuring

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,910
success for the program if we come back

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,800
to the goals of the initiative the thing

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,509
that I really want to focus on is this

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,779
driving open source participation within

00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:20,990
indeed for people who work in corporate

00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:23,269
open source program offices metrics is a

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,209
big conversation right because you

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:28,100
always have to be thinking about how you

00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,540
can demonstrate that your program is

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,819
doing the things that you want it to do

00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,889
and so there's lots of ways that you can

00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:34,250
measure open source participation there

00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,600
are good

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,090
things to measure there are bad things

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,160
to measure I'll stay out of most of the

00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,930
conversation I want to talk about what

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,840
we landed on which was this idea of

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,070
active recurring participants so active

00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,870
means that they have triggered some kind

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,430
of an event that we care about it's not

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,520
just that we know what their github ID

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,560
is it's that they've done something in

00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,510
within the time frame that we care about

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,310
recurring we're looking for two or more

00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,500
days of activity within a given window

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,060
we measure this currently quarterly so

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,500
we're looking for someone to be making a

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,970
couple of different open source

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,060
contributions over the course of a

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,650
quarter in the Linux kernel community

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,750
that might be a significant amount of

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,280
activity and in the JavaScript community

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,480
that might sound like what they did for

00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,150
lunch it just kind of depends on what

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,470
your ecosystem is what but a couple of

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,190
different days in the quarter that's

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,890
what we're looking for

00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,110
and participation is a broad category of

00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,270
events it is not just measuring code

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,340
contributions right it is filing issues

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:30,530
it is doing code review it is doing

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,810
triage it is participating in the

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,220
broader set of activities that we know

00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,680
go in to maintaining an open-source

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,030
project so this is the thing that we

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,620
settled on to measure this is the thing

00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,420
that we want to grow and this is the

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,000
thing that we believe will tell us if

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,590
we're making a difference so we've been

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,930
running it since January let's talk

00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,100
about what we've learned so far

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,840
January was our first month and in

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,770
January contributions went up hooray

00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,510
graph goes up into the right how far up

00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,400
so I'll break this down very briefly

00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,900
this was October this was the first

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,450
month that we were actually measuring

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,850
any kind of contribution activity and we

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,760
were promoting participation in October

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:10,280
fest this is November in America giant

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,560
holiday huge law we didn't actually do

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,940
any promotion of anything and so we saw

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,290
a significant drop in contribution

00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:20,030
activity in December we were encouraging

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,100
participation and something called 24

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,990
pull requests we saw a nice jump in

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,700
activity again and this is January the

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,580
best month ever as far as contributions

00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,140
go we had 20 projects that were

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,200
nominated to receive funds from the

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,640
Faust contributor fund that was more

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,810
than I thought there would be but that

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,720
wasn't the thing that really got me

00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:41,420
excited ten of those projects I knew

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,430
about I probably would have listed you

00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,140
know as things that we were using five

00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,780
of those projects I'd heard of I didn't

00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,520
know we were using it indeed

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,980
five of them were completely unknown I

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,020
had never heard of them right they were

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,060
open-source projects that were in you

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,190
said indeed that someone thought were

00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,350
important enough for us to support that

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,940
they nominated them to receive $10,000

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,370
and I'd never even heard of the project

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,670
now that shouldn't be terribly

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:08,320
surprising I there's only so much actual

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,670
open-source software that you can you

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,680
can know about in any given time but

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,850
this really excited me because this was

00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,230
one of the things we were looking for

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,330
people to nominate projects that were

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,640
important to them not just to a senior

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:21,790
leadership as far as our participation

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,010
numbers those went up as well so we had

00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:26,410
as far participants was about 12 percent

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:29,170
higher than the three-month average

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,960
previously just slightly fewer

00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,130
participants that we had in October but

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,900
significantly more than we had in

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,070
December so we did see a nice jump in

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,100
people who were active recurring

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:41,710
participants like I said about 12% over

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,940
the previous three months average and

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,900
the project that they voted to support

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:49,240
was Jango it's used a lot to roll out

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,820
products and use a lot in our incubator

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,540
so let's go into February and February

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:57,700
contributions went down a bit so this is

00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,950
February contributions lower than

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,170
January higher than December so they

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,550
dropped a bit and I would expect to see

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,720
that as a new initiative kind of

00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,450
exciting and then a little dip at the

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,250
end but we only had six nominated

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,560
projects which was really interesting

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,410
and in fact three of those were carried

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,670
forward from January and so we were kind

00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,960
of scratching our heads about this one a

00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,000
little bit what we did learn something

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,750
from it and I'll cover that in a moment

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,400
as far as participation goes

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,510
participation was actually down we were

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,690
eight percent lower than the previous

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:30,130
three months it was not quite as bad as

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,990
November when we had that significant

00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,680
dip it was so higher than that but well

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:37,350
below October in January but what's

00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,340
interesting is we had fewer participants

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,240
but the second-highest month of

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,260
contributions that's kind of interesting

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,560
and I'll come back to that in a second

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:50,200
so in that in February the money was

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,850
given to get so get well which is run by

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,890
software if we managed by software

00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,960
freedom Conservancy we'll be receiving a

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,700
$10,000 donation what we learned out of

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,220
February first of all was that promotion

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,580
matters in January we were pushing a lot

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,140
of that

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,730
information about hey there's this new

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,890
thing you need to come participate in

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:08,440
February we didn't do any of that and so

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,250
we definitely saw a drop in and

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,960
participation

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,820
we also learned our nomination process

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,130
is unclear when we went and talked to

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,929
previous participants they said wait I

00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,100
have to nominate them again I didn't

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:21,760
think I had to do that I'm not gonna do

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,350
that now in my mind just having to go

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,940
nominate a project and that was just

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,010
filling out a Google form that takes

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,390
maybe 10 seconds that was the minimum

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,620
amount of interest someone needed to

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,260
show in order for this to be an

00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,340
interesting that they wanted to pursue

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,539
but that's not how the community

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,120
received it that's not now had they

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:38,799
viewed it so the nomination process was

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,330
unclear and hey our process can

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,710
breakdown it wasn't so much that we

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,000
decided not to put out slides in

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,769
February it just kind of fell through

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,240
the cracks on us so we're working to

00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:49,059
implement processes that keep it from

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,980
happening and we left with this question

00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:52,570
our average contributions going up we

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,370
had more contributions fewer

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,860
contributors that's interesting and

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,380
maybe something we should keep an eye on

00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,399
so in March March contributions I don't

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,669
know yet we're only halfway through

00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:06,370
March this slide was a couple of days

00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:10,019
ago so it was missing some information

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:12,250
when I put the information in we had

00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,990
slightly fewer contributors than we did

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,149
at this point in January but more

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,440
contributions per contributor which is

00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,419
another thing that makes me wonder our

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,519
average number of contributions per

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:24,700
person going up I don't know but let's

00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,110
keep an eye on it over time so where do

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,950
we go from here what are my plans and

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:32,110
dreams for Foss contributor fund first

00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,659
off we'll be releasing a CC license to

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,460
blueprint document I had wanted to do it

00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:38,049
in March but I didn't feel like we had

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,880
enough data to really provide a good

00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,830
blueprint so we're targeting July for

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,389
the release of a document that any

00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,309
company could follow that anybody could

00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:47,230
follow to implement something like a

00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:50,490
Fosca tribute er fund and their own

00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:53,500
company in their own in their own place

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:55,000
what comes after this is I really want

00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:59,139
us to focus on growing those

00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,450
participants into maintainer x' now the

00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:03,220
sustainability conversation a lot of the

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,330
people try to solve the problem by

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,100
putting money at the problem

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,169
money does not magically create time

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,419
money does not magically create labor

00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:12,520
money does not magically create help it

00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:14,000
can help some projects but what projects

00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,040
usually need

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,140
just someone to show up in help so we

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,790
want to grow those participants into

00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,050
being maintained errs of themselves in

00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:25,730
picking up some of the maintainer load

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:28,160
and last hoping over the course of the

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,480
rest of the year to find ten people who

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,520
are willing to try to make the case

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,250
during q4 in the budget planning process

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,050
to try to start their own Faust

00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,670
contributor fund of their own I think if

00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,270
we can get there I think that will be

00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:43,100
super exciting for twenty to twenty

00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,390
individuals in the room what can you do

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,340
if you're interested in seeing how this

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,350
goes you can email us at open source and

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,480
indeed calm that doesn't sign you up for

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,920
anything it's an alias that goes to me

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,380
and to people at the table over there

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,380
and say hey I want to know how this goes

00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,960
or I want to try to convince my

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,370
leadership to do something similar

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,320
always advocate for the projects whether

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,750
you are involved in an open-source

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,760
program or an employee who wants to make

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,160
contributions to open source and see

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,890
your company supporting them always ask

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,930
right advocate for those projects ask

00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,090
someone to pick up help on those

00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:20,480
projects you'll be surprised who can say

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:23,330
yes if you work at a company and want to

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,070
take your own steps to democratizing the

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,110
sponsorship process you can start now

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,910
open collective if you're familiar with

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,980
them they have a great gift card program

00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,870
where you can buy digital gift cards to

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,400
give to individual engineers and say go

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,920
sponsor the open source project of your

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,840
choice you can do it with very little

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,830
funds that's a very easy way to get

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,240
going from there I have a slide here

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,920
that says I'll ask questions and I have

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,670
one minute for questions so how about

00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,670
question

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,530
the question of the back was how do you

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,970
measure contributions I did don't have

00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:03,680
time to go deeply into it but this is

00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:07,820
very github focused and that's more or

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,680
less been okay tons of open source

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,050
activity happens outside of github and

00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,630
if people indeed are doing activity out

00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,070
github outside of github we have a forum

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,720
where they can just say hey I'm doing

00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,520
other kinds of open source activity and

00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,740
they tell us what it is and send us a

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,660
link and we trust them to be more or

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,430
less accurate but that can also include

00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,380
things like organizing a meet-up

00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:33,200
right other ways that you can be

00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:35,420
involved so other questions do you ever

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,370
find a project you want to contribute to

00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,870
but then you can't find anyone to give

00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,440
money to or any way to contribute

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:45,560
haven't yet but we're only two months in

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,690
so you know if we what I'm hoping is

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,050
that the nomination process will filter

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,220
out projects that we get that far into

00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:56,450
the process and then don't know how to

00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:58,130
give them money but that's kind of

00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,410
that'll be a problem we saw when we come

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,840
to it but it hasn't happened yet

00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:05,480
hi so a more basic question yeah how

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,280
does how does the composition even start

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,250
with sponsoring project open source

00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,330
projects within a company how does the

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,620
conversations start with those

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:19,370
sponsoring open source projects within

00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:21,830
the company in in in the case prior to

00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:24,380
my joining it really just starts by

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:26,420
someone saying this project needs help

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:29,210
right the reason the webpack got the

00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,740
$10,000 is because the leader or a

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,690
front-end core team saw Shawn Larkin

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,040
from webpack on stage saying hey we just

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,330
went to self-funded model and we could

00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,960
use your help and they said okay and

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:40,940
they talked to somebody and asked right

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,800
there are people inside any given

00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,660
company who either have the

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,160
responsibility to do these kinds of

00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,080
sponsorships or have the capability to

00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,830
do these kinds of sponsorships but very

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,960
few people ask and sometimes it's just

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,720
feeling like you are enabled to go and

00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,150
ask that question if you're not sure

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,590
where to start I would look for the most

00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,810
senior person you can point to in the

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,220
company that cares about open source and

00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,030
ask them if they don't know the answer

00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,970
they can probably put you

00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:11,300
someone else one question so you you

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:13,880
propose one contribution per month right

00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:16,100
you propose every month different

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,430
contribution to different nominations

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:22,580
that is it so it could be just one

00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:25,310
one-shot contribution to one project one

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,830
month and there is no follow-up after

00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:29,240
that I didn't talk about any follow-up

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,880
after that but it is a very good

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,660
question

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:38,060
the best outcome for any program for any

00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:41,870
project is continued long term

00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:44,270
predictable support right a drive-by

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,740
donation of $10,000 to a project is

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,180
great but it's very hard to plan around

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,290
those and anyone that's done any kind of

00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:52,190
fundraising knows that that can be very

00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:53,690
hard as far as following up about the

00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,310
donation we're just now to the point

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,830
that we want to follow up with Jango and

00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,060
say hey how did that work out for you do

00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,100
you know what to do with that do you

00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,690
need help with that right because if

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,760
they need help with figuring out like

00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,780
the best way to use their money the

00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,670
people that software freedom Conservancy

00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,280
and some of the other open-source focus

00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,320
nonprofits can help them we also take

00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,330
projects that are nominated and funnel

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,560
them into our would you like to get

00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,110
started and contributing to open source

00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,340
select these projects here are great

00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,040
ones to get started because we know we

00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,810
use them and we want to push our open

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,380
source participation our contributions

00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:30,080
in that direction and so the hoped and

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,360
effect is that we may not continue to

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,090
send money but we are sending people to

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,150
help them do their maintaining that may

00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:40,310
be all the time we have for questions

00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:42,020
I'm looking to you I'm happy to answer

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,630
questions all the time yes I mean

00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:47,630
there's a lot of interest and as you

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:50,300
mentioned we can follow up at the booth

00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:53,300
you also have another talk specifically

00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,040
on github that's on Sunday yes I have I

00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,930
have another talk on Sunday about why

00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,370
github is not your resume and you should

00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,660
we need to stop using it that way so

00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,430
even though this was very good hub

00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,470
focused the other talk talks about why

00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,000
that's a bad idea and please do come by

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,440
the booth or stop me I'll be easy to

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,940
spot and the blue and orange jumpsuit

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,040
happy to answer questions and keep

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,260
talking okay thank you very much and a

00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:16,000
big thing of applause please

00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,000
