10 years and back to the future! A lot has happened in 10 years and a new generation of technologists and developers is growing up and participating in the community. What are the challenges today and how do we connect them to the previous generations of FOSS developers?

continuing with Harish from Red Hat

00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:09,240
average pillai who many of you already

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,269
know from the community

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,460
he supported Faust Asia over many years

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,400
he's also the individual who's arranged

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,619
many meetups so one of the first time to

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,109
use Linux in Singapore already back in

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:29,099
early 2000s so just give it up for

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:31,430
Harish while he sets up and Thank You

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:37,500

do as well so I had to prioritize so my

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,520
apologies in public to you guys what I

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,739
want to do now is to quickly walk you

through the next 15 minutes of some

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,820
stuff that I thought may be useful and I

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,420
think the title for this particular talk

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:16,500
was supposed to be Ken and back to the

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,939
future I'm going to ask you to do

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,310
something but you need to be very

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,030
careful when you do this could you all

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,030
please stand up

right all right okay what is one zero

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:55,439
one zero so those of you who were born

00:01:47,270 --> 00:02:00,810
from 2009 and later please sit down 2009

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:04,430
and younger 2009 and young ready anybody

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:08,340
here born in 2009 okay

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:10,229
first Asia was was born right first Asia

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,239
was born so it's the tenth birthday I

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,700
leave it to Hong fook to tell the story

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,380
behind that

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:23,190
now what I want to do is the next number

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:35,280
how many of you are younger in other

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:40,160
words was born on or after 1989 1989

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,160
don't be shy I mean I I'm still standing

00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:54,480
are you sure home for you

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:57,960
1989 1989 and younger all right Wow so

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:02,910
leave a few okay what is 1989 this was

00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,270
the first work worldwide web page it's a

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,040
copy

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:12,420
you can find it on the third website so

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,040
it's happy 30th birthday for wide web

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,550
that was I think yesterday if I'm not

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,250
wrong all right so the next number okay

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,680
this is going to be I'm okay let me put

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:27,030
a bet here I know at least 50 percent

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:34,760
will sit down those who are born on or

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:40,620
after 1969 I was right I'm so standing

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,970
1969 I think we should pat ourselves on

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:47,250
the back you know at least spare

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:53,760
yourself on the back because 1969 was

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:56,250
when the internet was first functional

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,220
the internet that we know today was

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:03,840
called ARPANET then so this is a diagram

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:08,760
a map of all the connections that went

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:12,170
through from 1969 December to march 1977

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,880
all within the United States before it

00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:18,180
exited the boundaries and covered the

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,310
rest of the world so thank you all of

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,240
you who are standing including myself so

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:27,560
please sit down

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:31,610
so those of you in between the 30 from

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:35,770
1989 and younger you are part of this

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:39,259
web generation it's not the 1990s people

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,280
the 1989's as well so just remember that

00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:46,280
all right you are part of that so the

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,129
Internet is 50 years old today or not

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:54,409
today this year it will be 50 years old

00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:58,039
on the 30th of October 2019 which is

00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:58,669
what this particular document it's a log

00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,990
file

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:04,400
this was the systemd log file of 1969

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:08,599
right for those of you who get it

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,120
I see only a few got it this is saying

00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:15,229
that a packet was successfully

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:19,250
transmitted between two nodes on the

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:21,379
first connection between two systems in

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,870
two different locations in the west

00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:26,719
coast of the United States so that's a

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:31,580
phenomenal thing in and of itself it is

00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:34,190
handwritten you can still read it that's

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,330
this is the you can actually have a look

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:41,360
at it if you choose to it is being

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,969
displayed in the labs in UC by UCLA

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:50,960
which is one of the notes that this was

00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:54,560
run on so 50 years old there's this

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,840
website I want you to have a look at it

00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,279
says that the name of the site is how

00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,279
old is the Internet

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,940
one of the things that I wanted the

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,830
reason I put this up here is because I

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,949
feel that there's a lot of people who

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:13,940
confuse the worldwide web with the

00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:15,620
Internet this particular site as far as

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,460
this site is concerned is the last line

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:22,880
at the bottom it says assume the

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,759
asterisk from the top is mentioned here

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,370
assuming by internet we mean the

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,849
Internet as we know it today that is the

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,930
world wide web that is so that is

00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,600
actually technically

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,729
incorrect I have actually contacted the

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,470
author I thought most a lot of you also

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:42,350
contact the author say please don't do

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:46,820
this you're confusing the entire space

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:49,280
the internet started in 69 not in 89 so

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,070
please help me contact and get encourage

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,530
them to fix it but it's an interesting

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,820
site nonetheless and what I want to do

00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:03,110
now is to transition a little bit and

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:05,210
look at what happened in 2009 apart from

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,090
Foss Asia being soldered up there was a

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,190
very interesting idea that was hatched

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,530
and I don't know how many of you

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,270
actually know about this in the funny

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:19,060
part is I only found out about it about

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:22,300
three months ago and this is what it is

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:26,090
it's called the world digital library

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:29,000
this was an effort set up initiated by

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:33,759
the u.s. Library of Congress and UNESCO

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,410
to create a repository of digitalized

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:41,199
information this is what the website

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:46,130
looks like it says it has got one a

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:53,030
19147 items from 193 countries ranging

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:56,000
from 8000 BCE till the year 2000 that's

00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,639
a phenomenal amount of stuff to be able

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,039
to have been digitized having said that

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,979
are there only hundred nineteen thousand

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,520
items in books all these years how about

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:10,010
ten thousand years of human existence

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,199
there's only about 20 s than 20 thousand

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,539
items digitized I'm sure there's a lot

00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,250
more so I think this is going to be a

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:18,229
very important thing as we look forward

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,419
we want to see how far back can we go

00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:23,900
and what kind of information can we get

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:26,780
and all of this is being driven on this

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:34,599
thing that we all use and love which is

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:38,690
called the Internet so looking forward

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,479
what's the future possibly like what

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,029
would it be what kind of world would you

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,600
and I be happy to be living in

00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:49,490
I will plus it three things

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:54,080
the first is it has to be trustworthy I

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:56,540
think a lot of us have you know have

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,940
gone through different airports coming

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:03,649
here you have been photographed

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:07,220
fingerprinted probed hopefully not too

00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:12,529
badly I know some systems made through

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:15,950
very cleanly the Suzy AI devices came

00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:18,200
through safely not an issue but the

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,029
thing is trustworthiness is a very

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,980
important aspect for all of us if

00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:24,050
something is not trustworthy we have a

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,579
problem so what does trustworthy in this

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,279
context as far as I'm concerned is about

00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:31,010
the network is the network trustworthy

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:33,560
is the code that runs the network

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,269
trustworthy how do i define trustworthy

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,290
how do I check it out do I test it I

00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:41,209
think we have it in us to be able to try

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,459
to answer some of this we have answers

00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:46,730
to a lot of them already but it is a

00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:48,829
constant battle it's a constant need to

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,020
to keep thinking about it talking about

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:53,959
it and encouraging people to understand

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,640
it and don't get into a complacency more

00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,320
where he says yeah it's trustworthy

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,820
enough I'm not gonna do anything more I

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,430
think that's when we have a failure of

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:05,209
the system the second one is about

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,760
ethics being ethical we have heard and

00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:10,370
read horror stories about AI being used

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,980
for all kinds of stuff nefarious stuff

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,890
and a lot of it had to do with people

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,440
who created those not necessarily

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,630
thinking through all the issues and I

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,610
know in software it's impossible to

00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,100
think through all issues we have been

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:29,510
there so under ethical I would put three

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:34,820
different aspects one is safety is it

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:37,329
secure and is it also fair now it may

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,920
not fall into these three areas directly

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:43,010
it may not be the d3 areas fall directly

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,390
and the ethical stuff but it helps to

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,220
think through what is it that you're

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:52,220
doing and building that is safe ethical

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:55,670
secure as and yet ethical and is fair

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,170
and yet it's ethical to do it and the

00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,499
last one is about empowering

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,989
I think phenomenal to see the amount of

00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:06,589
women sitting in this audience is to me

00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:09,049
fantastic Women's International Women's

00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:13,219
there was this past was it last Friday

00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:15,859
or last the last Friday so belated happy

00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:17,239
Women's Day to all the women here so

00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:25,609
please if there's a lady sitting next to

00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:29,359
you give them a clap thank you so

00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:31,839
empowering includes three components

00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:34,309
which I think a very critical diversity

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,909
ideas have to be coming can come from

00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:36,199
anywhere

00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:39,049
we don't know where it's going to be the

00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:41,809
next great idea but to say that I have

00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:44,389
to exclude a certain group for whatever

00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:48,169
it is we are shortchanging ourselves and

00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:50,359
being inclusive and encouraging we will

00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:53,239
always make mistakes ads are given

00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:54,619
that's the human condition a human

00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:56,629
condition that does not make mistake has

00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:59,179
got a problem that in itself is a

00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:01,939
mistake so we need to fix that but

00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:03,829
mistakes are a given so we need to

00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:06,919
encourage people to experiment try and

00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:08,089
learn from it and do better now these

00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,579
three things are they are talked about

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:13,789
transfer the ethical empowering are a

00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:15,979
bit heavy for this morning session so

00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:19,249
let me change it a little bit that's

00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:24,919
another view there's another view called

00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:28,819
people planet and profit this is the

00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:30,259
this is an economic phrase and it is

00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:33,759
also sometimes labeled as a triple

00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:35,389
bottom line so anything that we do

00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,699
doesn't matter whether you're a

00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:39,859
corporate entity you are doing stuff at

00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:42,079
home with your family wherever three

00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:45,009
parts to this equation triple bottom

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:48,589
line if from an economic point of view

00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:52,249
the cost issues the cost of doing

00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:54,349
something the social impact of that

00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:56,109
something and eventually the

00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:58,489
environmental impact was something I

00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:00,499
mean if you walk out for the you know

00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:03,169
the last maybe three weeks in Singapore

00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:04,819
those of you who who live here we have

00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:07,819
been seeing that the grass is getting

00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:10,159
browner and browner and that is very

00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:12,889
disheartening for me I hate to see brown

00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,180
grass and eventually it dies and then we

00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,720
have a barren patch

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,760
and that's not good why is it happening

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,440
the environment that's a very important

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,550
component we need to think about what

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:29,570
can we as a community of hackers do to

00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:31,610
mitigate that now if I switch this and

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:36,290
look at it from a open source point of

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:40,730
view what we the three components that

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:44,029
will qualify in this space the community

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,430
that is you and I contributors some of

00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:49,790
you guys and the core the stuff that

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:54,110
some of you create this will be the

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:57,589
three points that balances out but this

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:59,870
if you accept these three as critical we

00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:04,160
are faced with challenges in these three

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:07,730
areas the first one is about this looks

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,810
a bit out of alignment is the code we

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:14,750
are we have seen in the last few years

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:18,380
forced projects that have become

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:21,260
co-opted by cloud public cloud service

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:25,250
providers they essentially lock you out

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:29,120
as a project that you cannot contribute

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:32,110
to it anymore and also they do not

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,850
necessarily go upstream back to you

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,980
changes improvements that's a problem

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,450
that's a threat that's a model that's

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,940
something we need to think about what do

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:47,510
we need to do to fix this thing what can

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:49,180
we do then let's look at contributors I

00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:53,450
think it was like late last year

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:56,450
Australia passed a bill on security that

00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:59,150
said that the Australian Government can

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:01,970
come to you as a developer and tell you

00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,610
to put in a backdoor in whatever code

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,339
that you're writing and you cannot tell

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:13,399
anybody about it including your employer

00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:15,860
I want you just think about that how can

00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:18,920
I then trust code that comes out of in

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:22,430
this instance Australia even if that

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:26,570
individual is part of a international

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,220
organization it's a huge problem we have

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,930
to

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,029
make sure that we can address this in

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:35,079
whichever means that we can and make it

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:38,470
happen and all of this is at the end in

00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:41,079
the community false licenses we

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,579
understand what false licenses are but

00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:44,259
in the last few months there have been a

00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:47,980
lot of attempts to create alternate

00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:49,750
false licenses which frankly the ship

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,569
has sailed for as FAR's licensure

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:54,790
concern there's no real need to reinvent

00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:58,420
that wheel or revisit those arguments

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,910
the arguments for that causes a split in

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,100
the community because it clearly does

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,930
not fully appreciate and this is where

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,930
we need to go back in history to figure

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:12,060
out why we are here today and what is it

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:14,529
that we need to do to move forward so

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,589
bottom line no one is going to take away

00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:20,709
your code no one is going to take away

00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:23,829
your skills and no one's gonna take away

00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:25,899
your passion it's really up to you or to

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:28,269
us for the collective us or the

00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,399
collective we in this case that we

00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:33,750
should not let down those who came

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,850
before and brought us here and

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,699
especially for those who will be coming

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,259
later who are not in this room today

00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,800
because it is really up to us to make

00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,689
this happen

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,079
and we need to be completely conscious

00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:49,509
and aware of this all the time I know it

00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:51,670
sounds a bit gloomy but I think it's

00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:54,459
very important at the tenth birthday

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:57,160
when you think about now that you are

00:16:54,459 --> 00:17:00,360
two-digit year old no longer

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,470
single-digit old what else can we do and

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,400
it's very important that we as a

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:09,039
collective are able to do the do so so

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,569
I'll end with this slide I'm not going

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,130
to play the video obviously you know who

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:17,500
this gentleman is is one of my favorite

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:19,900
actors Robin Williams and in the movie I

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,829
just forgot the name of the movie a date

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:27,640
for a society he his statement there

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:30,700
carpe diem seize the day boys make your

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,890
lives extraordinary I think it's really

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,210
is up to us let's make this

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:44,210
extraordinary so thank you

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:44,210
[Applause]

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,690
great Irish thank you for giving us a

00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:53,890
bit of perspective there on the

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,890
