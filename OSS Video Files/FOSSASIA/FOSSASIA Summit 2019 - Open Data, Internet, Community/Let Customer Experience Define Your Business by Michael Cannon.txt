thank you good afternoon

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,300
so it's introduced I'm Michael Cannon

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,480
and I pretty much run a success

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,619
management at accelerant we're pretty

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,840
much online software development company

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,760
that provides solutions for creative and

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,170
marketing agencies around the world so

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,689
that's part of the reason why I get a

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,460
travel a bit it's got people and clients

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,369
really all over the place so a little

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,170
bit lucky I could go do a lot of

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,559
different things in the world but these

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,870
days I spend a lot of my time actually

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:43,770
thinking about what we want to be doing

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:45,899
as as accompanying ourselves okay it's

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,850
not a case of hey I actually want to

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,170
build something cool of course we want

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,809
to do you know we're doing things like

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,129
creating a retail customer engagement as

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,420
part of digital transformation with

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,520
other organizations and things like that

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,260
however before we can actually get to

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,930
that stage we actually need to be

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,480
working with people to figure out what

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,530
really kind of matters for them and so

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,200
I'd like to share a little bit of a

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,030
story with you and it kind of goes like

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,840
this

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:18,180
don't let your success be an accident

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:20,310
all right in the beginning I'll use over

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,409
the past dozen plus years there was

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,390
quite a bit of projects that we had been

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,130
engaged in over time and part of the

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,290
time we did some some good work

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,009
sometimes we do some not-so-good work

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,040
and you know get to sign some really big

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,990
name companies and because the work

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,210
wasn't all that great you would actually

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,280
lose these accounts and it's really

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,100
tough you know pay the bills and little

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,680
things like that if your experiences for

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,409
clients aren't all that frankly

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,259
consistent are great as a case in point

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,820
you can actually have the worst customer

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,280
service in industry but yet your

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,990
business will survive because people

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,020
know what to expect from that experience

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,530
that they have with you now if you're

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,200
kind of like a mid-range company and you

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,190
are sometimes great sometimes pretty

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,670
poor and every interaction is in

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,360
that then customers really don't know

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,190
what to expect of you so they tend to

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,080
move on to something in which they can't

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:27,240
understand what they can expect so as

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,610
part of that inconsistency that happens

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,990
your even your employees might decide to

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,540
leave on so they want somebody that

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:38,070
knows what they're doing so where

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,630
customer experience comes into play is

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,030
actually at this higher level concept

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:46,040
called the customer journey and the

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:49,200
customer journey is really an end-to-end

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:53,550
or actually the start of a continuous

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,820
cycle for how somebody count a client a

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,190
customer become aware of your

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,000
organization how they become to like

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,650
what you're doing begin to trust it be

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,870
involved with your doing things and

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,670
hopefully growing a bit of value well

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,380
this is where we had to realize that we

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,810
needed to step back from our

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,890
inconsistent experiences it's like

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,360
instead of doing you know these kind of

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,590
operations for this kind of client these

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
kind of operations for another kind of

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,860
client we actually need to start

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,390
figuring out well what's the baseline

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,040
what's the kind of core experience that

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,280
we don't have with our within our

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,590
organization and deliver to that so by

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,020
stepping back and taking a look at the

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,850
whole picture of what we want to do then

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,950
we came into this customer journey

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:47,489
so the first part of it is really

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,630
getting to know about the kinds of

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,019
customers that you want to be working

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,000
with and I met even before you get to

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,440
worry about this you need to be knowing

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,410
what it is that you as an organization

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,570
want to provide is it I piece of

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:05,310
software is it a food service or is it a

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,860
yeah a medical care thing I'm just being

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,420
on provide massages but the thing is no

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,070
matter what the offering is you need to

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,450
have an idea what it is that you really

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,620
want to do so then you can start

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,169
figuring out what that customer journey

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,220
is to know hey these are the kind of

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,140
clients you want to be working with

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,530
these are the ways that you want to be

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,970
interacting with them and I can get a

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,860
little bit more into it but really

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,570
you need to know what you want to do as

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,800
an organization so then you can start

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:35,530
making other people aware about it so as

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,740
people begin to get aware of what your

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,270
organization does you need to start

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,920
worrying about this thing called build

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,590
some confidence okay

00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:49,290
oh actually what we're calling it liking

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:51,400
it so under the concept of liking it is

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,200
going back to a little bit of the old

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,730
school thing I know a lot of the

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,400
operations that we do these days is

00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:00,130
based around SAS software as a service

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,870
and other there's similar things however

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:07,210
what's going on is to bring back the you

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,160
know better customer relationship is to

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,500
actually have a relationship with the

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,870
customers that you do have and frankly

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,800
it can be a case of have a personal

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,420
interaction with actually in some cases

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,570
especially if you're doing with larger

00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,640
accounts no no other kids

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,090
what kind of schooling is going on and

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,820
what kind of vacations and the real

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,560
point though is have a relationship so

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,230
they can understand where relevancy for

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,370
your organization fits in to for the

00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:40,169
kinds of accounts that you want to be

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,169
working with now

00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:50,009
where we get to the trusting or actually

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,530
trusting so that we can get started on

00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:55,650
doing something this is kind of where

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,849
the all the different ideas you might

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,449
have about the things that you want to

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:03,090
do need to come into place as far as an

00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,319
actual road map or in our case we

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,349
actually utilize something that's called

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,840
a storyboard and this particular

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:12,479
storyboard is actually the third epic

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,110
because since we're in agile we do a lot

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,719
of a h&L work we utilize the usual I say

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:23,490
epic terminology as long as well as kind

00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:26,699
of releases so what each of these cards

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:28,710
represent is a point of interaction that

00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,620
one of nine different kind of roles

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:35,370
across our organization and and the

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,940
customer need to be concerned about but

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:41,490
the thing is is I say across a staffing

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,690
engagement where organization has a

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,120
little bit of a capacity capability

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,190
shortfall some of our people come in and

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,860
help them technically we've actually

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,110
identified about 700 points of the

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,240
engagement or not really points a

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,409
negation what kinds of interactions well

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,599
frankly it's not feasible to really

00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,460
automate and have all those things on

00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,219
the on a manual basis so what you can

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,080
come up doing is actually say well

00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:09,180
here's the full potential of what we

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,469
could do but you start identifying well

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,520
what are the things that really have the

00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:15,629
greatest impact okay and so that allows

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,330
you to ensure they get the right people

00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:20,370
you're coming across with irrelevant

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:23,219
solutions and be frankly having some

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,539
clear agreements between yourself those

00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:29,370
that you're working with and the people

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:31,289
they want to be servicing now since you

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,599
have a bit of the roadmap you got your

00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:36,210
project systems kind of going you your

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,409
clients know what's what's going on you

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,129
have basically what we consider the

00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:42,120
fourth stage or execution or

00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:46,229
demonstrating that trust you know

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,330
getting things done and really here it's

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,979
again going back to following the game

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,820
plan if you say you're gonna do daily

00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,310
stand-ups and weekly releases or

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,830
you're going to have a certain kind of

00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,680
communication protocol it's again it's

00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:05,480
about the consistency and also ensuring

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,230
that the that the customer or that who

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,600
you're dealing with

00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,390
has consistent in good outcomes you know

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,910
so along the way again the the key point

00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:17,120
is be eliminating inconsistencies in the

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,830
things that your organization does and

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,860
lastly one of my favorite parts

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:25,280
especially where I'm coming in is

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,800
because you've had a successful

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,560
relationship of being able to provide

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,210
some service or some product for the

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,330
kind of accounts that you've been

00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:37,700
working with whether they're consumers

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,080
or they're large enterprises you can

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,790
start working on the important thing of

00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,940
starting to grow your value together

00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:46,850
where instead of being alright he here's

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,350
an outsourcer and here's a company start

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,810
actually start working together as a

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,730
partner so such that one plus one is in

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,050
two but it's actually eleven because by

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,580
working together by collaborating

00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:01,930
together you can start doing quite a bit

00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:04,130
more yeah I love the word together so

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,080
there's lots parts really ensuring that

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:12,230
you're starting on have future alignment

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:16,270
for what's going on now getting into the

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:19,870
customer journey customer experience

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:24,550
maybe a broader term customer success

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:27,410
this is a concept that came out about

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:30,740
ten years ago and it's kind of much

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,570
touted and I admit when I was first kind

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,050
of pushed into my role not really pushy

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,180
but I kind of jumped to my role my

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,470
initial enlist of hey things I'm going

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,970
to say hey then we're gonna we're gonna

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,380
focus on these things was like fifty

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,790
items long and I figured with my team

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,760
would come up with a hundred bad I kind

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,880
of mentioned earlier became 700 so what

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,190
I like to point out is to do something

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,140
like this well it's actually a lot more

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,030
effort than you're going to be expecting

00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:00,380
and so because of that we actually need

00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:02,690
to come back and well frankly focus on

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,390
just a few aspects what is it that

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,590
causes the most friction is it the

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,890
communication delay

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,390
is it the quality aspects of something

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,670
that we're doing with is a lack of

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:18,830
expertise that's being applied is it

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,140
risk not being reduced as much as it

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,790
should for where you're going so when

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,770
you get into something for the customer

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:28,130
journey and just start banging on the

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:30,529
customer experience you want to frankly

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,450
be worried about just a thin line of

00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,960
your business you do not want to try to

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,710
do everything all at once i sample say

00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:42,500
Pizza Hut

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:44,089
wanted to really do two things

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,330
twofold at a high level really

00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:49,580
streamline the online ordering of their

00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,540
daily Pizza specials which in turn goes

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,700
out to the store so that they get

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,190
delivered okay well the thing is is

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,070
instead of completely revamping their

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:02,120
online Arc ecommerce platform what they

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:05,410
did is just went for introducing some in

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:09,200
sets and actually ran a secondary system

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:11,030
alongside of the primary so by doing

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,530
that they were actually able to divorce

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:16,089
themselves from pre-existing

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:19,880
infrastructure okay so the idea here is

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:22,490
just worry about trying to do one aspect

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,050
or one thin slice of what of your

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,589
business that you want to try to focus

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,670
on okay and really remember at a high

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:30,650
level it's about the people and

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,900
processes that kind of lead into systems

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:37,280
and most importantly keep it short and

00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,990
sweet this is definitely a case of you

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,310
can make things too complicated which is

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:45,470
something that we've run into it's like

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:46,940
even as we've been going along we keeps

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,180
having to step back how can make it

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,180
simpler so that people understand things

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,180
now

00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,960
the downsides to customer journey that a

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,350
lot of organizations think they just

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:05,650
think it's a give a couple people the

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,870
roll and throw it out there well I have

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,190
to met this what I do now is really when

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,380
the greatest challenges that I've ever

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,110
had in my career I've been doing IT for

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,930
about 35 years and it's actually the

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,690
most fun and most loving because I've

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,400
actually had to rethink how everything

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,860
in an organization works it's like

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,240
whenever I've been involved with whether

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,450
it's my own companies or other companies

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,340
you you get to the point of there's

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,620
always something missing but weirdly

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,900
under the customer success customer

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,270
journey aspects everything that we do

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,490
that skier tours is customer experience

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:42,610
and even an employee experience is all

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,230
about a purpose so that means that

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,900
organization needs to have a purpose

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,910
because what then happens is the or the

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,370
organization purpose defines what kind

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,200
of values that the organization have and

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,970
if those values are there then we know

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,920
what kind of people we want to have and

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,410
why are the people matter because the

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,760
people define those relationships or

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,840
create those processes that we're going

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,140
to be working with and when we're going

00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,820
back to this consistency concept it's

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,490
fine if you got a bunch of processes but

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,920
if there's no system in place to

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,930
actually bring it all together whether

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,150
it's from a tactical aspect or a

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,180
strategic overview and a future

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,180
alignment thing it's not going to work

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,180
so

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,740
oh yeah my favorite part even doing

00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:32,209
something simple I thought this 18

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,680
months was a bunch of baloney it's like

00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:34,250
now we're smart we'll get through it in

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,860
like six months

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,750
oh my god I we keep kind of simplifying

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,110
things and we're still at about nine

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:44,829
months and I can even see version one

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,300
for doing something really well is about

00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:49,939
is about nine months all right excuse me

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,829
is about eighteen months but for what

00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:53,660
we're working on relay on solidifying

00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:56,750
the way that we do account operations

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:59,870
and stephannie operations we actually

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:04,060
started seeing major improvements within

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:06,439
about six months so get a little recap

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:10,759
you know when it comes to like customer

00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:13,029
journeys you know again focus on a small

00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:16,160
part of the business that's in to end

00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:19,279
empower the people to be to do the

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,899
things that need to be done be talking

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,860
with everybody that's involved this is

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,600
actually really one of the coolest

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,120
things that I really really like about

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,089
customer journey is everyone is involved

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:34,129
in it I actually have come to realize

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:35,839
that this is a really good check of if

00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:37,459
the organization really knows what

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,139
they're about which kind of goes back to

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:42,110
my original statement of don't let

00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,699
success be an accident I know before we

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:48,339
were lucky now we know what the heck

00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:50,269
we're doing what's also kind of nice is

00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:52,579
especially when you get into the

00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:53,839
customer journey as a way you can't

00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:56,329
really just manage people but you need

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,100
to be able to determine a way to lead

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,079
them and the way to do that leadership

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,129
is by having a decision framework and

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,540
getting to the decision framework

00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:04,759
actually comes out to understand what

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,759
the purpose is for the organization the

00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,439
values around it and what's what's

00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,699
really the priorities around the kinds

00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:12,699
of engagements and counts that you have

00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:15,259
so once you have those sort of things

00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:16,939
the team that is on that account or on

00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:18,439
that engagement can actually be able to

00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:21,079
make the decisions that need to be made

00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,160
so the right thing you know it's

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,829
basically the right thing and the next

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,170
right decision gets handled and lastly

00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:30,220
most importantly especially under the

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,120
agile concept always be having regular

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,269
retrospectives and iterations for what's

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:39,350
going on now wonderfully I've

00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:43,029
kind of wrapped it I'm kind of curious

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:45,079
who else here is maybe on the

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:47,809
non-development technical side of the

00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:49,910
house or whose customer-facing how about

00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:52,160
the outs customer-facing okay well

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,649
mushara yeah I'll come back to you but

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,860
is vivec right yeah how are you customer

00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:56,860
facing

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,040
okay and behind you are you involved

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:20,130
with customers

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:20,130
ah okay all right and back here now okay

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,779
yeah great thanks Emma Shari let

00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:41,160
everybody else know how you interact

00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:42,660
with people all right so actually one of

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,009
the things that I kind of like to point

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,209
out is when it does come around the

00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:48,319
customer experience Moodle I kind of

00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:51,959
keep throwing our word customer around

00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:53,339
it's actually about the people and it's

00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,660
not just the external people to an

00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:58,470
organization but it's even the people

00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:01,139
within and really with that I would

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:07,100
really look like to be able to take your

00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:07,100
questions thank you yes

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,240
yeah

00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,900
been there done that

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:42,040
weirdly when we started saying no that

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:46,550
what the customer was asking for or

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:50,360
providing alternatives started standing

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:52,730
up for what we believed in it was

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,200
actually yeah it's kind of like when we

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,880
started having more of a backbone for

00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,820
how we felt that things really needed to

00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,990
be and sticking with it that actually

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,470
started changing the kind of

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:06,740
conversations that we were having and in

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:09,970
many ways I think that's sort of the the

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:14,810
the turning point also being upfront

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:18,080
that our relationship is not about being

00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:20,060
given something the term is thrown over

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,010
the fence it's like we have to work

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,890
together it's like even if we're going

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,570
to the restaurant to get a burger I mean

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,170
I have food allergies up the yin-yang

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,760
it's terrible it's like I need to be

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,290
able to actually communicate with my

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,480
server who then needs to communicate

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,800
with the cook to be able to get

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,540
something that's not literally gonna

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:43,340
kill me or at least make me really ill

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:46,790
for for a while and it's like when

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:50,750
people are willing to communicate and be

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:53,600
kind of trusting truthful and

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,490
transparent then we can actually get to

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,330
you know relate really higher-level

00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,330
relationships

00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:09,590
yeah absolutely I you know as a

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,150
backstory it's like years ago sure our

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,980
thing was doing two to five thousand

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,560
dollar kind of opportunities whether

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:19,010
it's project product or staff and

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,270
engagements now we're much more into you

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,310
know a hundred thousand dollars actually

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:29,060
a little bit on the small side you know

00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:31,130
what really means is we're see somebody

00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,300
at the pet store

00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,190
really just needs to be able to talk to

00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,810
you for about five minutes to do a ten

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:39,230
dollar sale or even a hundred dollar

00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:41,270
sell my conversations might last in

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,760
between six months to three years before

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:46,160
something comes around but that's we're

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,560
actually having to be really interested

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,420
in people having to know what is it that

00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,040
their organization wants to be

00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,230
accomplishing is really coming into play

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,600
because whenever you are talking to

00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:01,090
somebody it can't just be all about the

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:04,490
sales aspect you know it's kind of I

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:07,310
actually have various kinds of nurturing

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:10,160
cycles and and frankly I really actually

00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,480
mentioned something like oh hey we've

00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,490
got some free people you know I'll be

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,720
like hey we just launched Pottery Barn

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,270
in the Middle East

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,670
Oh city of dreams over here is you know

00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,620
doing something pretty cool but before

00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,500
all that it's like oh my gosh it's like

00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,020
mind if I minus five degrees outside you

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,090
know how are you surviving the winter

00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,340
it's really sorry about being personable

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:33,320
with the people so really kind of going

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,880
back to more truthful or more authentic

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,310
relationships and frankly if you just

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,860
don't get it with that person from over

00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,860
20 of your sales people or the marketer

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:49,850
okay so you mentioned something quite

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:55,220
interesting personable I've come to

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:58,700
realize that even as typical geeks and

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,870
as a team it is a very very good idea

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:06,480
for people to be personable yeah but

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:09,480
then what

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,890
do you have any recommendations on how

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,510
to train geeks to be more personable in

00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,080
some ways it's a little bit of an easy

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:20,370
one

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,200
first off is actually it's not such an

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,030
easy one where like you got to go back

00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,160
to what the organization purpose is

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:28,680
because then that also starts definable

00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,450
what's what kind of values are important

00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,010
to you for your organization because

00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,420
then those kinds of values define what

00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,580
kind of people that you want to hire for

00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:38,040
for our work at accelerant

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:41,430
you know it's called eco enthusiastic

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,840
kind and open so the people that we come

00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,340
in frankly they need to be able to

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,280
communicate because communication is the

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,660
key for everything that we do sure we

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,570
might be able to do video conferences

00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,130
but guess what you still need to write

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,810
something that other people can

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:58,560
understand

00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:01,110
however when weather we just want to be

00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:04,890
a little bit more or grow so we actually

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:07,110
have a life coach at at our place of

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,640
employment and at first I thought was

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,190
like when I was wishy-washy things no

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm like totally hardcore for it because

00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,720
the life coach actually really

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:19,020
demonstrates that we care about somebody

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,640
personally and professionally and you

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,630
know sometimes I even have talked to my

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,730
life coach about marriage issues but

00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,370
it's through that enabling the ability

00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:33,960
to have soft skills development within

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:36,320
the organization two minutes and 30

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,320
seconds

00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:53,580
yeahit's I've seen it around a little

00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:56,470
bit in many ways it's kind of like I'm a

00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:00,369
more personable chief operation

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,899
chief operating officer and it also

00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:07,330
depends upon what the organization

00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:12,519
structure is again for my particular

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:14,139
role is really about the overall the

00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:16,869
overall customer success and for us

00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:21,929
customer success means highly engaged

00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:26,229
teams positive account experiences and

00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:28,059
expected outcomes so that pretty much

00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:30,789
means that account managers project

00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:32,619
managers and engineering managers report

00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:35,590
to me and then through them all the

00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:38,369
delivery so that's achieve success

00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,369
Officer for us

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:47,860
it was a bit of attempt pushing towards

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:50,140
a holic recei or basically you know it's

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,000
really being self-managed teams driving

00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,960
towards eliminating silos but that's

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,429
really one of the biggest things that

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,370
that goes on here when you're dealing

00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:59,620
with the customer journey is you have to

00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,390
break the silos like crazy it's like

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,460
you're doing new status meetings even

00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,309
marketing you know some marketing rep

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:11,950
needs to be there people to be aware

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:15,039
all right 57 seconds 56:53 oh you've

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:17,950
been fantastic well feel free to holler

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,730
at me it's Michael accelerant or the
