Title: How open source participation plays into hiring by Duane O'Brien
Publication date: 2019-04-01
Playlist: FOSSASIA Summit 2019 - Open Data, Internet, Community
Description: 
	17 March 2019 11:10, Lecture Theatre

You have heard that having a GitHub profile can help when job hunting. Is it true? How can you get started? What if you donâ€™t have the time?


You are hiring to fill a position, and you have two great candidates. One has a robust history of working in open source, and the other has no history at all. Is this an easy choice?

This session will look at the implications of working in open source, from the perspectives of both the candidate and the hiring manager. Individuals will come away with an understanding of how open source participation affects their hireability, how they can get started, and what to do when active participation is challenging. Hiring managers will come away with an understanding of how to evaluate the open source work of potential candidates, how to evaluate candidates with no history, and how requiring an open source footprint creates harmful bias.

um thank you for coming to the talk

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,730
thank you for being at the panel earlier

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:08,460
my name is Dwayne O'Brien I am the head

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,219
of open source at indeed I am also a

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,670
hiring manager I probably should change

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,870
that URL but come to the indeed booth

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,130
downstairs and talk to us if you're

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,680
interested in hearing about the roles we

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,330
have open quick disqualifier I'm gonna

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,330
talk about some things in the talk that

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,550
are my own views if you hear things that

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,730
are exciting and and make you very happy

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,380
then I would say all all hail to indeed

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,260
and if you hear things that make you

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,640
very angry or make you want to come up

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,250
and have a very strong debate about it

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,530
that's probably me come argue with me or

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,790
yell at me on Twitter or anything like

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,210
that

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,399
so the subtitle for the talk was how

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,940
open source participation plays into

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,050
hiring you know it's also called don't

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,120
judge candidates by their github

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,070
profiles and I can sum most of this talk

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,890
up in one word and that one word is

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,930
don't don't look at candidates that

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,699
you're looking to hire and make judgment

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,460
calls about them based on their github

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,680
profiles further I would contend that

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,659
github activity is a bad indicator and

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,790
hiring and we should stop using it now

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,979
bad indicator in this case does not mean

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,140
it is a counter indicator that it's

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,930
telling us bad things it just means that

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,670
github activity does not tell us what we

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,759
typically think it might be telling us

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,640
and that's why we should not rely on it

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,070
as part of hiring this is because github

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,630
does not own the world of open source

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,210
and that github open source

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,750
participation does not necessarily

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,549
indicate candidate quality and open

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,100
source participation requires time that

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,040
not everybody has and I'm gonna dig into

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,189
all of these as as the as the talk

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,020
progresses a quick show of hands any

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,320
hiring managers in the room any people

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,320
who are responsible for hiring decisions

00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:58,170
all right so maybe 10% of the room so

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,119
I'm guessing the rest of you are not

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,710
responsible for hiring you work in or

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,259
aspire to work in the software industry

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,689
in some way

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,220
and then okay more or less the rest of

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,340
the room with a few people who may have

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,550
slightly different roles so for

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,170
individuals again I want to give you

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,599
tools that will help you advocate during

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,860
the hiring process and for hiring

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,930
managers I'm going to talk a little bit

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,790
about what some candidate alternatives

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,630
might be when you're doing these kinds

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,120
of evaluations

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,610
now we before we go too far into this I

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,959
want to make it clear that this is not

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,400
an anti github talk

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,660
I don't hate github I don't have

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,090
anything against github I'm actually

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,390
very very positive on github

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,430
I you'll hear me sometimes go back and

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,650
forth between the phrase open source

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,870
participation and github activity this

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,569
is really more focused on on github but

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,650
don't take it as a big anti github rant

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,000
I think that they have made a tremendous

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,739
contribution to the open source

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,709
community and changed the way open

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,620
source has worked for certainly the last

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:03,000
ten years or so so a quick story time

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,790
about me I was working at a company two

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,319
or three companies ago and I was working

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,989
on a product that used a lot of open

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,790
source software and I literally sat next

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:15,900
to a team that was being put together to

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,660
build a large open source project and I

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,980
was a JavaScript engineer I should put a

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,030
JavaScript engineer of quotes there

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,160
because I don't think I was very good at

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,750
it I was a JavaScript engineer at the

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,750
team and they were hiring for a

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,370
JavaScript engineer and so I was excited

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,739
I was already in the company I applied

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,510
for the role and I met literally with

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,459
everyone in the team starting with the

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,290
hiring manager and then you know a

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,329
series of meetings with people where we

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,180
talked about technology and the goals of

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,780
the project and everything in the first

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,549
meeting with a hiring manager he said

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,560
well you know we're excited that you

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,799
want to come work for us I joined the

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,180
team

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,410
you know it's an open source project

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,640
we'd like you to you should feel free to

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,910
you know fork it take a look for an

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,209
issue find a bug that you feel like you

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,920
might want to take on and you know take

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,530
do some work on that submit a pull

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,260
request and see how that goes

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,880
now we went through the process of

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,349
meeting with everyone else it was not

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,230
something that I really had time to get

00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,329
to

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,340
and at the end of the process I was not

00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,260
offered the role and when I asked him

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,510
why he said well we invited you to

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,070
submit a pull request of the project and

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,530
you didn't do anything so we just

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,060
assumed it wasn't that important to you

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,460
now what the hiring manager didn't know

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,990
at the time was that I was both the

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,180
single earner and a three-person

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,820
household and the primary caregiver so

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:40,570
all of my time that I didn't have at

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,669
work was spent on the house and there

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,440
was just really not reasonable time

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,470
available in the off hours for me to

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,290
fork and submit a pull request or to

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,919
kind of dig into a bug now there is an

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:55,270
aspect of this looking back on it today

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,830
that I can see I probably could have

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,900
made some kind of smaller contribution

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,669
in the time but I had very very tight

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,669
time constraints on the time that was

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:05,530
available to me when I was not at work

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,780
and I would like to say that I very

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,810
patiently and clearly explained this to

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:14,290
him what actually came out was probably

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:18,160
more angry and maybe a bit of a rant and

00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,780
some frothing and I explained that I was

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,660
you know primary caregiver I don't have

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,790
the same kind of availability at a time

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:29,110
and he acknowledged that but in the end

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:32,110
I still did not get the role so the the

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,940
problem of personal time availability

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,510
and contributing to open source and it

00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,180
being a problem overall is it's not

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,750
particularly a new idea ash Dryden was

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,820
writing about this where was this in

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,470
2013 many jobs require open source

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,320
contributions to even consider a

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,210
candidate and this was in the blog post

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,030
her ethics of unpaid labor and open

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,400
source community November 2 2013 and I

00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,510
wanted me to quote from that further

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,950
deciding that someone is a good

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,590
programmer based solely on their

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,660
publicly available clue code excludes

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,250
far more than marginalized people it

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,110
also excludes anyone who can't release

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,510
their code publicly because of licensing

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,010
or security reasons this also includes a

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,289
large number of freelancers and

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,729
contractors who are unable to publicly

00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,030
claim that they worked on a project for

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,940
legal reasons

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:23,300
so requiring open source contributions

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,980
as part of the hiring process biases

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,000
against a whole category of candidates

00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,760
and some of them tend to be

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,770
traditionally marginalized people but

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,380
another whole other category of people

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,750
that just can't be involved in open

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,460
source for one reason or the other this

00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,440
is also not a new idea it is not an

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,700
unpopular idea it is a thing that seems

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,590
to come up every few months I first

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,210
submitted the I think I submitted the

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:51,380
first version of this talk around

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,400
January last year as there was a company

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,050
called get Lance

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,290
that decided that they were going to

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,720
provide automatic candidate ranking and

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,340
evaluation based only on their github

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,930
activity so they would scrub through

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,580
github they would look for people who

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,250
have activity and they would provide

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,200
higher ability and ranking scores so

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,330
this was the the business model that

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,330
they were proposing we see Rebecca

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,440
Turner here calling them out github you

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,180
know it was already fairly well

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,460
understood for the past few years among

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,590
people who were paying closest attention

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,120
to it that github makes a bad resume for

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,260
a lot of reasons but then there are

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,660
these people that came along and said ah

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,979
but what if we what if we used some

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,450
machine learning it just make it an

00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:32,780
algorithm no it's it's still a bad

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:35,000
decision so it's not an unpopular idea

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,090
it comes up every few months about six

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,560
months later someone else posted this

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,020
thread that kind of blow up on Twitter

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,430
that indicated that he doesn't even look

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,060
at resumes anymore he just looked at

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,290
people's github profiles to see you know

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,210
if they're people that he wants to hire

00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,520
any things everybody else should too

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,370
after being taken strongly to task for

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,130
this position he later claimed that he

00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,300
was trolling people in the troll defense

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,820
whenever someone says something that

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,770
maybe they shouldn't have said online so

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,450
it comes up every few months and I've

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,190
had this conversation a number of times

00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,470
over the past few years with friends

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,350
with colleagues with former colleagues

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:14,090
who are now hiring managers so why is it

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,740
that we keep doing this why do we keep

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,630
coming back to this idea that we just

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,260
want to look at github and and hire

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,380
people based off of what they do there

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,410
well part of it is because we love data

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,270
if you look at this you know github

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,340
profile we've got all kinds of great

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,669
stuff here right we have a year's worth

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,560
of very easily visualized activity we

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,630
can tell that they are constantly active

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,890
on github we can see that they are a

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,690
number of a bunch of different

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,180
organizations they're just a prolific

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,100
contributor and this is really appealing

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,260
like we love visualizations in

00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,450
engineering right and most you know

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,000
technical hiring managers are engineers

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,260
who either grew into the role or got

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,760
senior enough that they were pushed into

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,770
the role so when you see something like

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,050
this ah now I can see lots of data we

00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,760
love visualizations but it's not just

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,740
because we love data we also teach this

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,630
behavior we teach it in colleges we

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,190
teach it boot camps we teach it in

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,380
hacker schools and we teach it during

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,410
the hiring process when we say we'd like

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,960
to see your github right in in college

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:16,500
boot camp at hacker schools we we tell

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,360
people that having open source activity

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,300
having a github profile can make it

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,010
easier for people to hire you right it

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,290
improves your chances of hiring that

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:28,500
reinforces that same behavior that

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,780
reinforces that same learning and part

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,890
of this like I said is because those

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:37,170
engineers who the the hiring managers

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,850
are probably former engineers in

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,160
particular the new hiring managers now

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,900
are in this little bubble that they have

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,520
created they they started off in

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,560
engineering when github was just the de

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,500
facto standard right they've never

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,740
worked in a world with SVN or CVS for

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,480
visual sourcesafe or perforce got those

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,600
all out of order but you get the general

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,310
idea so they came up during the the time

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,260
of github this is just how everything

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,520
works of course they're gonna look for

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,720
people who look like them and who came

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,220
up the same way that they did because

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,870
they believe it does people were going

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,200
to be successful and they're gonna hire

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,420
what they know now you might be looking

00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,980
off all of this and see they say that

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,990
you don't see a particular problem here

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,370
but I'm gonna dive into what I believe

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,870
some of the problems are and the first

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,050
one is obviously is that there is open

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,360
source outside of github so who knows

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,029
digital oceans

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,069
all right great lots and lots of people

00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:31,670
who knows about their currents quarterly

00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:33,799
newsletter okay I think this is one of

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,739
the coolest things that digitalocean

00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,939
does and that might tell you as much you

00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:40,249
need to know about myself because it's

00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:42,049
not technical it's it's a survey that

00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:45,439
they do they release it every quarter

00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:47,509
it's called currents and they try to

00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:49,339
gather what they see as emerging trends

00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:52,369
or kind of emerging ideas within the

00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:56,179
world of open source in which one was

00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:58,009
this this was sometime last year if you

00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:59,779
go to digital ocean comm slash currents

00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:02,239
you can find all of their reports which

00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:04,999
source code posit or et you do do you

00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:08,299
use less than half of them said github

00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:09,980
that means more than half of them use

00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:12,139
something else all right so we already

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,059
know from this that there's open source

00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,619
that happens outside of github we know

00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:18,379
there's open source on launchpad at

00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:21,139
Apache in bitbucket and then newer and

00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:23,749
more innovative source code control

00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,790
platforms like glitch that are doing

00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,869
things that are maybe even a little

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,489
beyond me

00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:29,779
we know open source happens outside of

00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:32,749
github because we also know about

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:35,419
getting it lab and the ability to import

00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:38,119
code in from github so this is a report

00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:41,929
that was released by get lab was a June

00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:43,519
3rd in 2018 showing the velocity of

00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:46,639
projects that were moving off of github

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,179
into get lab who knows what happened

00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:53,480
right about here right Microsoft applies

00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,949
github and tremendous tremendous volume

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,610
of projects just moved to off of github

00:11:54,949 --> 00:12:01,850
on to get file now Microsoft has done a

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,499
lot over the past few years to really

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,720
become meaningful members of the

00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:07,699
open-source community I personally

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,829
believe that we're seeing them put a lot

00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:14,480
of their time and effort into that

00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:15,829
messaging sincerely but over time who

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,269
knows what's going to happen with github

00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,259
and Microsoft and who knows if this

00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,850
chart will once again

00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:22,669
see a tremendous rise or if something

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,949
else will come along so we know there's

00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:27,439
github back to that we know there's open

00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:29,809
source activity outside of github so if

00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:32,089
you bias candidates in one way or

00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:34,129
another based on their github activity

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:36,679
you're filtering out some percentage of

00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,789
the other candidates as well there's

00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,729
also a problem on how you measure

00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:42,019
measure participation so would anyone

00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:46,249
want anybody want to hire this

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:50,029
JavaScript engineer no hands went up

00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:51,949
it's probably good idea that's me I was

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:54,229
not a very active JavaScript engineer

00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:56,779
but and you probably don't want me in

00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:59,149
that hole today but if you take this

00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:01,149
profile someone who's clearly involved

00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:03,559
in JavaScript and you take this profile

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:07,699
which of these two JavaScript engineers

00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:08,989
do you want to talk to first well this

00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,429
one has a lot of activity they seem

00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,749
pretty prolific you might want to talk

00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:13,669
to them first and you'll see you realize

00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,410
that this is Douglas Crockford one of

00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,899
the co-creators of JavaScript Discoverer

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:21,220
of JSON and crater jslint he knows a

00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:24,079
thing or two about JavaScript right so

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,959
if all you're looking at is activity as

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,850
a filter you're likely to Center

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,439
centralize your efforts on candidates

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,519
look like this and miss candidates who

00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:34,549
may be more senior or maybe doing

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,899
architecture kind of work now you might

00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,999
not do this individually as a hiring

00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:40,579
manager but your recruiters very well

00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:42,199
could be right or other people who are

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,819
helping source candidates very well

00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:45,709
could be if you're telling them to look

00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:49,910
for active github profiles they'll miss

00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:52,549
people like Doug an activity in and of

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,769
itself doesn't really mean a whole lot

00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:56,899
it's a little bit like hiring your most

00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:59,449
prolific forum member to be your

00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,369
community manager well maybe that the

00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:03,109
right person maybe they're just the

00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:05,059
loudest troll and they like you know

00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:07,039
getting involved in conversations or

00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:09,769
maybe they're just very pedantic and

00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:12,409
they can't let go of nitpicky

00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:14,720
conversations about words and I'll read

00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:17,479
this out of a quote from a blog that

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,549
came out last sorry in 2013 so really

00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:22,220
your github profile displays two things

00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:24,049
how influential you are and how easily

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,119
you can be coerced into constantly

00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:27,610
working it's honestly about as relevant

00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:29,770
to a decent hiring

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,050
as your Klout score was taught to thing

00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,690
over here

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:38,190
no hands okay awesome Klout was this

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:41,440
thing in the US that basically tried to

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,510
measure your influence based on looking

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,050
at your social media profiles right so

00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,520
you know how much you would crawl

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,660
through Twitter posts and a bunch of

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,660
other things and it would try to

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,190
determine you know how much influence

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,840
you could have in conversations about

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,310
specific topics like how much how much

00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,380
weight does your word carry when it

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,110
comes to JavaScript actually between the

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,430
time that I created or submitted the the

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,510
first proposal for this talk and the

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,330
time that I gave at Klout went out of

00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,760
business and so I had to update and add

00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,170
this slide so if github activity is

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,680
about as useful as your Klout score

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:18,880
that's something else that that metaphor

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:22,320
tells us so let's talk about the kinds

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,320
of people who would not be on github

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:28,180
like most of my tech career they may

00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,500
have been doing internal work only right

00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,810
they might have been working entirely on

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,180
prepaid carry software they might have

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,830
been working on software that they just

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,850
weren't allowed to work externally and

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,670
they just don't have anything to show

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,350
for it right they may there may have

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:45,970
been company policies in place that

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:49,960
expressly disapprove participation in

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:53,710
free and open source projects now in the

00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,080
US and I can really only speak more

00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,030
effectively about what US employment

00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,470
agreements are like but in the u.s. it

00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,180
is not uncommon for you to sign an

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,250
employment as part of joining a company

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,890
an agreement as part of joining a

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,380
company that says that all the work that

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,000
you do while you were employed for us is

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,150
technically company property

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,090
now how enforceable that is really

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,890
depends on region to region and it's

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,810
usually not as enforceable as companies

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,780
might believe it is but it certainly has

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,370
a chilling effect on engineers who want

00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,350
to get involved in open-source projects

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,390
and I've talked to a number in there and

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,890
many different companies who see

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,350
employments like agreements like this

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:35,560
assume they're just can't contribute to

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:38,680
open source and so they never try but

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,300
your company might actually have really

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,620
aggressive policies around this

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,880
for example if you're doing government

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,320
work especially if you're doing a

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,290
government work that might have some

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,690
kind of clearance you might be bound by

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,940
an on an NDA a nondisclosure agreement I

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,860
just can't talk to you about the work

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,330
that I'm doing and I can't contribute

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,070
into the open-source community based on

00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,660
the work that I'm doing because I'm I've

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,149
signed a piece of paper that will make

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,610
me fireball and suable if I do that and

00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:07,240
some people just don't want to and that

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,050
has to be okay there was a comment I

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,380
don't know if he's still in the room

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:15,069
here on the panel where Michael was

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:17,410
talking about recognizing open-source

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,530
contribution and rewarding it for

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:22,630
employees either by factoring it into

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,679
the high the promotion process or

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,550
factoring it into their incentives I

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,679
personally feel strongly that that's a

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,179
bad model because there are some people

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,559
who don't want to participate an

00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:34,660
open-source and if their only path to

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,520
getting promoted is to force them into

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,410
open source that actually creates some

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,440
problems and I'll dig into what those

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,750
problems are in just a little bit so

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,400
hiring based on a github activity isn't

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,250
just inaccurate because it misses all of

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,470
these things I will go a little further

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,020
to say that hiring just based on github

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:57,809
activity is wrong and I mean wrong in

00:17:53,020 --> 00:18:01,330
this sense morally so open-source

00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:03,340
participation can be problematic for any

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,300
number of groups of people there are

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,850
some communities that are very

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,170
challenging to participate in this is

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,370
getting better over time but I think we

00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:13,390
can replace the work challenging with

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:15,520
toxic communities where maybe the

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,220
language or the framework or the stack

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,080
that you know the best the community is

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,450
not welcoming or at least not welcoming

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,850
to you and participating in that

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,770
community costs you emotionally more

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,360
than you get out of it but you should

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,870
not be forced into participating in that

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,309
community right there are communication

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,360
barriers that can add friction and I

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:37,660
think this is especially relevant

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,330
outside the US if someone is maintaining

00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,740
an open-source project in the US and all

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,870
of their contributors are English and

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,730
English is your first is not your first

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,010
language and maybe not even your second

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,570
and maybe not even your third you're

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,540
going to be less likely to be able to

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:55,150
get your pull requests landed and some

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,860
merged than people who are able to

00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,560
communicate more effectively in English

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,290
this also like adds int when you add

00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,380
into that the time delay that's involved

00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:07,110
in time differences from you know this

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,910
side of the world to the other

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:12,250
communication barriers like that can

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,750
really make it difficult to participate

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,630
on even footing with other members of

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:20,320
the community and so your work might be

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:22,870
be prioritized so that's another reason

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,960
that it can be wrong

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:29,620
cultural norms can be intimidating I'm a

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,060
pretty reasonably grounded person but

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,030
even now when I go to make a

00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:36,640
contribution to open an issue to open a

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,620
pull request on a project that I've not

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,700
been to for the first time I spend a lot

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,660
of time trying to figure out if I'm

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,890
going to get it wrong or if I'm gonna

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,190
get yelled at or if I'm gonna put my

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,020
foot in my mouth right when you don't

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,820
know how to navigate the community

00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,170
because you haven't before it can be a

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,430
little intimidating to take that first

00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:58,480
step but I want to focus a little bit on

00:19:54,430 --> 00:20:01,510
this idea of time and call back to the

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,680
idea of participating in open source on

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:07,750
your free time I don't there's a there's

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,890
an outstanding question and it one of

00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,410
the reasons it's outstanding is because

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,150
it's moving over time of how much open

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,560
source and how many contributions to

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,570
free and open source software come from

00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,250
people who are paid to do it versus

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,040
people who do it because they love to do

00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,740
it right we've seen a lot of numbers

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,780
thrown around over time you know what is

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,090
the ratio of paid versus non paid

00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,430
freedom source developers I didn't have

00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:33,970
an answer to that so I did what any

00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:35,980
reasonable American tech guy would do I

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,650
just read half a blog post to put up a

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,970
Twitter poll and I asked for those of

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,320
you who participate in open source

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,320
communities which of these is the most

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,080
true I do it on company time or I do it

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,550
on my own time and two-thirds of the

00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,310
people who respond to this said they did

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,570
it on their own time well that's you

00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,890
know two-thirds of a hundred and

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,929
eighty-eight people so maybe not

00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,520
useful piece of data but we know there's

00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:00,380
something there let's come back to

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,130
digital ocean currents do you write code

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:06,710
as a hobby or a profession and 63% of

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,410
the people said both eighteen percent

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:12,260
said as a hobbyist fourteen percent said

00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:15,410
proficient professionally okay so at

00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,510
least 63 percent some percentage of

00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,570
their free time plays into it we just

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:22,670
don't know how much right a couple years

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,630
ago github ran the open source survey

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,080
this one got fifty five hundred

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:30,530
responses it's gonna be fairly github

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,120
biased in the data set but they knowing

00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,100
some of the methodology that they put

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,490
into it they really tried to get honest

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,980
good answers to this data when they ran

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,520
the open source survey so fifty five

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,650
hundred responses virtually all 94% of

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,299
those who are employed use open source

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,160
at least sometimes in their professional

00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:51,590
work eighty-one percent use it

00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,620
frequently and sixty-five percent of

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:56,510
those who contribute back do so as part

00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,960
of their work duties I'm gonna say that

00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,730
again

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,380
sixty-five percent of people who

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,610
contribute to open source do it as part

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,730
of their work according to this survey

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:08,960
that means 35 percent don't they're only

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:11,059
doing it on their own time and I've said

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,200
a few times free time I don't know about

00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:14,330
the rest of you

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,940
I think free time is like free money and

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,470
I don't have any free money so I don't

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,020
have free free time what I actually have

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:24,200
is personal time and the idea of

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,330
personal time is something that the tech

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,510
community as a whole has continued to

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:31,429
approach encroach on over time I think

00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,410
it's very important that your personal

00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:35,480
time is personal you have the time that

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,429
you need for work you have the time that

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,260
you need for recovery and then you have

00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:43,669
the time that you get to do whatever you

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:46,850
want to write this is why in in Silicon

00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:49,010
Valley if I see a job opportunity that

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,290
someone advertises that we have chefs on

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,270
hand for dinner that's not a perk that

00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,669
the red flag that means they want you

00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:01,460
working at the office past dinner time

00:22:55,669 --> 00:23:03,260
right so personal time is personal and

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,179
it should stay that way let's talk about

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,179
who has

00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:09,369
the most personal time well I'll give

00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:11,559
you a little bit of a spoiler the people

00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:13,779
who have the most personal time tend to

00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,210
be young tend to be male and tend to be

00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:19,269
white they look a lot like this if this

00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:22,450
is your life if you're you know a single

00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:24,070
young man of reasonable affluence of

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,480
course you can spend eight hours at work

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,330
working on code in eight hours at home

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,619
working on code right you're not too far

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,480
from this looking like your life these

00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:34,240
people have so much time they paint blue

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,950
tuxedos on them right as part of a

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,330
sports game you're young you're in

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,639
college you've got all kinds of free

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,159
time right you've got all kinds of

00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:44,470
personal time but if this is your life

00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,539
if you're raising a family mmm

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,980
the the older people in this picture

00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:50,080
don't have any free time they don't any

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,840
personal time by the time the kids are

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,460
in bed it's just enough time to kind of

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,289
recover and get ready to go to bed

00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,259
yourself you don't get a lot if this is

00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:02,350
your life if you're a single parent with

00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:04,029
a couple of kids personal time is is is

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,730
just doesn't it's not going to exist for

00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:08,590
18 years for you if this is your life if

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:11,200
you are you know primarily responsible

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,999
for elder care you don't have a lot of

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,429
personal time and what personal time you

00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:19,240
do has go well personal time you have

00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:21,340
goes into this role this isn't just you

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,769
know me talking about it the UN Economic

00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,159
Commission for Europe broke down across

00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:29,619
a wide range of countries who has time

00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,389
for free time and other activities TV

00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:34,179
video games and then other free time

00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:36,490
activities and country-by-country it is

00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:38,320
men who have disproportionate free time

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:41,769
when compared to women and this is

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,269
because in general the same report women

00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:45,070
tend to disproportionately bear

00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:49,840
responsibility for household duties

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:52,149
right so not everybody has the same

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,559
ability of free time your free time is

00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:54,999
your personal time and how you spend it

00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:57,610
is how you choose to spend it and this

00:24:54,999 --> 00:25:00,490
is why I contend that using github

00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:02,289
activity or open source participation as

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,240
a primary filter during the hiring

00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:05,409
process is wrong because if you won't

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,480
consider a candidate who doesn't

00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:09,129
participate in open source and some

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,440
candidates can't participate in open

00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:13,029
source because of external forces you

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,680
are trying to lay claim to their

00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:17,660
personal time that doesn't along

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,420
to you it biases against a whole

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,960
category of people your personal time is

00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,550
not yours

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,860
don't we'll come back to the summary of

00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:28,760
the talk don't use this as the primary

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:31,760
as a primary filter during hiring now

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,890
what are you supposed to do because I've

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,390
I've tried to build what I think is a

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:39,320
compelling case on why you shouldn't do

00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:43,580
this but I haven't given you any tips I

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,620
want to talk first to people who find

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,350
themselves in the position of being

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,490
evaluated for hiring alright I want to

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,740
try to give you some tools that will

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,270
help you advocate for yourself and I'm

00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,660
not gonna lie and I can't really

00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:59,090
sugarcoat it this is kind of hard to do

00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:02,120
it's intimidating walking into an

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:04,910
interview and also feeling like you need

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,140
to do anything other than just try to

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,240
make the person on the other side of the

00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,650
table happy right but advocating

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,360
yourself is not impossible it can just

00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,190
be challenging part of this is just

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,770
knowing the language if you understand

00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,810
that this whole thing is happening

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:19,820
behind the scenes it gives you the

00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,770
ability to deal with the problem in a

00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,450
way that maybe you couldn't before know

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,700
that this is what recruiters look for

00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,310
and have an answer don't get caught

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,170
flat-footed when a recruiter says hey

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:32,750
you know we looked at your github but we

00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:35,390
didn't see any activity so what's the

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,390
deal explain your constraints right and

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:40,700
that could just be as simple as saying

00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:42,620
it as having an answer ready to give

00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,940
that says these are the other things

00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,460
that I'm involved in and this is where I

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,050
might spend my time or this is not where

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,420
I choose to spend my time I don't like

00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,340
to code you know 24 hours a day when I

00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:55,580
get home I like to read or go hiking or

00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,680
get away from the computer and if that

00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,300
answer isn't acceptable to the employer

00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,190
that you're talking to if they're

00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,320
looking for people who eat breathe and

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,510
sleep code that should be a signal to

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,490
you that they don't want people who eat

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,940
speak and breathe code they want people

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:13,010
who eat speak and breathe their code

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:15,560
right they they they aren't gonna be as

00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,270
excited about someone just because they

00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,040
make a lot of alph our contributions to

00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,330
open source the expectation is going to

00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,760
be that you will continue to do that

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,290
work for them in the off hours and

00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,290
consider yourself lucky to have avoided

00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,429
that so have an answer for whatever your

00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,110
constraints are

00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:32,360
or whatever your decision has been feel

00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,460
free to offer them coat samples in most

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,710
cases even if you've only been doing

00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,289
internal work there is code that you

00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:42,289
have worked on that you can share in the

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:44,090
process of the interview process in the

00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:45,559
process of being interviewed so that

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,570
they can see what the code looks like

00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,710
without actually giving it to them if

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,539
you've got to print it out and take it

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,669
in so they can look at it that I think

00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:54,200
they will understand I can't share this

00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:55,700
with you because it's under NDA or I

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,049
can't show you this what's internal but

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:04,039
here's what some of my code looks like

00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:05,899
right I would say that sometimes I have

00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:07,820
heard people given the advice that

00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:11,769
anything on github is better than

00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:14,360
nothing so create a project of your own

00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:16,190
my perspective as a hiring manager and

00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,789
as a people as a person who looks at the

00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:22,340
candidates if I see vanity github

00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:24,169
projects where you've decided you want

00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,970
to make your own forum software as a

00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,320
thought experiment that tells me

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,230
slightly more than nothing

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,860
but if you're investing significantly on

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:35,389
trying to create something new I'm I

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,220
would wonder why you're not spending

00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:38,659
that same amount of time also being

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:42,350
involved in the open-source projects do

00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:43,700
you use right I think vanity github

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,580
projects are better than nothing but

00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,200
don't force something into github just

00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,179
to try to make it look good for other

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,340
people because in some cases can

00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:54,230
actually end up looking bad by all means

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,730
if you have a thing that you love that

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,429
you're building on github and it's your

00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,019
own thing that's not forcing it right

00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:01,549
you're creating something that you love

00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:02,960
but don't put something up just to put

00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:07,009
something up because it's gonna look

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,570
like a fairly low quality code anyway I

00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:10,850
also think it's very important to

00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,379
recognize your value hiring managers in

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,059
the room put your hands up again people

00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:15,440
are responsible for hiring keep your

00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:18,740
hand up if you think hiring is super

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,220
easy not a hand stayed up in the room

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:24,619
right individuals in the room who are

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,119
not hiring managers who are working or

00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:28,879
aspire to work in the software industry

00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:30,919
the power is in your hands right there

00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:32,690
are not enough of you if there were

00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:35,690
hiring would be easier

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:39,739
all right hiring is hard understand that

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:41,090
and know what your value is but it's not

00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:43,009
just about knowing that there are not

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:45,950
enough of you you really need to

00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:47,929
recognize what you're doing well and

00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,840
I'll touch on that briefly in a moment

00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:52,580
so since there are not enough of you

00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,440
filter out those needing employers

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,749
filter out the employers who you think

00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,220
are going to be expecting you to answer

00:29:56,749 --> 00:30:00,529
emails at night eight o'clock at night

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:03,919
and writing code at midnight right if

00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:06,529
that's your thing if you love your job

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,759
so much that you go home and you keep

00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:10,970
working on it and you work into the

00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:14,269
night and it brings you joy no one

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:16,820
should stand in your way right and there

00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:19,009
I have magically turned into this kind

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,539
of person over the last few months over

00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:24,529
the program that's not writing code it's

00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:26,239
usually writing documents and but no

00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:30,049
one's expecting it of me my employer is

00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:32,119
not expecting them me you some people

00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:33,049
just like to work in that mode and you

00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,950
should feel free to there's nothing

00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:36,499
wrong with that

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,479
right but if your employer is expecting

00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:40,909
it that is the thing that I think that

00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:42,799
you should filter out I also think it's

00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:45,080
important to know when you are at your

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,690
best no really no the things that you do

00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,629
well I thought for a long time that I

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,190
knew what I did well I was wrong just

00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:55,940
about on every case and I'm probably

00:30:52,190 --> 00:31:00,830
wrong about it now you have a set of

00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:02,479
skills right and maybe what you can do

00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,309
well is you can write really really well

00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:05,450
formed a code that's easy for other

00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:07,309
people to understand that it's very

00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:09,229
elegant that might not actually be your

00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:11,960
strength your actual strength might be

00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:13,759
finding really really weird creative

00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,779
solutions in code that no one in their

00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,330
right mind would ever deploy in

00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:18,409
production but solve the problem in a

00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,029
way that no one else has been able to

00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:24,529
solve before maybe that's your strength

00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:26,659
all right the only way to really know

00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:28,909
what you're best at and to know when you

00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:30,470
are at your best is to go through a

00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:33,529
process that I like to think of as

00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:36,529
ruthless introspection you need to sit

00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:39,139
down with yourself and your work and

00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:40,519
really spend some time looking at it and

00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:42,110
being honest with yourself about the

00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,370
things that you're good at

00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,160
honest with yourself about the things

00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:49,670
that you're bad at speaking personally I

00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,200
had a very hard time recognizing the

00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:53,450
things that I was bad at and I had an

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,250
even harder time admitting that I was

00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,040
bad at those things especially to other

00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,360
people until I sat down and actually

00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,460
figured out what the things were that I

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,590
was good at and that I could bring to

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,049
situations if you can articulate those

00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,790
during the hiring process it

00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:10,040
demonstrates a kind of self-awareness

00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:12,740
that most candidates don't come into the

00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,480
process with you'll sometimes get a

00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,210
question you know tell me what your bad

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,559
tell me you're your worst mistake and

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,880
there's a temptation to downplay that

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,309
embrace it know what you're bad at

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,809
because it's gonna make you better too

00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:28,460
better able to talk about the things

00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:30,049
that you're good at but while you're

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,910
doing this process of ruthless

00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:33,730
introspection I also want you to

00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,940
practice fierce compassion for yourself

00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,250
all right

00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,780
this introspection is not a process for

00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,280
you to find all the reasons that you're

00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,380
not qualified for the job you want to

00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,450
get it is a process for you to find out

00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,910
why you are qualified what your

00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,169
strengths are be kind to yourself when

00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,270
you're looking at the things that you

00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:52,250
know are just not your best areas or the

00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,320
areas in which you want to develop so

00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:57,860
ruthless introspection always pure

00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,140
parrot with fierce compassion and that

00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,730
will again give you the ability to play

00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,450
to your strengths don't paper over your

00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,620
weaknesses

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:05,840
don't try to hand wave over your

00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,130
weaknesses if there's things you can't

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,140
do well they're gonna come out in the

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,320
first three to six months of your

00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:15,080
employment anyway like they're gonna

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,059
come out right talk about what your

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,360
strengths are and be honest about your

00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:22,190
weaknesses also finding a mentor who is

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,190
who has heard someone say hey find a

00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,630
mentor a bunch of people okay yeah who

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,809
knows how to

00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:35,570
no hands yeah like maybe one hand maybe

00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:39,890
one hand right advice on finding a

00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:41,390
mentor look for someone who you think is

00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,130
further along in their career that can

00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,860
give you good advice on how to get to

00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:49,030
your next step right if you're looking

00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:52,510
for if I was looking for a mentor

00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:56,150
because I wanted to be a CEO someday I

00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:57,830
that's a massive massive step to try to

00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,390
find somebody to take me that far I need

00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,640
to find somebody to take me to the next

00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:04,100
step in my journey like what's going to

00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,409
get me a little closer and when you ask

00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,210
for someone when you ask someone to give

00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:10,879
you mentorship be specific about what

00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:14,899
you're asking for right will you be my

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:17,359
mentor sure what are we talking about I

00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:18,560
can't help you with that right in much

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,129
the same way that when you ask for

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,480
feedback on something yeah I'm gonna I'm

00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:25,460
gonna pick on you for just a moment here

00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,409
so I'm giving my talk you and I are good

00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:32,000
friends we're old friends right how am i

00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:33,200
doing great that's what your friends are

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,379
always gonna say that's what anybody's

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,409
always gonna say how am i doing great

00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:41,570
let me try something else I'm a English

00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:43,520
as a first language speaker I tend to

00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,139
speak very quickly how well do you think

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,010
I'm pacing my language so that I could

00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,010
be understood by the room

00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,240
okay that was super useful feedback

00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:00,430
right because I after specifically what

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,190
I wanted feedback on and for those who

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,210
don't have English as a first language I

00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,640
struggle with this all the time I'm a

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,170
fast speaker if there's anything I was

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,310
unclear on please catch me afterwards

00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,660
and I'll unpack as well so when you find

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,340
a mentor when you're looking for a

00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,860
mentor be specific about what you want

00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,690
them to do for you and be specific about

00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,370
those conversations if you want help

00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:24,510
trying to find one I will be more than

00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:26,740
happy at least to try to help you find

00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,360
other ways that you can advocate for

00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:31,570
yourself as you can seek paid

00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:33,670
contribution work if if the constraint

00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,200
that you're under is that the time that

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,020
you have available needs to be put into

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,910
time that generates income for you or

00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,340
your family there are ways that you can

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,690
seek paid contribution work out Ricci is

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,010
a program run by software freedom

00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,480
Conservancy that provides paid

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,160
internships for people to make their

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,430
first contributions to open-source

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,900
projects I see that thank you

00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,880
there are bug bounty programs I believe

00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:58,300
hacker one has a pretty good one where

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,650
you can collect bug bounties on bugs

00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,990
that are open on open source projects

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:05,380
there are another number of companies

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:08,230
that will offer paid internship as part

00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:10,000
of the hiring process I don't know if we

00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:12,190
want to hire you full time or not take a

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,840
couple weeks contract and let's see how

00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,940
it works out I know honeycomb IO does

00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,530
this not everybody's in a position you

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,200
can take advantage of that that can be a

00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,000
little hard especially if you need to

00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,860
have the next job in hand before you let

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,350
go of the last one but there aren't paid

00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,370
internships available that can lead out

00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,410
there are also some fellowships

00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,420
available through Mozilla and the Ford

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,580
Foundation so there are ways out there

00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,820
to seek paid contribution work and that

00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,080
can be a better way to build up your

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,290
open-source profile and to give you the

00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,560
ability to have

00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:44,420
so with that I'm gonna I'm gonna switch

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,170
to talking to the hiring managers in the

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,240
room

00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:50,860
and ultimately I just want to encourage

00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:53,330
you to look at candidates another way

00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,530
rather than interviewing for fit I want

00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:59,660
you to think about interviewing for

00:36:54,530 --> 00:37:02,480
growth I'm gonna go to a report that is

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:07,610
probably fairly biased toward American

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:10,160
data it was run by Gallup research and

00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:11,960
the basic question was how important our

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,770
growth of opportunities in your next

00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,420
role and so I'll read out here gallops

00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:20,240
really to support how Millennials want

00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,370
to work and live reveals that 59% of

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,740
Millennials say opportunities to learn

00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:26,630
and grow are extremely important to them

00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:30,260
when applying for a job

00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,700
comparatively 44% of Gen Xers and 41% to

00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,700
baby boomers seeing the same thing about

00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,160
those types of opportunities so Gen X

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:39,320
44% I care about growth

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,570
Millennials 59% I care about the

00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,980
opportunity to grow if you're looking at

00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:45,740
a candidate who doesn't have open source

00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:48,070
contribution history that's a fantastic

00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,150
opportunity to gift him to grow right

00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,830
look for the opportunity look for

00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:54,500
reasons to say yes to that candidate to

00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:58,640
bring them in and then help them to grow

00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,780
in that area I also want you to be very

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,060
conscious that you're treating your

00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,610
candidates fairly so if you have a

00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:07,640
candidate that you're evaluating and

00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,440
they have that prolific github profile

00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,960
and you decide you want to talk to him

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,030
that's fine if you have a candidate that

00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,040
you want to evaluate they look strong

00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:18,650
but they don't have any github activity

00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:22,310
start asking them for some alternatives

00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:24,560
or providing alternatives to them if you

00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,850
want to look at their open source work

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,010
and evaluate them and they don't have

00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,290
any offer them a panel interview ask

00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,060
them for code samples offer to do a

00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,440
reverse code review have them come in

00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,210
and sit down with an engineer who wrote

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,980
some code and they review the code for

00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,450
the engineer they're gonna get a little

00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,750
more insight into how their brain works

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:43,520
through that process as opposed to just

00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,290
looking at their things you can give

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,080
them a take home programming exercise I

00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:49,340
have very mixed feelings about this

00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,779
because this is just another version of

00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:53,839
trying to lay claim to someone's purse

00:38:50,779 --> 00:38:55,969
time so you know if you give them a

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,609
take-home programming exercise and it's

00:38:55,969 --> 00:39:00,109
a couple hours long that's probably

00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:01,669
reasonable if you give them a take-home

00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:03,469
programming exercise it's gonna take

00:39:01,669 --> 00:39:08,299
them a week to complete you have to pay

00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:09,829
them or don't do that right even if it's

00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:11,119
you know more than just a couple of

00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:12,529
hours you should really be thinking

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,459
about what the what the end result is

00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:19,039
their offer them contract work again you

00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:20,719
you might have features in an open

00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,969
source project of your own that you want

00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:25,969
to have them committed rather than

00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:27,319
bringing them in as an employee and not

00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:28,579
knowing how well they're gonna work out

00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:30,319
of open sources of things that you care

00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:33,289
about offer them a paid contract to

00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:36,259
implement a feature right you will get a

00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:38,029
lot of exposure to how how they work and

00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:38,390
get more of a sense for what they're

00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:41,739
like

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:45,619
again that won't work for everyone and

00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:46,969
the idea is to have a diversity of

00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:49,669
options that you've already thought

00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:53,569
about when you don't see what you're

00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:57,140
looking for think about open source

00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:58,130
activity and github activity as a signal

00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,900
that you're getting from a candidate

00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,219
right if you're if you have another

00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,509
candidate that is not giving you any

00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:04,159
signal you just have to find another

00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:07,909
place that that signal can come from

00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:10,009
okay so treat your kids that it's fairly

00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:11,869
to wrap up I contend that github

00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:13,609
activity is a bad indicator and hiring

00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:15,650
we should stop using it bad in this case

00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:17,209
means it tells us things that it does

00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,029
not intend to tell us it does not tell

00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:21,469
us what we wanted to tell us this is

00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:23,719
because not everyone participates an

00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:25,339
open-source in the same way not everyone

00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:27,409
has the same time constraints in the

00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,949
same time opportunities to contribute to

00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:30,890
open source

00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:32,689
I want candidates who find themselves in

00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,279
this position to advocate for themselves

00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:37,339
and I hope I've given you some ways that

00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:39,769
you can do that and hiring managers I

00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:44,179
want you to offer candidates alternative

00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:46,519
evaluations of equal weight if you give

00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:49,339
them a take-home exercise and it comes

00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:50,509
back you need to evaluate that using the

00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:53,380
same amount of weight that you would

00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:55,660
evaluate their github activity right

00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,160
you can't give them a take-home exercise

00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,199
and say well they did great on the

00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,459
exercise but they didn't have any github

00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,739
activity so we're gonna biased toward

00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:04,829
that thing treat them with equal weight

00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:07,119
and with that I believe we've got

00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,499
between four and seven minutes for

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,869
questions depending on whose timer we

00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:16,239
look at okay actually we are a little

00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:18,779
bit ahead of time but we can take one or

00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:18,779
two questions

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,710
thank you doing yes I Melvin adventure

00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,660
I'm wondering when you asked just now

00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:33,210
how many of you have heard the word

00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,770
clock before do you mean Cielo UT

00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,720
because I would have put up my hand had

00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,770
used spelled it with a c' brain

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,230
according to merriam-webster's

00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:43,800
dictionary I have an ad mm-hmm it's

00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:47,190
spelt with C right and the startup spot

00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,710
it with a K presumably because CLO ut

00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:53,250
calm was not available but KL o UT was

00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:55,950
so thank you

00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:59,580
just to refresh changed the first one is

00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:03,240
like in my history I saw people who

00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:05,550
stole other open source code rename the

00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,010
packages and then put it on the github

00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:10,470
and pretend it as their own work and

00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:14,700
actually there are companies who

00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:17,400
actually you build your github profile

00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:20,850
for paid I mean YouTube pay them cash

00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,670
and then they make a new projects just

00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:28,850
to and contribute it just as like your

00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:31,320
own so and that is right like github is

00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:35,100
as you said it's not a good indicator

00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:38,070
but the problem behind it's like we are

00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:40,859
talking about hiring managers and people

00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:42,570
have to do HR screenings and HR people

00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,590
would usually they don't know about

00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:46,380
codings

00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:49,140
unless you have to send all works to the

00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,210
technical guys to review so what what

00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:56,400
kind of like suggestion can you give to

00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:59,790
those non tech HR managers or staff to

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,810
scream out empower employees or

00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:05,880
candidates sure so the first thing I'll

00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:09,119
make sure that we know is that people

00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,650
who do just copy library code out of

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,100
open-source projects and call it their

00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:13,080
owner

00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:17,580
well it'll license violation already

00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:19,350
right and they would those libraries

00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,940
probably would show with very low

00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:24,869
activity

00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:27,589
and I would encourage people to look at

00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:29,730
low activity github projects in an

00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:31,710
individual's personal repo the same way

00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,380
you look at a vanity project if there's

00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:36,839
no collaboration it there's there's open

00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,390
code maybe with license but may not be

00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:41,940
open-source as far as advice for hiring

00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:44,250
managers on how to give HR guidance for

00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:47,339
non-technical people to navigate the

00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:50,760
screening process to avoid situations

00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:54,990
like that if you're working with the

00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:58,140
recruiter your recruiter is not likely

00:43:54,990 --> 00:44:00,720
to be familiar or deeply familiar with

00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,790
your own nuance technical space right

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,670
they might understand the process of

00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:07,290
sourcing candidates to come in or going

00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:10,200
out and finding people they think would

00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:12,810
be ideal it is important to have this

00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,520
explicit conversation right like I'm not

00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,619
looking for people with github activity

00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,180
if they have a github profile great but

00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,130
if not that doesn't mean we throw the

00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:23,099
candidate out look at some of their past

00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:25,650
other roles to see if the roles that

00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:27,690
they have held to date look like they

00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,970
might be able to perform this role as

00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:32,040
well unfortunately this means you have

00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,420
to cast kind of a broad net maybe a

00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,910
broader net than you'd like to and

00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,160
believe me when you're when you're when

00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:40,440
hiring it's already hard right having to

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,810
go through twice as many resumes to

00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,160
figure out if you think someone is a fit

00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:47,160
it means more time investment on your

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,930
part as the hiring manager if you take

00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,270
the role seriously I think you have to

00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,740
do that work right so making sure that

00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:54,720
the candidates are not getting filtered

00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,000
out above you by this by being explicit

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,490
about that requirement or the lack of

00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,520
that requirement is is one thing that

00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:04,080
you do

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:08,090
are we at time are there more questions

00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,090
maybe last question last question

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,859
you dropped that phrase hiring people

00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:16,409
who don't want to contribute to a free

00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:18,539
software open source I think a little

00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:20,249
bit issue of that because there's a

00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:25,109
difference between not one thing and not

00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:27,959
being able to if I have a corporate open

00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:30,779
source project that then I'm looking for

00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:33,929
people who understand the community and

00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:36,779
who can help me push that project into

00:45:33,929 --> 00:45:40,309
the community and and I may not have the

00:45:36,779 --> 00:45:42,749
resource and time to train people in

00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:44,009
community work I can train developers

00:45:42,749 --> 00:45:46,429
but I cannot train them in community

00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:51,169
work because that's a whole different

00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:53,609
kind of thing that needs to be done and

00:45:51,169 --> 00:46:00,179
so I don't know how to how to deal with

00:45:53,609 --> 00:46:02,249
that so let me give an example a couple

00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:07,799
of examples that maybe will help clarify

00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:10,529
that and to start from the foundation

00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:12,269
that I don't think everybody has to

00:46:10,529 --> 00:46:13,409
participate in open-source I don't think

00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,789
everybody wants to and I don't think

00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:16,499
anybody should be put in a position

00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:19,679
where they feel like they are forced to

00:46:16,499 --> 00:46:21,569
write developers can work on projects

00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,609
that are internal facing only and be

00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:25,549
great developers and never be in a

00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:27,689
position that they would they could

00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:29,579
write there would be opportunity for

00:46:27,689 --> 00:46:31,799
them but I don't think we have to force

00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:34,140
them into that but again if they are

00:46:31,799 --> 00:46:36,329
being forced into a community that is

00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,130
not going to be receptive to them you're

00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:40,979
then you're putting emotional labor on

00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:43,229
the candidate right for example if the

00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:45,089
if the project that they're working on

00:46:43,229 --> 00:46:47,429
that is internal that touches some piece

00:46:45,089 --> 00:46:49,109
of for your open source software if the

00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,939
community around that project has

00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:53,309
demonstrated the inability to work

00:46:50,939 --> 00:46:54,900
effectively with people who are several

00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:58,019
time zones in the future or in the past

00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:00,089
or who are not able to navigate their

00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:02,279
their language or their cultural norms

00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:03,359
you're basically putting stress on the

00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:05,189
individual to figure that out for

00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,329
themselves when there is a community

00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:10,380
problem on the other end that they can't

00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:12,989
solve right and so that's not gonna be a

00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,369
good experience for them if you take as

00:47:12,989 --> 00:47:15,630
another example someone who's already

00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:17,200
been through that experience and I've

00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:19,510
talked to another and number

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,040
Engineers who've done this you know hey

00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:23,369
I made an open-source contribution once

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,890
it was terrible I'll never do it again

00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:30,089
okay like if that's where you want to be

00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:32,740
I will take you where you are there I

00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:35,109
hope over time that I encourage you just

00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:38,829
a little closer to making maybe a tiny

00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:41,140
good of contribution and helping work

00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:42,190
through that again so I know you've got

00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,510
your hand up I'll be happy to talk to

00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:47,829
you afterwards I'm looking to you for

00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:51,310
time I thank you okay if you have more

00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:52,720
questions I think you will be around

00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,000
here I know me around I'm actually

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,820
headed straight to the booth downstairs

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,980
company to the hallway briefly yeah get

00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:02,530
you in and ask you a question

00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:06,720
so let's give a big round of applause

00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:06,720
