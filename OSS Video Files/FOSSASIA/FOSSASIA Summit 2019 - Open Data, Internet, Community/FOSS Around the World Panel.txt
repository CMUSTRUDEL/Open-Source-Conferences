00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,890
connections between us I believe that we

him cousin you know I have the same

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,380
sense that we have been in a lot of the

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,240
same events but just have not managed to

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,920

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,380
more interestingly you had a very

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:41,280
international paper and Michael you were

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:44,040

the u.s. spent over 10 years in China

00:04:44,040 --> 00:05:02,100
Thailand Japan Myanmar Hong Kong it's

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,690
hard to say maybe 10 years from now I'll

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,490
figure that answer out when I'm sitting

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,740
in a therapists office but I do like to

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:15,450
travel so it is what it is I actually

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,160
just spoke at FOSDEM a while back and as

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,430
it was probably my second time around

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,810
the circuit and so Dwayne I just came

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,820
from the open source Leadership Summit

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,350
so I went to FOSDEM I went to a lot of

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,330
other conference we went to the Linux

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:32,150
Foundation of a source event I came here

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:34,850
and yeah we much we much prefer Fausto

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,410
let's just put it that way

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:44,729
but as compared to the open source

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:46,919
leader yes no yes yes and this is this

00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:50,250
is completely off-topic but what you

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,650
were asking me but this feels much more

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,900
like like home you know the conference

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:58,020
is like this right like that Fossum they

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,580
had a they had the bouncers at delirium

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,800
cafe who'd ask you the questions and

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,260
that was just the coolest thing ever

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:09,419
right so which question did he get so I

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,350
got I got the first three questions

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,800
wrong

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,720
and then they asked me was the most

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,060
what's what's the next stable release of

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,600
Debian and I do raspberry-pi stuff a lot

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,740
so I knew that answer is Buster right

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,850
but but the first three questions I got

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,040
wrong because I'm not technical enough

00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,030
but at least at least I got in it and it

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,990
felt earned I hit felt like I belong

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:37,170
which was like like a very cool feeling

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:39,180
so I think I first got into contact with

00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,920
you about two months before the boss is

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,570
awesome it when you said that Facebook

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,670
really interested to find out more to

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,740
learn about boss Asia and also the first

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,890
time a Facebook became one of ours one

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,230
said oh and I'd really like Michael Oh

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,700
in a way that when he communicated with

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,040
us I don't feel that we talked to a

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,140
sponsor so I feel that hatred like a

00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,810
community members I can't share with him

00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,990
anything I can tell him our difficulty

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,060
and talk openly about expectations or is

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,630
it something I'd really like I did not

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,340
as my company like Facebook would be so

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,970
open and collaborative so thank you very

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:17,400
much for me for being here thank you

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:20,580

fabulous here for this session so before

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:32,409
I start with my first question I would

00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,270
like to encourage you to openly share

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,740

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,020

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,479
please feel free to speak to each other

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,430
I understand for most of you this is the

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:48,670
first time we get to know each other as

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:51,040
well okay so to kick things off I love

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,680
to ask each of your speaker here to tell

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,870
us what brought you to open source in

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,950
the first place what is your current

00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:02,560
roles and responsibilities in the first

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:06,310
organization or project that you involve

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,440
quiz and finally please tell us some

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:13,720
things that most people don't know about

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,880
you yeah so how about let's start with

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,430
Prairie

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,080
well first you to force them what what

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:26,290
are your main responsibilities now in

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:29,620
the organization with the network team

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,690
in Folsom someone said hey come and join

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,070
this event help organize it it will be

00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:41,620
fun it won't take too much of your time

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:43,930
that was a lie a blatant lie I've moved

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,850
on through the organization doing many

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:50,770
different things just helping out her

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:53,320
hands were needed and finally well the

00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:56,260
last few years I've been very busy doing

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,170
video because well the scale of her

00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,750
event really calls for a very specific

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,090
solution

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,450
but I've also been doing many other

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:10,700
things within the organization i

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,850
partially do sponsorships i do general

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,610
question-answering

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,310
i still part of the program committee

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,280
for some bits of the of the program that

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:24,560
we run so that's why I wrote that I wear

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:27,000
many hats within the organization and

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:32,040
yeah I see your question what brought me

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,360
into open source as I have been using a

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:39,360
computer since the mid 90s I think and

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,000
as every child of the mid 90s in a

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,690
western country I was given a Windows

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,160
computer and I felt very unsatisfied

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,740
with what I always able to do

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,910
I broke the thing many many times and I

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,430
was trying to understand how the

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,410
computer actually worked but I saw that

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,410
I was more working with a specific

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,550
operating system rather than

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,710
understanding how the computer was was

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,090
actually working I'm so I was looking

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,600
for something you know and then I

00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:13,380
stumbled upon Linux and installed pretty

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,810
much all of the distributions and find

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,790
some I liked and kept on using that and

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,710
that's how it all started and it felt

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,140
very comfortable and then I learned and

00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,900
it's only done that I learned about the

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,660
the principles behind all of it the the

00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,450
idea of the spirit and the community

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:35,040
feeling and I was absolutely charmed by

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:36,960
it all so that's why I stayed before we

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,960
go on to the next thing I'd really like

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,450
to call out the value that the FOSDEM

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,810
video team provides for the wider

00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,940
community if if a conference wanted to

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,300
pay to have all of their talks recorded

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,520
it would be prohibitively expensive and

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:56,250
the amount of content that your team

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,670
makes available to everyone through your

00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,200
efforts is

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,190
a tremendous gift to the community thank

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,140
you oh you're very welcome we think it's

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,710
really important to not only get the

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,820
content at the event itself and

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,920
available to you to a limited number of

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,050
people but to allow remote participation

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,970
lots of people can't make it to your

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,730
conference so it's actually great that

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,910
people engaged with your attendees

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,880
through remote participation engine we

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,970
have hackerspaces all around the world

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,640
setting up streaming events to watch the

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,990
FOSDEM livestream together for those who

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,590
can't make it to the event I think

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,980
that's absolutely fantastic to see so

00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:42,840
happy to see that it's reality

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:45,160
I'm sure if I try to rewind all the

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,720
questions in order as I as I can think

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:54,220
about it I was starting my career as

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,540
Linux was kind of exploding and I was

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,640
very young in my career and I did not

00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,040
come from a technical background I at

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,900
best like I say I came from a liberal

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,310
arts background actually went to a

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:08,380
religious college and so I spent maybe

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,530
the first two thirds of my career

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,600
feeling like I was trying to catch up to

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:17,020
technology curve that was just out of my

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,390
grasp and and kind of in the a very

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,330
typical like free open-source

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,070
contributor mindset of I'm not smart

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,370
enough to do this and there's nothing I

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,260
can add to the community right so there

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,480
were a lot of you know long nights

00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,460
chasing through dependencies trying to

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,910
get something to work in the garage and

00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:39,670
a lot of struggling with things but

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,380
overall my participation in the

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:47,530
open-source community was was fairly

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:49,390
limited there was a I think pre Bugzilla

00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:54,640
there was a bug tracker called mantis

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:57,310
that you remember mantis I think that

00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,010
was my first open source contribution to

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,970
add a flag to make it work if installed

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,339
on Windows NT so that gives

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:10,369
kind of a framework for where I was in

00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:13,220
my career and I was always working on

00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:14,809
things that were you know using a lot of

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,679
open-source technology or adjacent to

00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:17,149
other groups that we're doing

00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,309
open-source work but it wasn't really

00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,779
until I took the role at PayPal running

00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:23,599
day-to-day operations of the open source

00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:26,179
programs office where I was helping

00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:30,229
developers get their work approved by

00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:31,939
legal and sort of serving as the the

00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:33,319
open source concierge or the open source

00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,989
service man which is kind of where the

00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:38,419
jumpsuits came from trying to solve

00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:40,099
other people's problems that I really

00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,329
started to grow into the role that I

00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:43,789
have now which is head of open source

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:45,470
that indeed where I manage everything

00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:48,679
from sponsorships and involvement to

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,299
policy and designing initiatives to

00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,829
encourage people to get over that

00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:53,689
hesitation that I myself had in the

00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:57,879
beginning of making their first few

00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:57,879
contributions and getting a taste for it

00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:08,569
yeah so I guess I got out into open

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:15,379
source yeah as a kid in the mid 90s

00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:18,229
write it I think I was I was sort of I

00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:24,409
mostly weaponized computers against my

00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:28,339
parents so it was just like just fun to

00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:30,589
do that in all sorts of ways and so I

00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:34,099
think that got me got me really

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:35,720
interested in in well as part of it as

00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,249
part of that I also dropped out of high

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,009
school and I did a lot of other stuff

00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:41,359
but uh but but one of the things one of

00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:43,909
the one of the things the benefits about

00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:46,429
being alive in the mid 90s is that you

00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:49,459
know network engineering was very much a

00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:51,699
very lucrative job back then so I got

00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:55,579
into Linux through doing sysadmin

00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:57,410
and a lot of our back-end in for

00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,999
infrastructure

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,929
maintenance and so so that that's that's

00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:05,160
where probably want to some of my

00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:08,040
contribution had to do with back-end

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,819
automation things to automate IT stacks

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,610
and things like that

00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:16,350
I think I've always always been

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,119
interested in and always had this view

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,399
of the community but I've it wasn't

00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:23,759
until I sort of had more of a legal role

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,249
that I sort of came to appreciate the

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:31,139
benefits that it would bring right and I

00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:37,049
think I I see it as this kind of very

00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:42,839
unique sort of community that that that

00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:46,230
that is actually with it where the value

00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,179
is actually are more important than the

00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,279
leverage right because a lot of

00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:53,129
communities are actually based on the

00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,720
leverage of you know may not necessarily

00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:58,049
be decided company but there's other

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:02,850
things right maybe maybe the the purity

00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:04,709
of the you know the the the dogma or

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,889
some other thing right but but I think

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,269
here the community is mostly based on

00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:14,880
certain values of openness and

00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:18,449
inclusiveness I and and I think I think

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,569
the way that sort of you know the legal

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,889
the legal the sort of license the way

00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:25,620
you know that the role that licenses

00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:28,079
play within that I think is really you

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,210
know can be weaponized that in a way

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,980
that that can be you know harmful of the

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,919
community or it can be beneficial right

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,230
and you know one of the things that I

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,889
became more interested in is figuring

00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:43,289
out a way to to use the law use legal

00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:45,000
tools to safeguard the community which

00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:47,809
is something that I find this very

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,809
compelling

00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,510
that's Hollis

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,720
but dude okay that's more or less

00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,770
Stallman's sort of innovation with the

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,440
copyleft licenses which is like okay

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:04,590
copyright exists it creates an

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,300
opportunity for developers where they

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,240
individually all in corporate context to

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,910
exert power of others and then he founds

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,750
that that'll be objectionable and so yes

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,860
it was like okay let's construct

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:23,660
licenses that have the reverse effect

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:23,660
yeah I think so absolutely

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:32,280
special is something that people don't

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:37,260
know about you there are so many things

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:40,740
people don't know about me special thing

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:47,070
you know I let me think about that and

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:49,050
we'll give gift Roland his so I was a

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,630
teenager during the 80s so it was sort

00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:56,250
of Apple twos and CPM machines and

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:58,430
occasional IBM PC running dos and when I

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:02,190
arrived at University University had a

00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:05,820
armed our mainframe wedding UNIX took me

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:09,590
about 15 minutes to just like oh my god

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,730
this is this is the real thing and so

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,590
pretty quickly of course and it is much

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,540
more powerful and then what I've been

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,400
accustomed to the BBS's will fund and

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,640
that's great but the stuff that that

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,410
UNIX allows is quite extraordinary the

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,450
much simpler operating systems I was

00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,369
accustomed to

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,440
pretty quickly of course because this

00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:30,179
was at the time my the university had

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,009
one central mainframe then the school

00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,210
diffic science haven't had though so

00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:34,799
they picked some machine went to

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,499
externals but of course in both cases

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,989
admin access was clearly unavailable and

00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:41,159
that made a whole bunch of things that

00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:45,119
UNIX allowed to do what unavailable to

00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:47,820
us and so with some help from a staff

00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,220
member in suggesting involvement we set

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,809
up a program in society which to my

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,489
continuing astonishment is not only

00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:56,309
still operating it settles over at its

00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:59,720
30th birthday yesterday the party in

00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:05,609
Sydney semi-people

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:09,119
three decades eleven and so yeah we had

00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:11,820
by various ways got our hands on mini

00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:20,129
computers most mostly some equipment and

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:24,149
then by about my t2 both Torvalds early

00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:27,389
Linux was out and Joe Watts had released

00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:29,039
386bsd and so quite suddenly in about

00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:32,519
the same year later on two different

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:36,779
paths was possible to run a full Winnick

00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:38,159
full UNIX ish system on a PC and that

00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:45,029
was mind-blowing

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:48,419
so yes the ability to to study the code

00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:51,889
to improve the code machine show that

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:53,909
stuff that was really important as a

00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:56,249
rationale for open source being

00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:57,720
important but over time the other thing

00:20:56,249 --> 00:21:01,129
that I began to become aware of was

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,129
storm them constantly

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,050
sort of expressing his philosophy in a

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,370
variety of different ways began to

00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,280
notice that some of what he was saying

00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,630
was native but they these sort of

00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,700
potentially severe power imbalance

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,230
between individuals and large

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:20,260
organizations and all commercial or

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,260
government concerns me a lot and so the

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,110
my perspective is not exactly the same

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,540
as Stallman's but it's certainly very

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:30,110
heavily leaned towards the F phosphate

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,790
or more of the O's and for that reason I

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,830
work as a chief privacy officer

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,960
my role is sorting out personal data

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,330
protection issues compliance risk

00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,680
management any ethics in the context of

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,210
analytics company that analyzes data

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,420
about people in an employment context

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,100
and so I'm also talk later today about

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,740
gbbr and how do you DB our own software

00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,900
freedom are fairly closely aligned it

00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,520
remarkably was a lot in fact that so

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,160
that's the pieces sort of fit together

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,210
but yeah like most of us the path where

00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,210
was going or small piece of tortilla

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,620
what brought me to floss a sure so I

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,690
look and I guess Mario we're running for

00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:14,930
Seder in neighboring countries Vietnam

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:19,180
and Cambodia Laos maybe yes and in late

00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:21,530
2014 Hong fook came to Singapore to

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,690
explore the idea of running for station

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,560
Singapore you'd studied here right so

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,850
she was familiar with the city but

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,930
wanted to try running the conference

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,190
here and so she turned up at a weekly

00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,240
[Music]

00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:39,100
network open house I think is a better

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,570
way of saying it at JFDI which is a

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,780
technology startup accelerator program

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:47,000
that's running at the time looking for

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,040
people who are interested to support and

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,040
we met yes that's awesome

00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,080
we definitely need to do that quote this

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,490
is for me an extension of having been

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,380
publicly that setup hacker space here

00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,950
it's the same interest in being able to

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:02,530
play the technology to sort of find

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,720
people who enjoy doing this within

00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,750
sort of carries the normalization of

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,550
that events have overtaken us in ten

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,870
years of hackerspaces operation the

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,660
world has changed and Singapore has

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,340
changed faster as usual and so it's less

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:20,110
important to be sort of pasa fighting

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:21,220
that sort of approach that the to the

00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,740
whole maker supporting everything else

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,990
it's daily - it's sort of independent of

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,730
that both hackerspace but there was

00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:34,810
nothing going on that was specifically

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:37,030
pushing for encouraging development and

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,770
understanding in both prompt with the

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:42,160
free and open source elements and so

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,210
yeah spec okay this has fallen in my lap

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,870
how can I help

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:49,300
and yeah the first bits of a bit

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,040
reducing harmful to people who could

00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:54,430
provide venues to the first year we ran

00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,680
we rented a theater for the Friday track

00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,660
but we then had a bunch of people and a

00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,150
box everyone just open their premises to

00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:04,590
us to provide the breakout rooms so I

00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,590
found I think all what one of those

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:14,050
invited a minister to come and speak

00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:16,870
that was absolutely amazing support out

00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,970
as a very important members in the team

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,650
so I know that whenever I have any

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,660
problem the first person that we're

00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,700
thinking of you : and you know that at

00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,860
one point we we talk you know you say

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,290
something I would never forget so I

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:32,200
asked Roland why I used always like

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,820
willing to help other people when do you

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,740
get time for yourself but even though

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,920
he'd run a lot of project himself and he

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,740
told me that by helping other people I I

00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:44,050
can actually learn something new learn

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,210
the new way to solve the problem in the

00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:48,430
more effective way so if not for me if

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,560
not a lot so but it is the gain by

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,840
helping other people and I never forget

00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,450
that so thank you very much to continue

00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:00,010
your support to to both Asia and the

00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:02,680
organisation episode with you and moving

00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:06,850
on is always very fascinating to hear

00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,560
story of everyone here so I'm very

00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,870
curious I try to talk to as many

00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,450
speakers as possible

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:15,480
he was Asia for 200 people it's really

00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:18,120
not possible so my coin I yesterday we

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,919
thought about let's sit down and try

00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,929
together a book about people in

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,700
open-source so we hope that that will

00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:29,840
kick up in the next year or so okay so

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,789
let's move on let us now talk about

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,529
sustaining foster projects yeah

00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:41,130
so doing the day before yesterday you

00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:44,700
have a talk about sustainable project

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:47,850
rules on social I believe could you and

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,100
I'd read something one article where you

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,409
wrote the different the difference

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,039
between corporate donors in corporate

00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:57,840
sponsor yeah so in the position of

00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,470
keeping our funding for the four

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,750
projects

00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:04,500
could you please it explain a little bit

00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:06,960
about us and how what are your ideas or

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,380
such as open source project to

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,690
sustainable supporting so for context

00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,220
for people who weren't in the room for

00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,929
the talk that I gave a couple of days

00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,309
ago the sustaining Foss projects talk

00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:24,840
centered around a thing that we're

00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:26,399
trying this year where the sponsorship

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,020
dollars that we give to projects that we

00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:29,130
support are determined by people that

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,779
indeed who make open source

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,309
contributions so you make an open source

00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:35,190
contribution you vote on where the

00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:36,630
donation goes right there's a lot more

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:40,890
information about that I'm happy to talk

00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:44,850
about it afterwards but it's it's really

00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:48,720
only like a tiny piece of the problem

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:52,740
right if you look across all the

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,330
conversations and all the become the

00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,140
problems that have come up since

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,220
heartbleed and you know other projects

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,779
in the intervening time that have

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,650
expressed problems with the maintainer

00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:04,600
burnout and

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,070
you know just a very small number of

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,840
people who are doing a tremendous amount

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,780
of work trying to keep core free and

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,490
open source projects running giving them

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,309
money does it make more time it doesn't

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:18,760
reduce their burnout right and so the

00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:22,630
the long-term goal of the program that

00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,770
we're trying to build is is design we're

00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,750
trying to design the program that gets

00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:28,510
people inside the company more involved

00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,669
in the projects that we use right and

00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,620
contributing into those and helping pick

00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:34,720
up the maintenance burden and so on

00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,549
there's a fascinating metaphor at least

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,410
it's fascinating to me as I kind of look

00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:39,250
across the stage there's there's two

00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,500
people from a corporate perspective

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,880
there's our panel moderator and there's

00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,200
two people from the community and the

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,290
corporate guys have two of the mics

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,280
right so the community guys are sharing

00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,990
a mic between the two of them right it's

00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,370
it's a fascinating metaphor if you look

00:27:52,990 --> 00:28:00,510
at and this is what we have to do right

00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:03,640
no no we we have to be more involved as

00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:05,290
corporate citizens in making sure that

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,750
we're getting the community the

00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:09,820
resources it needs and sometimes that

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,290
means making sure that they have funding

00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,370
to run events and sometimes that means

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,870
they have funding to pay for

00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,330
infrastructure or to buy hardware if

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:19,960
they need it but more importantly and

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:24,400
much more importantly it means that we

00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,140
are allowing our employees to help lift

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,950
the maintenance burden for projects kind

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:31,750
of across the board that's my we had my

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:35,049
own ask me I sort of build this out of

00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,799
it a week or two back and so it'll fit

00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:40,090
off my head

00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,380
variants of that the what I suspect is

00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,890
occurring I think it's growing or keep

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,700
occurring is that the interests of

00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,290
businesses generally in larger

00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,370
organizations in particular will

00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:52,989
increasingly affect what's happening at

00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:57,349
open source

00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:59,960
part of it is the engineers are simply

00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:02,509
sitting in sort of corporate

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,129
environments and whose interests in

00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:08,509
having an efficient way to produce

00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:11,269
software well-suited by having people

00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:13,179
met evens contribute to the sort of

00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:16,399
low-level non differentiating stuff

00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:17,599
rather than the whole body middle to

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,129
your problem then go and build a

00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,739
low-grade one internally that's more

00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:28,929
costly worse less reliable West capable

00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:30,769
etc the other thirty three or four bit

00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:34,729
the other big one is that software's

00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:37,879
eating the world and that that will

00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:40,389
continue to shape various things for I

00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:42,499
would imagine a couple decades at least

00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:44,419
that means that the demand for engineers

00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:46,669
within organisations is going up in

00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:48,679
particular demand for engineers time and

00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:50,359
this thing the point about money doesn't

00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,340
provide a solution to burnout

00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:55,609
what does is corporations being able to

00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,289
reshape job roles to allow those support

00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:59,029
functions there the maintenance

00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:00,470
particular the dredge work that people

00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:02,450
would rather sort of just get done on a

00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,940
payroll than look at that's when they

00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:07,249
Wiggins doing so partly it's here let's

00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,989
encourage all of those must do it but

00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:12,320
partly I suspect that the recruiting

00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:15,139
interests of corporations will encourage

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,540
exactly that value and as until this is

00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:18,910
far back as

00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:21,669
mid 2000s with Google hiring Andrew

00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:23,110
Morton never asked him it the next

00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:24,820
converse rate of that year so what are

00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,929
you doing at Google's as well pretty

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,980
much the same thing I've doing before

00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:34,210
just anyone's a Google or a Linux kernel

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:36,880
intimate and so yeah fixing code

00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,890
connecting people occasionally doing the

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,220
talk for Google but mostly just doing

00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:43,510
the stuff he was doing and so that

00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,620
Google was doing a decade ago I suspect

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:48,730
that many more companies allow them to

00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:51,700
do much lower down the sort of thinking

00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:54,880
what if you like simply because they

00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:57,340
need to in order to recruit I'm gonna

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,710
hand the mic to you and stop talking the

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,970
the thing that I that I want to drive us

00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:07,059
toward as an entire industry is less

00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:09,280
thinking about hiring that that one like

00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:12,520
really well-known open-source engineer

00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:15,070
and more about getting all of the

00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,960
engineers doing a little bit of work on

00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,120
all the things that they touch kind of

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,520
all the time right

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,260
I think the the net lift we can get that

00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,850
for it will be much more significant and

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,460
much more beneficial to solve the

00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,960
problem but it's it's it's gonna be slow

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,240
to get there it's gonna take time but

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,650
that's the items of working down the the

00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,330
pinging old if you like that the what

00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,559
was ten years ago I sort of get a high

00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,559
profile guard to demonstrate that Google

00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:41,140
was serious it is now turning into help

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:44,919
and how do I get engineers to work for

00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:47,610
me so that I think is happening starting

00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:50,770
to happen by itself it'll develop a time

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:53,049
so join this wasn't the script we agreed

00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:57,220
on we're sitting in our back rooms with

00:31:53,049 --> 00:32:01,660
our cigars so Ted I totally agree with

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:03,870
with doing that the larger companies

00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,490
engagement really means bringing

00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,230
anything and everything that a project

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,610
needs right and I think that's what

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:13,240
doing was saying right which is not

00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:15,520
always money but deep organizational

00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,620
change right and I think one of the

00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,410
things that my organization has been

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,480
struggling with is how do we equate like

00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:25,389
github stars to

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,739
money that we pay our engineers right

00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:29,619
because that's that's really putting

00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:32,320
your money where your mouth is right you

00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:34,869
can't you're not actually incentivizing

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,389
people to move up in an organization if

00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:40,059
you're not awarding them monetarily for

00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:41,440
for contributions right but figuring out

00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,509
a good way to do that figure out a way

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,639
to do that that's meaningful as much of

00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:47,859
his very very challenging and not easy

00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:50,470
the game yeah it's very easy the game

00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:53,619
and so that's that's something that we

00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:56,440
we would like to work on right to have

00:32:53,619 --> 00:33:01,720
full-time people work on open-source and

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,950
things like that but I think when I

00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,899
think about the sustainability problem

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:07,950
I'm actually very optimistic because I

00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:10,539
feel like I feel like there's a lot of

00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,090
possible solutions out there but I feel

00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:14,559
like I also feel like that you know and

00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:17,379
this is sort of what my talk was about

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,989
but I feel like as open-source moves

00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:23,409
more into the mainstream I think people

00:33:19,989 --> 00:33:24,820
that the overwhelming majority of

00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:27,279
companies don't do open-source and

00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,919
people in the community engineers as we

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:33,190
as we as we sort of train engineers to

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,220
talk talk more sort of to sell better

00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,659
sell open-source I think I think I think

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,759
there will be more adoption at a wider

00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:41,859
variety of companies and I think that's

00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,799
the only in' i think that's vegas one of

00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:47,470
the biggest parts sort of reservoirs of

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,230
untapped potential to spread adoption

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:52,330
right is to spread adoption of it you

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:56,619
know in a way that that that sort of

00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:58,450
infects more of sort of corporate

00:33:56,619 --> 00:34:00,279
corporate interest what we you know

00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,529
intertwine them with corporate interests

00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,909
but at the same time the key is of

00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:06,970
course maintaining our values while

00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:08,589
we're doing them so very so I want to

00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,960
add a little bit about the FOSDEM

00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:14,440
conference so it's been around almost 20

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,470
years yeah how do you sustain the

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,290
conference and see there

00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:22,859
any challenges that we could share with

00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:27,480
our partner here that we could they

00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:32,760
could support you in the future so how

00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:35,250
does sustain itself we have well two

00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,819
major sources of income

00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,500
one is of course sponsorship so if

00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:42,960
Facebook would want to sponsor you'd be

00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:46,950
very welcome to you just putting it out

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:52,250
there and the other one is the one that

00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:56,240
we really value the most because it is

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:58,710
by our community we ask for donations

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,960
voluntary donations and you get a

00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:07,079
t-shirt in return for your kind donation

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:09,930
of course but about half of the of the

00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:11,550
income of of Folsom is made by the

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,440
community the conference is completely

00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,540
free to attend it's completely open

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,490
there is no registration you just show

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,000
up walk into your room attend the tork

00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:23,970
be there engage with people holding a

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,369
stand we don't care who you are or where

00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:30,240
you come from just be there and enjoy

00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:32,940
yourself and getting donations from the

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,950
community is really important for us as

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:39,150
it really shows how much people value

00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:45,630
what we're doing and what we're

00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:49,140
providing and we try to well run a very

00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:51,000
tight ship so we try to spend well every

00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,700
euro that we spend we look at it twice

00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,329
before we actually do it we're entirely

00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:00,089
volunteer based and no one gets paid to

00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:05,310
organise falsi which obviously reduces

00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:09,780
costs so that is that is how we are we

00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:13,920
work the most challenging parts of it

00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:16,530
all is actually trying to convince

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,740
sponsors of the value of Folsom because

00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:23,160
one of the things that we do what we do

00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:25,230
tell our sponsors is that we're sorry

00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,240
we're grateful for your contribution but

00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:31,290
we cannot offer you any anything in

00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,690
terms of content there is no sponsor

00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:36,359
talks at folsom a sponsor can have a

00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,819
talk but that is completely unrelated to

00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:40,640
do them being a sponsor the program

00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:43,140
committee and the sponsorship you are

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,790
that there's an air gap between them and

00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,829
that's it's there for a reason

00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,270
sponsor people do not talk to the

00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,770
program you must do not influence

00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,619
anything

00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:55,440
same goes first and we offer sponsors

00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:58,710
the most visibility we can without

00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,690
intruding into the content so we'll go

00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,430
as far as you know showing your logo

00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,079
saying thank you in the opening talk and

00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:06,900
in the closing talk but that's pretty

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,630
much it and we see that the sponsors

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,910
that we get actually get that message

00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,960
and truly want to want to support the

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,000
community

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,000
they don't really care about being

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,859
present with five or six recruiters and

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,260
you know talking to people to find jobs

00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:24,670
no they want their engineers to attend

00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,690
and their engineers do you enjoy a

00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:32,020
conference with great content and

00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:35,800
participate in that way how about our

00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:40,960
situation here at floss Asia so we've

00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:44,829
been say permanent discussions with

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:48,339
variety of trailers what about black

00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:49,450
bears has been catering we don't have we

00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:51,130
have either no registration or free

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,760
registration we can't cater correctly

00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,760
don't know

00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:58,589
and I'd like actually how do you do that

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,779
so just go to the cafe yourself or

00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:03,119
what's the net so we don't provide

00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:05,190
catering on-site and so I mean I'm

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,440
amazed by maybe abundance of food

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,509
everywhere almost every room I walk I

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,359
walk into has some kind of drinks or

00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:13,920
food or whatever it's pretty cool to see

00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:16,739
but no we don't provide food to her

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,489
Anthony so we have a we invites food

00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:22,440
vendors street vendors and just buy

00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:28,200
stuff okay so that that might also be

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:29,819
terrible sort of expectations here also

00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,739
various times so we try to make it as

00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:33,869
convenient if possible to to the

00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:36,660
attendees which also depends on the

00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:38,640
financial situation of each year so when

00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,769
we get more support and we try to offer

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,930
the maximum convenience for the people

00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:45,089
and I want Roland to explain a little

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:48,239
bit between the draft between business

00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:50,609
and community so we run in for say sure

00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,400
we want to have the metric we want to

00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:54,479
welcome not only the committee developer

00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,970
of course so we feel calm but also

00:38:54,479 --> 00:39:02,210
enterprise so that's idea to bring

00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:05,359
people from different fields together so

00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:08,069
so that's a conscious choice that the

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:11,309
it's just the engagement the time I was

00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:16,170
there most extraordinary form of that so

00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:19,720
far and it perhaps is part of your

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:22,450
pursuing corporate adoption but it is

00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,890
we're dealing with responses not melius

00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:27,520
sources of cash all that thank people

00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:30,450
that's pretty damn important but also as

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,580
a very deep my for the comments that the

00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:36,760
the progression certainly next decade or

00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:39,610
two for open source kind of after pretty

00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,770
softly he's going to mean deeper

00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,570
engagement with with my to operations

00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,460
because that's where the money is that's

00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,780
where jobs are with engineers I go to

00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,140
end up being for most of their careers

00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:52,300
and so there's everything from the very

00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:56,230
light interaction we have of Facebook

00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:59,620
this year to the multiple sessions a

00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:02,260
consultation and a separate dinner that

00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,390
occurred was a pleasure but for two

00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,610
years actually ahead of them forming an

00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,380
internal open source division which for

00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:15,190
the old world manufacturing company is a

00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:17,710
bit of a change in culture so yes with

00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:22,270
interest agent as a conscious drive to

00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:24,040
engage for corporates as partners and

00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:27,040
almost targets if it's that's the right

00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,210
word but as because these partners not

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,810
anyone's having involuntarily

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:35,020
but it's to directly assist in their

00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:40,180
product in that process but I think the

00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:46,570
state that we need to or want to get to

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:49,000
is to to stop thinking about the

00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,240
corporation in the community and start

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,980
thinking about the community

00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,150
the corporation's don't join a community

00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,450
people in the corporation join a

00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:59,580
community right corporations don't

00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:02,280
sponsor events people write checks to

00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:06,000
sponsor events and so on and as long as

00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,880
we continue to to frame the thinking

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,109
around you know there's the people from

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,800
the corporate world and then there's the

00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:16,170
community it maintains that division

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,150
where we can think about like we are

00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,770
members of a community now there are

00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,140
good reasons that the community

00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,640
sometimes looks at you know corporate

00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,320
decisions or corporate participants with

00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,310
skepticism companies do not always act

00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,750
in the best interest of the community

00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:30,060
they often act in their own best

00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,619
interests and I think it's the

00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,150
responsibility of people who run open

00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:35,220
source program offices and who share

00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,900
knowledge with each other to make sure

00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,820
that their companies are showing up as

00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,099
good members of the community and most

00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,750
of the people that I know that are

00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:45,210
involved in those efforts have that very

00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:48,930
much on their mind it hasn't always been

00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:51,750
the case you know you talked about how

00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:54,300
sponsors for for positive they don't get

00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,710
special you know treatment as far as

00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,420
getting you know talks placed and

00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:00,020
everything else we've had that here this

00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:03,960
year one of the but one of the sponsors

00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:06,030
was pressing for what was very clearly a

00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,750
product pitch foreclosed was what I like

00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:12,480
that's no right that's I don't think

00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:16,650
that's good behavior on the back on the

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,630
behalf of a company right but not

00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:20,940
everyone in the company in any given

00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:24,480
company and it gets it and there's if

00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:26,490
you look at like so the closest thing

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,599
probably a typical corporate events team

00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:32,280
has to think about when looking at the

00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:34,230
community events and positive and Fossey

00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,690
Asia and single source events this trade

00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,040
shows and it's more normal at something

00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,810
like a trade show that you write a big

00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,830
check and you get some time right of

00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,330
course we always adapt talking to

00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,339
marketing because it looks like a trade

00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:48,420
show exactly and it takes a lot of

00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:50,700
Education to get people there so you

00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,900
know for people who run programs are

00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,820
involved in open source programs

00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,990
continuing to do advocacy for the

00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,890
community that is a key part of the role

00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,869
something that you're leaving out of

00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:03,880
your role then then it's something that

00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:06,369
we thank you so I think that we only

00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,650
have a few minutes left I would like to

00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:11,460
open the floor to the audience if you

00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:15,160
have any questions for our panelists

00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,940
about open source how to sustain open

00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,260
source projects conference especially

00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,800
questions for Michael who doesn't want

00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,800
to take the microphone

00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:33,610
No okay so then I would like to get back

00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,770
to the panelists for their final

00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:39,460
questions so what would be into one

00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:41,680
action every person here in the audience

00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,300
can take away when they leave

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,300
most Asian today

00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,990
alright I'll jump right in and give

00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,900
everybody else a time to time to think

00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:03,780
about it

00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:06,150
there is something that you can do today

00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,640
to make a difference for a conference

00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:12,150
for an open-source project for a

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,300
community event for community space that

00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:17,640
you've been you might not even have even

00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,990
recognized it but you may have

00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,210
recognized it and felt like it was

00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,490
outside your reach and maybe that's

00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:25,230
going back to your company and and just

00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,570
asking someone for the first time hey I

00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,700
think we should sponsor this or maybe

00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:32,160
it's finding that project that you use

00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:35,160
all the time that you've you've never

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,870
opened an issue on or never gone and

00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,000
tried to participate in the thing there

00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,700
is something everyone in the room is

00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,490
capable of doing that they may have been

00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,860
hesitant today there's the only thing

00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,300
that is stopping you from doing that is

00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,920
sort of your own hesitation I encourage

00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,450
you to find those if you can't find them

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,640
come find us and we'll help you find

00:44:51,450 --> 00:45:00,900
opportunities together I would like to

00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:03,060
you know tag onto that many of you have

00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:06,900
probably written some software I have

00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:08,970
been guilty of that too and thought that

00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,190
it was not really relevant for other

00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:13,680
people it may not be you know very

00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:17,250
special or it may be very specific to do

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:19,260
a task but just you know consider

00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:23,280
releasing it as open source I mean it

00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:25,230
may be sitting in your back on your back

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,030
of drive somewhere doing nothing but it

00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,890
may be of interest to someone so don't

00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,630
be shy and just you know publish it

00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:33,390
don't wait until you think it's perfect

00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:35,910
it is much much more important to you

00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:38,970
release it as soon as possible so other

00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:41,250
people can you know maybe help you find

00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:43,400
your way and improve your project as you

00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,400
go

00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:47,170
that sort of varying to thousands came

00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,579
out with a friend in Sydney who's a bit

00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,359
sort of bummed that he's realized that

00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,500
what he's trying to do was too

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,130
complicated and therefore he can't get

00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,760
it down

00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:57,910
sometimes the hesitancy arises just

00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,740
because you've said scope too big with

00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,960
starting anything at all okay fine you

00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,890
know if you come jump across Kenyan in

00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,059
one step

00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:08,710
what start with a smaller subset you eat

00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:10,420
one piece of the elephant is at a time

00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,220
so if it's if you're in that situation

00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:14,940
just pick something a little bit smaller

00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,809
and get it done whether it's a

00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,990
conversation with a colleague or a

00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:21,940
request for an employer or a bug fix or

00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:24,430
bug report or documentation collection

00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:27,839
or whatever it is because small thing

00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:27,839
and do it and then you repeat

00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:35,120
I don't have anything really unique to

00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:38,330
say beyond that that's uh but yeah I

00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,820
think I liked what was said about not

00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:43,670
differentiating between the community

00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:46,220
and the corporate the same way we spend

00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:48,650
so much of our lives at work right so I

00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,990
think the one the one thing on top of

00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,530
everything you know I think I think the

00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:56,540
action is to do something but I think I

00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:57,650
think beyond that I think it one thing

00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,430
that I would think would be really

00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:03,680
helpful is to take the energy and the

00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,930
community that we have here right and in

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,420
a sort of kind of a creepy way start

00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:10,310
spreading it at at work right we're

00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:13,970
we're you know look at the people at

00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:17,510
work as people yet to be converted right

00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:19,880
and and start there right because

00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:22,130
there's a lot of people there who who

00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,780
could be interested right and we spend

00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:26,570
so much time there and that that's what

00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:30,680
I think it starts with one of the

00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:33,140
actions that we talked about here ok so

00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,020
that is all the time that we have thank

00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:39,290
you very much for you but his basement

00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:41,770
Thank You audience for 2016 we enjoy the

00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,770
