	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,940
I'm gonna bring on stage Mario I think

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,470
without Mario we might not be holding

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,420
this event today because of all his

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,420
efforts and a strong supporter of all

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,730
these husk Asia projects Mario is the

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,289
CEO of open tech he's a technologist

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,270
with 15 years of experience in leading

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,300
International development's teams in

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,460
Europe Asia and India

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,199
Mario helped to get for ages started and

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,510
works with the community of Susi AI and

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,119
open-hearted solutions including Pocket

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,529
science lab that you saw earlier so

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,020
Mario also steals the development of the

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,190
event a project or a lot of things on

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,290
your plate

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,120
most of us have interacted Mario in some

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,710
form or other but few of us know that

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,360
he's also very fascinated by drums and

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,629
global music and an interest in

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,629
architecture so Mario please take over

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:58,620
okay thank you very much well yeah so

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:02,070
that was really nice to have this look

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,100
into the back and to the past of what

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,830
happened to before and and I want to

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,049
look a little bit forward as well so I

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,909
want to see what's the state of open

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,020
tech and specifically here was what we

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:18,750
do in the first asia community so what

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,950
we saw already in the talk of home folk

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,470
we are doing all of this open tech open

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,920
source free software we are working on

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,960
open hardware and we share what we have

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,170
openly we have a lot of data projects

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,439
are small and like Suzy AI or lock lock

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,560
and and of course we try to document it

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,170
and share all the knowledge that we

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,100
gained openly so we're doing all this

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:50,939
and I'm very proud of that so we make

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,689
enforce an open tech become true we have

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:58,380
had run hundreds of events and yeah we

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:01,170
already saw some screenshots here of the

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,600
force Asia Summit the globe Asia Summit

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,229
that we did as a first large event in

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,750
2009 but we are doing more so

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,380
I want to talk about what we will do

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:17,090
from here on more regional events with

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,620
connecting with more developers locally

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,770
then we have built a very active

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,739
developer community online and we are

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:30,239
one of the top-ranked projects among the

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:34,319
top hundred organizations on github and

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:37,130
currently number 14 and yeah we have

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,049
more than 3000 people and of course like

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,569
sometimes people are busy but like we we

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,880
see that people are coming back

00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,290
even like when they stopped their

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,299
contribution after some time because

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,090
everyone can just register for an online

00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:53,910
channel important is that you see the

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,519
contributions so on average and there's

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,799
a merge pull request around every 15

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,830
minutes on a Foss Asia project and you

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:04,799
can check that out on github we also

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:08,190
have a lot of chat channels and for

00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,170
example on a guitar and and yeah

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,140
assumptions of more than two thousand

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,290
members it is sometimes challenging so

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,430
we're trying to break this up so and it

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,160
will not be overwhelmed by the

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,769
communication but a lot is going on but

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,340
what we have to do numbers alone don't

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,200
count so in the next year's this year we

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,510
want to also focus more on quality

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,519
software development so we have a lot of

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,930
projects not all the projects are ready

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:40,230
for end consumers they run on my machine

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,620
on my hardware yeah and it's actually

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,600
not easy to make software work like

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,030
really for for everyone a lot of

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,500
different configurations have developers

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,829
know that a lot of different mobile

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,440
phones and even like sometimes the same

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:58,319
mobile form but with different versions

00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,670
things are challenging but we will work

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,359
on this and we will focus more on

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,430
quality then we have built open hardware

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,200
so now we have it we have the pocket

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,459
science lab there will be talks here at

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,579
the event there will be a lot of

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,560
showcases on Saturday we have the open

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,109
hardware day and with a morning

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,350
breakfast and so that would be nice here

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:19,989
we are sharing the knowledge how we

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,960
actually

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,940
produce it so we have gained this

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,490
knowledge now we have worked together in

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,699
Germany with a phone / Institute with we

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,400
are working with companies in China why

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:35,979
today we Ted he flew over him to

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,800
Shenzhen and we've learned a lot in this

00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:41,650
process so we can do more so what we

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,800
will do is we create and produce more

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,810
open hardware for example and we've

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,180
started the project the new OLAP

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,699
hardware project few years ago we had

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,490
our friend really here from the brand

00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:58,449
reno project and they inspired us to

00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:01,570
also work in the neural area and we will

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:03,669
work very hard to make a low-priced new

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,430
lab hardware that can help you to stain

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:07,270
brain waves with EEG and we will make

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,770
that happen

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,120
we're working on it we already have a

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,870
few prototypes here they should be

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,060
arriving I think tonight so that's what

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,509
we have done and we have worked on best

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,120
practices some people like some students

00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:24,639
maybe they're from they participated

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,699
with us and jisuk projects and I don't

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,729
know years ago do we have any student

00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:33,639
you who work with us on Angie sock yeah

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:36,310
okay yeah I see a few here and there so

00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,530
if you have worked with the first Asia

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,630
for example in Cote d'Or Google some of

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,880
code programs you will see that a lot

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,919
has changed over the year and we have

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,030
defined much more of our best practices

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:51,070
and it's much easier because in the old

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,409
times here to us how I'd do this I have

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,330
to do this and so on a lot of free

00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:57,550
software and open source community they

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,759
have their own best practices and it's

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,340
not always the same yeah and we have to

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,080
find them there's a very intensive blog

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:09,509
article that was written together by

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:12,400
with niranjan iranian rajendran and and

00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:14,409
he helped us a lot to define that so we

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,979
have best practices we share them with

00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:21,039
other communities and we want to do more

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:23,770
here as well and not just sharing the

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,930
best practices but actually fostering

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,330
more long-term partnerships by not by

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,039
sharing resources as well so not just

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,630
best practices we also need to share

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,940
resources so far Asia gets resources

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,250
not just coding programs now we also

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,840
earn income more and more for examples

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,140
through the pocket science lab sales

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,450
through other projects as well and we

00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,840
want to find more ways to also include

00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:51,320
more developers and we have incubated

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,840
the project's OS home folk mentioned we

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,130
had a lot of talks after last year

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,060
because we said we won't make a big

00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:01,610
incubator and so on so we meant a lot of

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,890
B C's when actually Sebastian Decker's

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,560
he helped us a lot also in this process

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,570
and the feedback was ok you have big

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,700
plans you want to do big things how

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,040
about you do in the next year one

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,400
project make this one project success

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,770
successful and go to the market and sell

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,040
it also the big difference to like let's

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,380
say a force Asia incubator we are not

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,230
building the multi-billion dollar

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:31,030
business that dominates the world our

00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:34,250
goal is to make sustainable faust

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,470
software and hardware happen so we want

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,470
to grow the ecosystem and we want to

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,270
have a sustainable income model so that

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,640
is different and we achieved this now

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,250
already with one project and the pocket

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,610
the pocket science lab and we will do

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:52,250
more make more projects ready for

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,370
end-users and make them ready to

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,690
incubate so for example of course the

00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,610
Suzy AI project

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,860
some people said oh here on the web app

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,240
not so much is going on where are you

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,780
what's going on where it's a huge

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,590
project to build an open source free

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,260
software personal assistant it's a it's

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,450
a big task and in the last six months we

00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,240
mainly focus on making the hardware work

00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:20,390
so the goal is that people can take the

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,250
hardware and walk around and even that a

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:26,000
lot of functionalities we want that they

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,100
work offline so big challenge or we've

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,140
achieved a lot and here at the event

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,270
Michael and the developers will share

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,380
and their progress in the last few

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,550
months so another point we have run

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,349
coding programs we have already

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,599
mentioned this with thousands of

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,700
developers actually and we found we

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,350
found models that scale it's very

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,420
difficult to scale you can always like

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,870
communicate face-to-face but how to use

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,850
scale as practice and so on is a way but

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,070
what we will do is we also have to go

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,990
out and meet people because just because

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,040
we reach a thousand people on a global

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:03,200
scale is still just very few people so

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,420
the question is how can we scale and we

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,670
can't scale it scale without having

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,200
face-to-face meetings so this is the

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,910
