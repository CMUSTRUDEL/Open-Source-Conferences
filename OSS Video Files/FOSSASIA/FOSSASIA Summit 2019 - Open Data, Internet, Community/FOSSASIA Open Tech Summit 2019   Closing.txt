us and going with us into late Sunday

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,170
afternoon it's been a very interesting

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,349
and very insightful afternoon with this

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,049
hackathon I think it's also been four

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,390
days of a lot of learning a lot of

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,670
sessions a lot of speakers bringing us

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,740
together so it's been great to everybody

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,039
attend and I mean I'm so glad to see

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,590
still a full room i briefed you want to

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,539
just thank our sponsors so IBM really is

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,239
coming on board is a diamond sponsor

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,620
this year and so really contributing and

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,320
helping us with getting this event off

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,329
the ground obviously also Google open

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,710
source who've been an advocate and a

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,690
strong supporter of the fast community

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,219
in Singapore together with all the

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,250
developer groups and all the meetups and

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:51,090
all the facilities and I think with all

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,340
these sponsors coming on board oh I

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,469
think we jumped up on here our gold

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,360
sponsors which is indeed Facebook and

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,940
Microsoft we've been able to achieve so

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:07,979
much so a real big thanks for our

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:09,510
sponsors and helping us get this far we

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,460
also want the sponsors to take this back

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,140
I think some of the sponsors and also

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,330
the feedback that we had from Vincent's

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,680
Daimler joining us last year they've

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,450
gone as far as creating their own fast

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,400
departments right so you know we see

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,720
these businesses taking what we have and

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,430
learning from how we share and

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,259
incorporating that into their businesses

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,640
and improving the quality of work that

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,549
they have and the quality that they

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,710
contribute back to the community we have

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,930
to absolutely thank our hackathon

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,640
sponsors so UNESCO thank you so much

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,740
again for being here this year it's been

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,740
so much fun so really appreciate

00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,270
okay and so our bronze sponsors who've

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,890
also come along and educated us Oracle

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,380
with my sequel and giving sessions

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,650
giving talks flow chain also presenting

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,790
on their machine learning so really very

00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,460
grateful for these sponsors to be here

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,530
and lastly all the other sponsors that

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,820
that have supported us and we really

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,399
encourage more of the community to come

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,860
to us it's not all about sponsors as you

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,090
see we mentioned the sponsors here but

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,280
we've tried to make sure that all the

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,810
content is as much open-source and as

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
much in the public domain as it can be

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,239
and that's most important to us and our

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,670
mission so the tagline this year as far

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,850
as the future I think as a kind of

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,840
closing thought I'd really like to take

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,700
encourage you to take this with you

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,100
because force is really maturing at a

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,510
great speed at a great pace and we're

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,820
seeing a lot of these technologies just

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,920
become embedded in so many parts of our

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,080
lives without us even knowing it I mean

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,640
we look at the mobile phones we use we

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,050
look at all the embedded devices we look

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,050
at all the computing platforms we use

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,540
they're all built on open source and so

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,940
I think with this very catchy tagline of

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,970
fauces the future for Sage has really

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,440
done something phenomenal this year as a

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,260
tenth year anniversary we've tried to

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,130
kind of liven it up with a few different

00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,720
events with a few different gatherings

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:03,720
and get to no use so it's really all of

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,670
you who've made all possible do you want

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,870
to have some closing words Roland yeah

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:14,730

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:16,410

thirst Facebook all the volunteers who

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,670
helped us run the event we are large

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,720
enough that it now requires a signal

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,380
people to run and we couldn't do it

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,790
