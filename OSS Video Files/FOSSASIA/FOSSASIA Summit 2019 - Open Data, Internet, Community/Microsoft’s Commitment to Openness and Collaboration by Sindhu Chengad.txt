Microsoft’s commitment to openness and collaboration is ingrained in our day-to-day approach to doing business alongside open source industry partners as well as communities around the world. Microsoft not only releases key innovations as open source for others to use and build upon, it also contributes code and thought leadership to open source communities.

going to speak to us at greater length

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,230
that we heard this morning about

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,210
Microsoft's commitment to open source

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,860
hello everybody good afternoon I'm super

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,390
excited to be here this afternoon with

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,239
you

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,770
now before I go into Microsoft and our

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,739
commitment to open openness and

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,870
collaboration I quickly want to show of

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,850
hands on how many of you have doubts

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:53,520
about this okay great so so I actually

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,440
think my work might not be that hard or

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,899
that heart cut out this afternoon I

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,820
didn't see that honey but great great to

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,340
see that so so let me share some more

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:09,869
about what we've been doing the last

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:13,920
couple of years okay I have a quick pop

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:16,350
quiz before we start okay and I do have

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,630
a couple of t-shirts to give away so so

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,950
let's see who's been catching up on on

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,750
Microsoft or what's been happening

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,759
latest in the my open source as well so

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,020
which popular Windows app did Microsoft

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,189
open-source last week okay that was too

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,310
many you should have put your hands up

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,670
now I don't know who answer okay can I

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,680
have one person say that out loud please

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:41,579
okay great so I'll get you a teacher

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,710
there can we pass that around please all

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,450
right one more and by the way the

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,670
calculator has been part of Windows

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,670
since version 11.04

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:57,750
so we just decided that we want to open

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,909
source the application the second what

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,170
percentage of virtual machines on Azure

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,150
are Linux

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:10,380
today okay I have

00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:14,819
so let me ask him 80 okay anyone else I

00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:18,660
had one year how much 80 percent okay

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:21,030
any other okay so I think we have the

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,730
closest one here that's 60 percent today

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,280
so eighty eighty is where we'd like to

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,870
get to but we are about sixty percent

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,230
today there we go

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,980
and the last one how many patterns did

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:38,760
Microsoft bring to two oin in October

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:43,350
twenty nineteen twenty eighteen okay

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,989
there we go so let's pass this on please

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,380
so uh as you can see Microsoft's been

00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:52,260
taking steps towards getting more open

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:55,940
and making sure that the Linux community

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,739
is is getting all the support it needs

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,019
we have been working very closely with

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,300
the open source community in general and

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,160
the 60,000 patterns that we we made

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,620
available to oh I an was to ensure that

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,120
the Linux community does not have any

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,450
more you know

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,269
patent infringes or cases that they have

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,860
to spend additional effort on so let's

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:25,790
move on these are a couple more

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:30,480
interesting facts so we discovered these

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:33,540
and so given the direction that our new

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,390
CEO Sofia has been taking he in the last

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,610
few years since he came in he has been

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,310
saying that we need to work a lot better

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,980
with the developer community that's been

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,530
very cool to Microsoft since its

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,019
inception and especially the open-source

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,340
community so so his belief is actually

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,980
there judges by the actions we've taken

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,920
in the recent past our actions today and

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,380
what we will take in future and if you

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,170
keep being keeping up as I just showed

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,840
you a couple of them lots lots of action

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,670
happening succeed for me in fact as the

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,890
open source lead it's been super

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,769
exciting because it's hard for me to

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:14,630
catch up what's happening internally now

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,630
this is let's go back sorry

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:26,130
okay so since 2014 is where we've seen a

00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,730
lot more momentum happening with which

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:33,810
started with Satya embracing very openly

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:37,950
that that we do love Linux and the open

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:41,520
source ecosystem is important for us he

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:44,430
did out the dotnet foundation was

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,630
created then dotnet chorus you probably

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,130
know and the 2015 vs code was released I

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:54,330
think that that's that was one

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:57,630
significant milestone that happened in

00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:02,400
2015 today as of last year that's in

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,960
2018 vs code was announced as I think it

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,420
was by the stack overflow developer a

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,790
survey that happened last year and it

00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,420
was anonymously silly out selected as

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:15,210
the most popular editor so so I think

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:19,290
it's done you know it's gone leaps and

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,760
bounds since then HD inside so yeah I

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,380
don't want to go through every single

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,730
one of them but the more important ones

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,660
were when we joined the Linux Foundation

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:29,550
in 2016 we when we announced sequel on

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,920
Linux I think that was never expected

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,750
for years we said that sequel is gonna

00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,150
run only for the windows ecosystem and

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:40,560
nobody else and when we eventually

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:42,600
launch sequel on on Linux I think a lot

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,640
of things changed we've actually seen

00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,030
the biggest uptake for sequel and the

00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,040
growth for sequel since we went

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,440
supportive of Linux so I think that

00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,020
that's definitely the way we see and in

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,500
20 equal 2019 they'll actually be a lot

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,940
more features that would be Linux and

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,980
open source friendly that are going to

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:09,000
be shared very soon so 2017 the the

00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,400
azure kubernetes service was launched so

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,480
this is making so the co-founder of

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:18,750
coconut is Brendan burns join Microsoft

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,270
is one of the the engineers and he's

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,210
helped improve the kubernetes experience

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,090
on Azure which means for from a

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,390
developer's perspective it's just going

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,860
to be

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:34,170
lot more easier for the use kubernetes

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:36,720
on Azure and what else yeah we joined

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:40,140
the cloud native computing the Cloud

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,600
Foundry foundations the database for

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:46,470
Postgres my sequel so these are managed

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,990
services for Postgres and my sequel

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,940
community versions so which means you

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:54,300
you get the benefit of what you've been

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:57,150
using already but with cloud so you get

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,400
high availability as well as the scale

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,220
and the you know the ability to scale

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,470
out whenever you need so it just means

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,790
you have that added advantage to the

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:11,370
cloud and we are data breaks as your

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,950
data breaks was announced last year and

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,110
then the biggest one I think which was

00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,360
last year the biggest shocker was was

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,260
the github acquisition we did finish

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,970
that last year and I think initially I

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,680
was at another event and the first

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,450
question I got asked was oh my god

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,660
github got acquired what are you going

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,010
to do with it I even read about a lot of

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,560
people saying I'm going to switch to

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:38,340
grid lab tomorrow and you know all of

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,140
that happening but I think eventually we

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,100
we just let people wait it out and see

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,750
how it goes I think today the the change

00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,340
has just been that yeah we're still

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,760
going to stay the same github doesn't

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:53,910
change in fact you do have private repos

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,960
available for users right now so that's

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,770
that's probably one of the bigger

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,220
changes that's that's happened I think

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,870
the last one which I don't have up there

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,810
2019 that happened in January this year

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,390
was the slightest acquisition so we

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,970
acquired the company called situs so

00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,850
that our post careers managed service

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,440
performance could be a lot better

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,960
Microsoft does believe it that one of

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,610
the core Paul like what'd he say

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,220
believes is that we need to make sure

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,300
that the experience is good and if one

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,460
of the feedbacks we got was the

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,930
performance hasn't been there great you

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,160
know the next steps by engineering was

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,380
that okay let's see how we can improve

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,150
that so this acquisition was one step in

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,390
that direction to see how we could

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:39,529
improve our performance of course Christ

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:42,050
SoundCloud let me move on so

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:43,789
it's a good segue to my next life which

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,579
talks about how we think about open

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:49,459
source internally and I just want to

00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:51,560
share that with you so when we look at

00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:54,259
open source for us it's about in a way

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,540
to contribute and enable what we mean by

00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:59,600
that is I will go into some details

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,610
about this but it just means that we not

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,850
only want to be part of the community to

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:08,029
give but we also want to be contributing

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:11,449
we we did I think before the hub

00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:13,009
acquisition the largest contributor in

00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:17,209
terms of code number of lines of code

00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:18,439
was was Microsoft so I think it's just

00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:21,259
been a logical move in that direction

00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:25,040
that we want to keep contributing but

00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:27,610
also make sure that we we have people

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,930
using our open source software as well

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:35,360
and that that's a continuous cycle so

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:39,559
let me go into the next slide I'll go

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,999
into why in a wait so so I think the one

00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:45,529
biggest thing I want to call out here is

00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:47,720
vs code when it was outsourced in 2015

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,970
I think the there was people people

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,100
still associated with visual studio said

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:56,300
ok I'm not touching it by a crowbar

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:58,430
right but I think we didn't have to

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,189
right now just going by last year's

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,500
Stack Overflow developer results it's

00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:04,699
it's quite obvious that people have been

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,589
picking it up from the open source

00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:09,019
community and popularity has been

00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:11,269
growing just because it is super easy to

00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:13,970
use and so they're here my colleague

00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:16,129
will be giving us a little demo in a few

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:21,199
minutes and you can you can see how V s

00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:23,269
code works with peyten specifically so I

00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:24,709
think among the other things we've also

00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,699
contributed to other open source

00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:30,170
languages like our typescript PowerShell

00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:33,589
originally from Microsoft but these are

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,329
open source today and if you look at

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,519
some of the other things like it's

00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,259
leading the NOx innovator

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,209
we have been contributing a lot to the

00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:44,449
Linux kernel as well since we joined the

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:46,429
Linux Foundation so on so so that's on

00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:48,360
the innovation piece so again

00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:50,489
contributing we

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,779
we did contribute a lot of lines of code

00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:55,769
to github it's who we see that as a

00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:58,110
something that that needs to keep going

00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:59,879
on which means we not only take the best

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,309
from the open source world we see that

00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,739
as important for our own software but

00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:09,629
but contry continuously contributing and

00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:11,759
giving back and and and hence being

00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:14,809
Platinum members of foundations like the

00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:17,549
the Lavazza foundation or the CFCF and

00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:19,470
lots lots of communities again which

00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:21,029
have been built up so that's from a

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,369
contribute perspective

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:28,110
let's more last one which is enable and

00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:30,269
so when I when I spoke a few minutes ago

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,730
about services like my sequel or

00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:35,009
Postgres the whole idea is to give

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,779
developers the freedom to choose what

00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,670
they want so you know it doesn't matter

00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,290
what operating system you're using or

00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,139
what device you're using it can be a Mac

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:45,360
or it could be you know a Windows Device

00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,860
but give you the choice give you the

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,540
freedom to decide what you want to use

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,040
and use it the way you'd like it so so

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,689
we've been trying to make sure that we

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,999
not only have our first party services

00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:59,040
but also enabling a lot of the third

00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:01,110
party and the open-source services today

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,100
that are available on Asscher so that

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,049
the experience is seamless so my sequel

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,369
or Postgres is one of them it's one such

00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:11,639
example data bricks and all the

00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:13,169
kubernetes and then we did recently also

00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,829
announced that openshift Red Hat's

00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:17,819
openshift

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:20,819
will be a has offering on Azure so you

00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:22,529
will see that coming very soon it was

00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:25,679
announced last year and you'll see

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:28,169
openshift on Azure as a as a managed

00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:32,069
service as well

00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:38,339
and anything else I think I've covered

00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:41,189
that this is just a quick snapshot of

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,709
all of the the technologies that are

00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:46,259
supported this is not the end of it but

00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,149
this is just a quick summary of the most

00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:51,540
popular technologies that are supported

00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:54,410
or nasha but it's a lot it's logged

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,410
beyond what this is

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:03,520
and I want to reiterate that when when

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,800
we say we talk about Asha we talk about

00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,380
Asha as a cloud for all for everybody

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,600
and to bring whatever you are currently

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,340
using whatever like I said technologies

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,540
or platforms you already invested in and

00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:18,190
bring that to to Azure to get the the

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,260
scalability of a hyper scale ability or

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,720
you know the high availability of

00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,160
everything that that every benefit that

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,960
you can get by using the cloud and

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,420
running your applications in the cloud

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,080
so that's what we want you to benefit

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:34,510
from so from a productively standpoint

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,550
it just means that we we want to make

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,190
all of the the tools the best tools

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,110
available the best services available as

00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,770
well as the management make sure that

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,940
from a Productivity standpoint

00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,770
developers are able to get their

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,540
applications out there to the market and

00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,400
to their users as soon as possible

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:56,860
without wasting time and you know

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:58,660
unnecessary operational from from hybrid

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,940
perspective I think it's again it

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,770
extends to the same thing that means you

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,270
get the best of both worlds so if your

00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,310
applications have been on Prem and

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:09,100
you're trying to move to the cloud you

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,450
get the seamless experience of let's say

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,010
you don't want to move everything you

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,500
want to just move some things because

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,630
it's not an easy move you have data you

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,040
have security you have management you

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,920
have a lot of issues to deal with when

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,660
you move from on from ice to cloud and

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,760
the idea is that you may not be able to

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,350
deal with everything together but you

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,930
choose what you want to keep on Prem

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:33,780
what you want to move to cloud and you

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:36,850
get the best of that seamless experience

00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:40,000
intelligent because there are a lot of

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,220
today like the services that that Asha

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,710
provides you from a data perspective or

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,440
from let's say machine learning

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:50,020
cognitive abilities you will have AI

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,580
embedded into everything so AI or

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,560
machine learning and better data every

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:57,700
service that that's being offered so

00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,580
which makes it it a lot intelligent for

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,860
users to be able to to get to like

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,230
improve their their applications now you

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,800
you get a lot more than what your you're

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,200
bargaining for

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,570
and then trusted because I think from

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,210
our perspective without customers asking

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,640
us it's super important for us to make

00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,700
sure that a privacy or security is very

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,910
very top-notch so we have a lot of ISO

00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:25,370
certifications regional or no even

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,210
country specific certifications just to

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,650
make sure that a privacy or security

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:34,400
standpoint that that's not compromised

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:37,280
or on the cloud so that that's insured

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,630
on the cloud can we just move to the

00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,750
next slide so the you want to wrap this

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:45,170
up and give some times on the demo I've

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:48,470
talked about this already so from from a

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,720
github or an Asha perspective both of

00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,550
these are just ways for for you to have

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,070
the better experience and that freedom

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,410
so it means whether you want to develop

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,330
or you want to operate and finally

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,640
deliver your application it just means

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,620
used both you can bring your own tools

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,440
we could go to the next one next slide

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,570
yeah so bring your own tools as well so

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,000
either use the services that Asha

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,040
provides you or you bring your own tools

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,020
wherever you've been using and you'll

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,030
still have that seamless experience that

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,940
that's the way it's intended to be right

00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,350
so now let's move on to the demo and

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,260
these are some quick numbers but I want

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:27,399
to go to the demo right away

00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,399
[Music]

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,960
so how we can have a one tool which we

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:58,090
can actually leverage to write you know

00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:06,730
our our lovable code which we do so let

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:09,040
me just put and so why we do serial code

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,620
the first one is you can actually have

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,920
within your code installed on a Windows

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,810
box you can have it or if you have this

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,940
box you can actually go down install so

00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:21,460
check cross-platform tool which is

00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,200
available which is make easier for you

00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,180
if you move from one path you know what

00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,970
offering system to another you can still

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,500
use this rule the second good thing

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:33,430
about the middle school encoding is

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,980
light weight it starts really quick and

00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:40,840
for example if I just say go ahead and

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:44,260
use Visual Studio code and I'm gonna run

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,760
it as administrator and then asking

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,980
permission I'm just fine and boom right

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,590
because what happens is you know it it

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:56,290
doesn't have the capability that it has

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,690
it's all the expenses that it provide

00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,370
and that's the another capabilities of

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,830
videos to your code so what you can do

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,290
is you can actually go ahead and add

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:07,840
various extension that you are working

00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:10,810
on for example on my screen on the left

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,670
hand side you can see I have extension

00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:15,280
for the communities what happens is

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:20,710
after that I install the extension on my

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,450
visual studio code I can actually go

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,040
ahead and manage my cluster from here or

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,870
get people to run my cube serial

00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,170
commands I can actually go do it from

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:31,810
here itself right one of the services

00:18:29,170 --> 00:19:14,650
that we have in the age of the universe

00:18:31,810 --> 00:19:19,240
so machine learning again install it and

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:23,590
you're good to go right cool now what

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,370
I'm going to do is after dotnet I love

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,370
Python

00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:58,389
so basically I'm using and what I'm

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:58,389
doing from here right

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,239
[Music]

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,840
[Music]

00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,210
[Music]

00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:04,629
so breakdown if I just gonna say one

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:07,460
thing is before P and n which

00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:10,940
interpreter you want to select so you

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:14,199
can see in my environment

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,199
[Music]

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,290
[Music]

00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,050
two environments over here and what I'm

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:47,330
going to do is when I'm going to select

00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:49,070
control okay so control shift P and I'll

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,470
select my interpreter and I'm gonna say

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,820
I'm gonna select my base Condor once

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,820
you're done with that I can write you

00:21:52,820 --> 00:22:04,190
can say word and run this file in the

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:06,110
okay as soon as I did I'm going to do

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,360
that but more interesting is as a

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:15,050
developer wanna write this code I want

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:17,030
to debug it my cartridges are happening

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,980
and if I were to you know I figured out

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,980
something that the runtime I should be

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,650
able to do that right so what I'm gonna

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:32,030
do is wave work and say let's go and

00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:34,220
debug and I can see I stopped at the

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,780
line number two and on the left hand

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,920
side it basically shows me all the

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,680
variables right over here okay and I can

00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:46,220
just say step over step into all this

00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,470
stuff I can do so and let's say if I

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,880
want to add I want to watch something

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:55,160
some variable for example

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:57,920
what's there in the conflict and I will

00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,210
get the information right so either

00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,430
developer I can actually go down

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,560
troubleshoot and figure out what's

00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:12,140
happening and let's go ahead and run

00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:13,610
this and if I go back right so as you

00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,260
can see in the bottom on the terminal

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,270
itself I get the response back that

00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,520
means my all the documents and get

00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:23,330
inserted so if I go back into my cosmos

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,160
TV account and refresh the page and you

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,780
have to trust me that earlier there was

00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,260
no database in the collection so

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:36,230
okay so I should have all the documents

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:39,890
over here right so I have both the

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:47,720
documents right now apart from that if I

00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:50,360
would use the same editor and I can run

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,180
my node.js code and once I've done with

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,820
that I can actually go ahead and run it

00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,380
so I'm going to say note that's the

00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,300
intelligence autocorrect lenient

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,770
intelligence feature of videos to the

00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,660
poor so as soon as I'm going to write

00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,340
something it's going to show me you know

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,710
you want to do something and I'm say

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:09,530
love and I'll get all this information

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:13,190
so I'll just go to end is that and let's

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:16,970
go to grant this guy and say Lord apt or

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:23,840
guess book hello from vs poor to be

00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:32,510
fourth place yet 2019 okay so the last

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:34,970
thing is I do have so if you have I can

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,800
say again I'll select in the Python

00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,310
interpreter and I can say right click

00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,050
run this in a Python interactive window

00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,430
because I was Jupiter is already started

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,170
as you can see on the right inside I'll

00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:51,310
get the output then in there itself

00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:51,310
right so entire experience whatever

00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:00,290
alright I think we are on time

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:06,140
cool maybe you can take a one or two

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:13,240
questions if time permits it's like one

00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:13,240
question while we hook up an XP cursor

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,830
source that there's really one statement

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:25,590
that would that it could make for that

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:28,110
and that's to open source windows so the

00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,460
question is so here's the thing it's

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,860
like clearly they'll to the elephant in

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,390
the room right so what is Microsoft's

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,740
thinking around this I mean they

00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,740
couldn't you guys could have commercial

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,120
distributions I mean it seems to me that

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,590
you know you wouldn't instantly lose

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,910
your customer base overnight so I'm just

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:49,470
curious what that conversation looks

00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:51,480
like internally Microsoft has done the

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,179
unthinkable in a couple of years

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,429
honestly it's when I join four years ago

00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,500
I used to be part of the the compete

00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:01,230
team so I was like wait Oakland Soros is

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,419
part of compete so and then you know

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,250
it's changed today completely so what I

00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,720
see internally as well as what's been

00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,730
happening like like with sequel and

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,950
other things so I wouldn't be surprised

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,480
if it does I can't comment on that today

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:17,360
because I'm not the person who decides

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:21,559
but I I would just say wait and watch

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:24,840
and I do hope that we've managed to

00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,910
change some of your perceptions the ones

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,850
who raise your hands today but feel free

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:32,880
to reach out to any of us if you have

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,360
any other questions we'd love to get you

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,390
know we'd love to support you thank you

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:45,159
Microsoft looks bigger

00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:45,159
