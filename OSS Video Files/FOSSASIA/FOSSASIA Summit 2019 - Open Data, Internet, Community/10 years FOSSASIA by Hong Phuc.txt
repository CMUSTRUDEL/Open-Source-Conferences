00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,190
far we've come and how we should be

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,160

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,700
Foss Asia in 20 2009 as a community

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,230
devoted to improving people's lives

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,510
through sharing open technologies

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,820
knowledge and fostering a global

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,829
connections unfuck especially once

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,629
encourage developers from Asia to

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,809
participate in the free and open source

00:00:48,629 --> 00:01:03,870
software movement so Hong fook welcomed

00:00:51,809 --> 00:01:06,210
a round of applause thank you thousand

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,670
for the introduction I think you

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,560
mentioned everything about Foss Asia I

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,590
don't know if the evening is enough for

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:19,170
me to say so my friends and there are

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,970
people in the community call me HP bank

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:26,310
or HP you can also call me them why do

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,080
we study for Asia so the reason it

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,650
wasn't mentioned in the beginning so we

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,380
want to foster global connection share

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,759
open technology and knowledge I am

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,619
originally from Vietnam and we feel the

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,570
need of connecting with people around

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,329
the world to bring open source and free

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,630
software to into the region when we

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:53,729
started 10 years ago the first movement

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:56,490
is not as developed lace is now and I

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,920
will original idea just to have an event

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,310
to bring people together to connect and

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,770
work on projects this is a picture that

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:10,379
taken in at our first event in Ho Chi

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:13,260
Minh City 2009 we have 1004 for 1400

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:21,390
participant at a time in more than 60%

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:23,760
of the ten days were female this is what

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,290
we are today so we have over 3000

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,810
developer active on the foss asia

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:34,980
network more than 30,000 subscribers to

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:37,500
our organization and we are not only an

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,660
event organiser anymore we develop a lot

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,129
of free software project ourselves you

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,420

00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:49,260
throughout event there will be a lot of

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:54,780
fosters vicar will go into detail of the

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:58,379
projects and from the event in 2009 now

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,840
we not only have one in your event we

00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,239
have several events everywhere in the

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:08,069
region and several meetups happening in

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:15,269
Malaysia in China India Jakarta Vietnam

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:18,330
and many other places I will fly to take

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,909
a few minutes to look back what have we

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:26,280
been through during the last 5-10 years

00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:28,470
and I only do the highlighted activities

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,299
because we don't have a lot of time to

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,230
go through every single thing or every

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:36,180
single day of 10 years so in 2010

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,790
together with the force Asia Summit in

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,379
Ho Chi Minh City we also host the first

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:47,069
time MIDI Def Con and I believe that

00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:50,670
some of the speaker from 2010 here in

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:52,470
the audience and truly are you here

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,890
please cut your hand yes so he was there

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:58,370
with us in 2010

00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:01,320
[Applause]

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:05,610
in the same year we also hosted the

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,590
first free liebherr graphic software in

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,640
her human city to introduce the people

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,530
designer in others quite other free

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,080
software tools available for them to

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,390
work with as you know that in Vietnam

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,820
was how is Asia country will use a lot

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,170
of pirated software like Photoshop but

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,450
now we want to offer them the

00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,620
alternative that they not only can work

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,370
with with stuff where they can also

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,610
contribute to face up well so we have a

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,520
group of designers coming from Europe to

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:40,130
come in to talk about in scape game

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:46,010
blender and many other solution in 2011

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:48,600
we started our own distribution and

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,370
until today it is a project called

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,400
Malick's that you can find on the Foss

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,370
Asia channel in the same year we also

00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:01,250
organized one of the biggest tech become

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:04,170
integrated Nickelback and Mako 2012

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,450
scene we have a visitor coming from all

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,460
over the world we decided ok so we start

00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,500
an open source hotel where we host a lot

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,590
of developers from everywhere we want to

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,930
spend a few weeks or days in Vietnam to

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:20,580
work on their project we hosted people

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:26,430
from dbn from the game project but I can

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:30,050
go on in 2013 so we'd have to work with

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:33,570
a university and education sector so we

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:37,110
we have volunteers and of all Asia team

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,090
members to go to school University and

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,680
give presentation and talk about free

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,740
stuff we're sure this it and how to work

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:48,540
with Python and how to introduce them to

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:54,480
open source education program like who

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:56,130
goes amok code in 2014 this is the

00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,530
picture taken in for Asia and Phnom Penh

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:02,040
what happened in this time so the first

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:04,830
time we met a teacher from India and we

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,570
made a promise to him that we will help

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,090
him to solve an issue

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,210
hardware is really expensive and not

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,520
affordable for students in India so we

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,710
decided that moving from SAP where we

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,660
want to invest our effort to do more

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,760
research on how to and see how we can

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,729
make open-source how we're possible in a

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,800
font evolved for everyone and it's later

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:32,290
on become the Pakistan lab that you seem

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,419
today in 2015 we moved here annual force

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,070
HS submitted to Singapore and Mac

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,979
Singapore the home of what for Asia

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,090
cement and this would probably the best

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:45,160
decision that we ever met because

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,380
Singapore we have a wonderful support of
