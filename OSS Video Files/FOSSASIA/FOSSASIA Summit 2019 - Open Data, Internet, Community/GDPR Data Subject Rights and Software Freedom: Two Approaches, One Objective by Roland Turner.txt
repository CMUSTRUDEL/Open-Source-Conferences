Software Freedom: The Free Software Foundation's four essential freedoms seek to put human beings (users) in very real control of the software running on their devices.
Data Subject Rights: The European General Data Protection Regulation's data subject rights seek to put human beings (data subjects) in very real control of the processing of data about them.These two apparently-unrelated approaches pursue the same objective: protecting and expanding human freedom by limiting the ability of powerful organisations to use automation to exert power over individuals. This session will compare and contrast these two approaches, offer a way to think about what GDPR is actually trying to achieve, and provide an overview of the questions technologists should be asking about systems that process personal information.
