Software Freedom: The Free Software Foundation's four essential freedoms seek to put human beings (users) in very real control of the software running on their devices.
Data Subject Rights: The European General Data Protection Regulation's data subject rights seek to put human beings (data subjects) in very real control of the processing of data about them.These two apparently-unrelated approaches pursue the same objective: protecting and expanding human freedom by limiting the ability of powerful organisations to use automation to exert power over individuals. This session will compare and contrast these two approaches, offer a way to think about what GDPR is actually trying to achieve, and provide an overview of the questions technologists should be asking about systems that process personal information.

[Applause]

00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:08,820
thanks very much my sort of day job as a

00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,849
chief privacy officer for a company that

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,620
performs relationship analytics this

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,080
gets right into the middle of privacy

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,330
law all over the world so I spend a lot

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,650
of time dealing with this and in

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,590
particular dealing with gdpr

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,189
and given that it keeps coming up and it

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,380
keeps being a bugbear for developers

00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:30,539
operations people security people I had

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,309
intended to do a talk on what

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,200
technologists need to know about gdb are

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,040
for for SATA this year and in fact

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,920
that's how this talk

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,469
ends but I realized while I was putting

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,010
it together that there's actually a much

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:47,870
larger idea here that I thought was

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,910
worth sharing what I realized was that

00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,890
software freedom and the GDP are status

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,289
update rights are in fact pursuing the

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,850
same objective I hope I persuade you

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,379
that is it's almost exactly the same

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,309
objective it's not too similar and then

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,659
I'll talk about what you need to know

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:10,799
about gdb are in practical use so what

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,080
is the objective the FSF's essential

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,020
freedoms and the GDP ours data sublet

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,619
rights seek to put individual human

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,369
beings in very real control with respect

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,390
to computers that we own and use control

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,770
the software that's running on those

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,780
machines with respect to data that other

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,860
people or organizations are processing

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,470
about us that is any data and any

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,180
organizations or people control their

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,590
data and then a particular kind of

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,509
control the actual words used also turn

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,040
out to be rather similar the free

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,450
software foundation unabashedly talks

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,579
about freedom and software freedom I

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,040
sort of apologize for a free software

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,450
because what they mean is freedom not

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,650
free of charge

00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,880
gdpr talks about fundamental rights and

00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,130
freedoms that phrase appears more than

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,800
50 times in the regulation GDP honor is

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,900
unequivocally human rights law we look

00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,030
at it as yet another technical standard

00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,250
to comply with but it is not it's very

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,450
clearly human rights law once you get

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,890
your head around that that changes the

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:21,740
way it looks and changes where you think

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:24,530
about it frequently I get people sort of

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,630
saying to me things like you know this

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,650
gtp has real pains was stuff that it

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,730
gets in the way in butter do these

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,370
things and oh my god it's it's so

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,410
inconvenient and I who sort of works is

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,130
at all time and he uses it as a

00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:40,310
blueprint have exactly the reverse

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,570
response to it and it finally began to

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,940
occur to me that this is an argument

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:48,050
that I have seen before historically

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:52,190
centuries ago it's the complaint that a

00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:54,500
change in social norms and in laws and

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,090
in therefore some of those laws gets in

00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:02,739
the way of an existing set of practices

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,739
and so the example that give is this one

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,850
before you think I've gone completely

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,900
off the deep end the point I'm making in

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:14,500
the first instance it's just that

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,560
society progresses legal systems change

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,550
businesses that are locked into or

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,730
dependent upon an old way of doing

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:26,690
things will struggle when these

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:28,100
transitions occur just as cotton pickers

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,990
in the southern part of the u.s. in

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,910
particular we're really upset about the

00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,250
idea that they would no longer be able

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,020
to own cotton pickers have to go and do

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,580
it themselves so so like the cotton

00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:43,280
farmers were upset that they're gonna be

00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:43,970
able to own cotton pickers however after

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,610
thought about this for a while I

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:51,170
realized that the power runs much much

00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,610
deeper than is really about I won't take

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,280
you through this entire document but

00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,660
it's fascinating it's fairly

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,860
straightforward language is only about

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,060
30 pages long the EDPs is a role the

00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,760
European data protection supervisor is

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,440
an individual role created within the EU

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,940
system I won't try to explain where it

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,540
sits because even with gigantic

00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,410
complicated diagrams of EU institutions

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,290
the important facts now that this

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,940
gentleman has remarkable rights with

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,420
respect to both the legislative and

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,530
regulatory processes within the EU and

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,850
it is therefore somewhat influential

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:27,260
it's a five year contract basically the

00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:32,090
current gentleman whose name I neglected

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:34,730
to note is very well versed does not

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,730
mince words but absolutely understands

00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:42,470
the topic from this particular opinion

00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:44,840
I've extracted two sentences I wish to

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,150
emphasize this is a little part of the

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,080
problem but he's explaining in that

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:55,310
opinion he deals with the whole range of

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,470
methods of manipulation the whole dark

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,560
patterns sing addictive patterns all

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,710
those things but also targeted

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,330
advertising this is a method of

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,640
manipulation target advertising isn't

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,599
just like broadcast advertising or

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:15,039
newspaper advertising but a bit better

00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:16,809
it's better because it is more able to

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,580
change the decisions that people make

00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:23,349
and means that are used to produce it

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,110
and to fine-tune it and define SHINee's

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:30,429
delivery categorically have nothing to

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:34,509
do with the improved accuracy or

00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:35,529
precision or personal welfare resulting

00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,219
from those decision making processes

00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:41,379
they relate exclusively to the increased

00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:44,639
revenue for the platforms that are using

00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,639
and performing the targeting

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,000
strong words but he goes further in fact

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,960
he goes much further I reiterate this is

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,640
one little part of the problem the

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,770
principle mighty bezzie identifies the

00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,060
human rights that are at stake the

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,310
principle of local transparency is not

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,660
met if voters cannot seek receive and

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,410
share information about the process and

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,260
the candidates in their funding these

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:13,560
rights are also therefore challenged by

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:16,590
online manipulation a direct consequence

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,440
of these two observations is that

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,640
targeted advertising is it compatible

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,280
with democracy

00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,020
it's that stock this is not hypothetical

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,270
we've now seen it with the recent u.s.

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,990
presidential elections and the brings it

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,730
vote we have very good reason to believe

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,010
that the Russian troll Factory was

00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,890
involved in these 2016 presidential

00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:40,730
action at the US and increasing evidence

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:43,350
that the same is true for brakes it

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,750
targeted advertising is a high power

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,820
super precise manipulation machine it is

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,480
totally incompatible concept of

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:55,910
individual citizens governing as a

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:59,580
society or state and for the third time

00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:02,040
this is only one of the problems here

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:07,190
that defies a dozen other problems at

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,190
this scale so

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,200
while the abolition of slavery seems

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:18,690
like an almost crazy under comparison it

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:21,240
starts to seem a bit less crazy the

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,000
other point I'd make is it's not remote

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,200
from us Mabel is weird thinking's of

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,330
lawyers and human rights activists are

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,480
getting up into is perhaps out of scope

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:33,780
for force Asia this talk happened on

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,220
Friday this is a project that's looking

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,570
to reduce a personal assistant that

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,490
works for its user takes away the biases

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,800
that are there to serve the platform

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,370
owner and the highest bidding of their

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,730
customers they're looking to adopt Suzy

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:54,090
as a core component of a neutral

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,700
unbiased fair personal system this is

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,530
false Asia two days ago so it's it's

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,160
right in the middle of all ages about

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,160
excuse me

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:07,250
briefly all this was a stalking horse

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:12,560
for reminding people that were about the

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:15,289
f as well as the old we spent a lot of

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,370
time talking about open source and I

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,889
don't drink that at all

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,240
it's it's it's a legitimate mechanism

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,360
it's the basis for most of our

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,490
cooperation the distinction from free

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,070
software or with free software is

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,770
perhaps not immediately obvious so much

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,289
so that when we had our first keynote

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,729
last year from a member of the or

00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,400
representative of the open source

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,510
initiative he essentially claimed that

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,180
free software and open-source software

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,990
were the same thing that there was no

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:47,980
difference between them at all from the

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:53,270
standpoint of the approach that is

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:55,180
somewhat true in the sense that all free

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,370
software is also open source software

00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:03,589
and the free software foundation in fact

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:08,000
supports this view this is the same

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:12,920
approach being pursued in the service of

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,720
two different objectives one is users

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:21,380
freedom the other is quality efficiency

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,480
flexibility of software footnote in to

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,150
predatory vendor lock-in which is a kind

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,080
of freedom what is in fact a freedom

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,970
either objective but apart from that

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,920
overlap they are two quite different

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,779
objectives it happens that the approach

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:42,980
to them is very much the same but

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:44,060
today's discussion is more about the two

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,970
different approaches to the DES to a

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,290
specific objective pepping the the free

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,600
software rather than the open-source

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,980
objective so I don't wish to suggest

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,170
that one is greater or less than the

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,279
other they are both important and the

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,350
fact that the approaches overlap so

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,209
enormously means that we're able to deal

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,540
with or able to address both in this

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,540
forum

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,310
hopefully most people have already seen

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,140
this but in case you haven't the four

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,350
essential freedoms that the FSF

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,660
identifies for free software to run a

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,360
piece of software forget what they use

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,380
for at will anyway you like and for any

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,980
purpose to study it and modify it any

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,330
way you like for the reason you want to

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,170
share copies of the program in order to

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,340
help people around you and to share

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,960
copies of the or modified version of the

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,720
software further to help people around

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,790
you this is different to although

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,870
related to the the open source

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,250
definition and therefore the Debian free

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,420
software guidelines with it but for

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,880
today's talk I'm talking specifically

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:49,350
about the freedoms that free software is

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,970
saying that like I'll switch our hands

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,690
as this familiar to everyone at least

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,190
some people don't have alright fair

00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,390
enough

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,630
ok so now let's go and have a look at

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:03,870
Judy PR and specifically the data

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,280
subject rights gdpr is 88 pages which

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,540
sounds like a lot until you compare it

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,560
with things like keep R and a bunch of

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:14,310
other even more prescriptive rules a

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,780
chunk of it is a set of legally

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,120
enforceable Human Rights that are

00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,740
created these are called rights they

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,300
apply to every single natural person

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,590
within the jurisdiction of the EU Member

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:27,030
States so this is literally human rights

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,980
the last two there are actually

00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,590
expressed as obligations of controllers

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,670
rather than rights of individuals but

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,520
for the purposes of discussion they're

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,810
relevant they are if someone is

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,470
processing personal data about you you

00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:42,830
have a right to have access to that data

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:46,170
you have a right to correct errors in it

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,060
you've got a health records or a common

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,800
example that have infinite information

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,690
about what you're allergic to or your

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,750
medical history that may in fact

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,670
endanger your life so you have of course

00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,250
the right to access that information

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,080
from anyone who holds it and if it's

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,780
incorrect to correct it likewise things

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,280
like credit ratings as a more direct

00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,500
example where the rectification comes in

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,930
it is information that someone else's

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,089
debt unpaid the damaging your credit

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,980
reference then you get by the

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:15,639
borrow or it will be more expensive for

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,829
you to borrow your right to fix that

00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:21,079
people right of arisia in a whole lot of

00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:22,459
cases unless there are specific

00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:26,269
compelling reasons and I'll get to those

00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:28,519
you can simply instruct a controller to

00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:31,009
delete data about you and they are

00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,509
legally obliged to do so and to confirm

00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:36,620
that they have done so and to do so

00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:38,509
within 30 days restriction of processing

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,189
is related this came up for the Royal

00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,839
London free hospital and google deepmind

00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:45,170
i would point out that the fault here

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,300
was the hospitals and not googles they

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,139
went through the entire process to

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,779
ensure that what they were doing was

00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:53,379
legitimate with respect to using the

00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:56,689
machine learning technique for better

00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:57,980
diagnosis however while they said oh

00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:01,040
yeah and you can go and do a bunch of

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,470
test cases completely outside the

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,360
process failing to perform the

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,699
assessment and failing to recognize that

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,660
doing so would bias the resulting

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:14,449
machine learning in ways that were not

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:19,699
anticipated within the assessment the

00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:21,050
regulator was graceful enough to invite

00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:23,449
the hospital Sai an enforceable

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,129
undertaking that ran about 15 pages

00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,999
basically to do a bunch of things that

00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,879
was supposed to have done in the first

00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:31,389
place and didn't live you fine but they

00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,889
published it this is a common thing for

00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:36,290
particular GDP our regulators they'd

00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,790
rather change behavior than punish if I

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,790
can do so by saying here's what's

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:43,490
expected here's someone who did it wrong

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,160
and here's how we will react nicely if

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:50,329
you clean up your act fast which is a

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,399
not lady at 2105 data portability

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,740
doesn't apply universally but certainly

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,019
in cases where you provide the data the

00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,790
this is a bit like sort of your money in

00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:01,429
the bank account and they'll make a

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,290
welcome back to that analogy the

00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:05,170
controller is obliged not only to make

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,089
the data available to you upon request

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,949
but to also to facilitate the automated

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:14,259
transfer to some other controller

00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:17,300
including a competitor so are they

00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:19,939
think Google takeout perhaps as a as an

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,730
example of a first Catalan mechanism of

00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:25,430
this kind but the idea is that the act

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:28,160
of engaging a controller to process data

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,930
for you should not lock you in it should

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,149
be possible for you to move a bit like

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,740
be able to move phone numbers be able to

00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:36,379
keep your phone on when you move between

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,850
tell codes that you shouldn't be locked

00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:41,420
in by the fact that it's difficult to

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:43,279
shift there are rights of objection I

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,930
won't dig deeply into those but they're

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,279
basically if you don't happy with

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:50,509
something that the controller has done

00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:53,959
then to call battlenet and have them

00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:56,060
formally explain themselves and there's

00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,829
an unnamed right to be free from

00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,000
automated decision-making but have made

00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,250
you only those that have major effects

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,050
the fact that a ticket barrier won't let

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,250
you through if there's something wrong

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:09,110
with your electronic ticket he's not

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:12,410
something anything going sort of file a

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:17,300
complaint about well you can rather

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:19,730
things like credit decisions access to

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,089
welfare enrollment on electoral vote

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,529
Ledger's all those sort of things if you

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,809
are unhappy with an automated decision

00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:29,029
you have a legally enforceable right to

00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:31,730
have the controller have a human being

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:33,709
review the decision and document that

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,540
review and the basis of other retaining

00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,949
the decision or modifying it and a

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,259
failure to do so within 30 days is

00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:41,870
itself an action that's whether that's a

00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:45,589
breach of the regulation and is itself

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,790
actionable as a breach the transparency

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:48,649
and the integrity completely also the

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,670
transparency is important because if the

00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,899
controller is not transparent of what

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,370
they're doing then there's no way for

00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,480
you to exercise these rights if you

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,339
don't know that someone's processing

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,459
data about you but you can't even stop

00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:59,720
its process so there's a mechanism by

00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,610
which you must announce that you are

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,899
processing data generates registration

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:08,059
with a regulator and finally obligations

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:11,240
of integrity and confident already this

00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:13,100
is sort of too obvious to say that's why

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,019
it doesn't turn up as a right but if you

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,029
are entrusting confidential personal

00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:19,009
information to an organization to

00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:19,550
process then they're obliged to keep it

00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:21,430
confidential

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,900
they can't turn around

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,710
still out having told you they were

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:30,970
going to otherwise so this doesn't look

00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:33,250
a whole lot like the FSF's essential

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,570
freedoms axis is a little bit like

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,550
access to the code rectification is a

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,900
bit like modifying the code to fix bugs

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:43,510
but the rest is just clearly unrelated

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:46,360
notice one day that the different way to

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,130
think about them information security is

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,950
a function in most organizations that

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:54,010
provides to the board and Psyche holders

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,420
a set of capabilities with respect to

00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,680
information possessed about the system

00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,300
by the organization and the systems used

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,100
to process that information those

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,279
capabilities are traditionally

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,559
confidentiality medical records stay

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,939
secret integrity the errors are

00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,900
corrected or don't exist and

00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,429
availability

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,160
now the latter is perhaps less obvious

00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,050
but if you are unconscious in an

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,449
emergency room

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:18,280
the people at Hendon do you need access

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,900
to your medical records it's not ok to

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,199
say oh the computers down come back next

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:25,750
week so availability is a somewhat

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,240
important other often overlooked piece

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,800
of information security then there's

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,290
another it's named a few different ways

00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,340
accountability trustworthiness its

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:39,309
flights different ways depending on

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:41,290
whose scheme you look at but the ability

00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,880
to object to be free from ultimate

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,880
decision-making and transparency are

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,120
broadly accountability applications so

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,080
this on this killing the data subject

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,050
rights in GDP are are essentially

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,940
implicit but instead of being on behalf

00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,200
of the board and the shareholders and

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,300
the regulators in society at large

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,530
they're on behalf of the individual data

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,040
subjects about compassionate leaders

00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,690
being processed another's help see or

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,100
not but it's certainly helped for me it

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,270
was a lightbulb moment my fact that

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,429
suddenly clicked for me that this is

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,570
literally security as an individual with

00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:16,540
respect to information being processed

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:19,420
about and this is certainly this shift

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,710
from data controllers having their

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,660
information that they possess into

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,270
whatever they like with two data

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,910
controllers are custodians of

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:31,270
information about you that they process

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:33,280
under your direction subjects you're

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:40,180
consenting on all objective

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:42,400
that's a shift aha you might be

00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,450
wondering therefore okay so far

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,700
understood the thing but what's the

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,470
purpose of GDP are the assumed purpose

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,920
by people who are objecting is that it's

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,940
to prevent the flow of information in

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,460
fact it's the reverse

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,160
yes harmonized the prediction of fund 1

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,380
rights and freedoms and ensure the free

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:03,520
flow of personal data this is a direct

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:05,320
quote from recital 3 on page 1 GDP arts

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,860
purpose is to ensure the free flow of

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,180
personal data so if you rap against

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,030
something it says oh my god the GDP has

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,080
stopped me from getting my thing down

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,540
firstly you've completely misunderstood

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,460
what it's about it doesn't say you can't

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,840
do it says you can do and then spells

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,840
out what you must do in order to comply

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,460
and secondly depending on what you're

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,780
doing this might be a big signal that

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,610
you need to stop doing what you're doing

00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:31,990
we think it and not because the GDP our

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,490
things are bad because you're doing

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,440
something that's inappropriate for human

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:41,320
beings so what do technologists need to

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,760
know the most surprising or one of the

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,580
three or four but the most surprising

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,120
thing that keeps coming up is what

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,740
personal data is there's a term in wide

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,530
use in the US and a bunch of other

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,850
jurisdictions including Australia

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,310
personally identifiable information and

00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,270
it's tied to only the first of these

00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:03,550
identifies like names ID numbers

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:06,130
locations am i identifiers gdpr employs

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:09,010
a much broader definition anything at

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,590
all that relates it's unidentified or

00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:14,560
even identifiable natural person is

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,570
personal data every single photograph

00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,570
that's being taken during frost Asia

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,250
includes enough information to separate

00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,930
the person whose face appears in the

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,170
photograph for another person to tell

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,400
the difference that's the effect is

00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,070
specific to the physical identity of

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,600
that that natural person the fact that

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,900
we know nothing else about the person by

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,000
their name address where they live

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,740
nonetheless it's personal data if you do

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,919
that inside the EU you are already

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,740
inside

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,879
the scope of the regulation again that's

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,049
not a problem the regulation it's not a

00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:48,450
list of what you can't do it's the

00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:51,450
opposite it's a list of what you can do

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:56,240
so you want to be a telescope but that

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:58,919
just surprises people example the

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,940
normalization framework that Philippe

00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:05,789
presented yesterday I think with the

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,159
format preserving civilization of things

00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:09,570
like phone numbers so you are replacing

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,509
that correct phone number with one that

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,269
is still the right format but has it you

00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:17,009
look up key somewhere such as good name

00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:19,470
hey it's still personal in a file

00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:23,039
because if you have the key you can map

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:25,259
it back to individual but B you might

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:29,070
have mapped to the phone number of

00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:31,080
another natural person well let's

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,429
identify that relate to a person even

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,070
though you only got there coincidentally

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:36,990
you are processing data that relates

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,330
that person you have legally enforceable

00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,320
rights well that person is leaving force

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,590
will rights against you even though you

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,980
don't know who they are so it's a very

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:49,110
very very broad definition only the

00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,259
other big one it's not limited there's

00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:55,740
nothing about this that limits at the

00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:57,029
confidential data the mere fact that

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,690
you've been named as having been

00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:04,980
convicted of murder in a newspaper is

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:08,070
not sufficient excuse for a web host or

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,230
a website search index Google example to

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,840
continue processing or even retaining

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:15,480
that information that's the right to

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,529
razor for this country so the the thing

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,850
I'm talking about aren't just about the

00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:20,570
squid data they're about anything at all

00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:23,519
about human being and it back to the

00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,019
EDPs opinion there's a whole of public

00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,500
data that can be used to profile you and

00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:31,879
more precisely manipulate so GDP our

00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,879
scope includes the whole lot

00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:36,820
time for time so very quickly telescope

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,380
generally if you are inside the

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,270
jurisdiction of an EU Member State then

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,140
all president personal data is subject

00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:45,520
to the regulation if you are outside

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,640
then you come into the regulation scope

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,840
under two circumstances one is you're

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,870
promoting goods and services to people

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,059
within even if they're free but

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,650
certainly if they're for money marketing

00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:00,309
is the big ones here profiling you're

00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,809
inside you must then comply the other is

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:04,330
if you're doing anything that qualifies

00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:05,950
as monitoring this is unfortunate it's a

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,049
difficult to say what monitoring is and

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,120
isn't when you actually it down to it

00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:18,490
but roughly if you are observing change

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:19,870
at a time lawful basis might be most of

00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,000
my time on this this is really really

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,350
important processing is lawful if and

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,020
only if you fit one of these six buckets

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:29,110
if you don't you are breaking the law

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:32,350
it's that but there are two scope

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,610
exceptions incidentally domestic so

00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,320
friend's phone numbers in your phone no

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,429
problem

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,440
judicial if you work for a court

00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:39,090
different set of rules but everybody

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,350
else

00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,840
every for-profit company every nonprofit

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:47,080
it be political party every government

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,390
body every quango the whole lot are

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,760
within the scope of the regulation the

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,070
six base is the first one is consent

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,440
I'll get to the rules for consent in a

00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,510
moment they're extraordinarily high it

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,780
works for marketing it's not much good

00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:03,960
for a great many other things the

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:06,160
tenancy to attempt to consent Lauda is

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,940
understandable look bad it's not enough

00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,260
to have common-law consent necessary

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,299
performance of a contract if I'm you

00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,130
commerce provider and you place an order

00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:16,809
with me to build at your home of

00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,760
necessity I will give you address tool

00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:23,140
Korea I don't need your consent for that

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,549
I'm legally obliged compliance of legal

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,370
obligation mostly for for regular

00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:31,240
industries so bank kyc stuff you don't

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:33,809
need consent for them predict vital

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,330
interests someone's gonna die okay

00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:39,900
disclosed now hug you later public

00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:42,610
interest or official duty importantly

00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,929
public interest is not DIY it must be in

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,380
a way that's built out him remember

00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:49,120
stable distant matters to archivists you

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,120
can't archive personal data in the you

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,900
and lists you have member state law

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,980
stating our water is and finally the

00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,890
determine interests and this is where a

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,150
whole lot of stuff comes up that as long

00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,800
as what's being pursued the faders

00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,300
gained the differently and they're just

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,169
being pursued as legitimately then you

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,580
can't process however you've got to do

00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:11,559
the balancing exercise with the data

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,900
subject human rights there's a standard

00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:16,000
way to do it it takes a few hours it's

00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,440
not terribly difficult but it has to be

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,300
done it's gotta be documented it's gotta

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,630
be better to data subjects and to the

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,630
regulators

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:27,150
but the specification is critically

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,980
important you must know what the purpose

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,930
is and you must have documented it

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,640
firstly you look your lawful basis

00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,470
depends upon it and secondly all the

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,320
choices you will make stem from that

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:39,150
this is a another much longer decision

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,350
but just understand they do it's not

00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,910
just keep that because it might be

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,760
useful you must have a purpose in my

00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,140
stated consent limitations are

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,630
staggering

00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,830
it's got it you can't bundle it the

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,090
subject can withdraw at any time you

00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,800
must tell them prior to get a consent

00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,270
that they can withdraw at any time it

00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,490
shall be as easy to withdraw as to give

00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,710
consent all these nag bars that are

00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,510
saying accept cookies strictly speaking

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:03,000
they must then whatever nag bar allows

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,770
you to decline because it must be as

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,420
easy as if you've made it easy to

00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:09,540
consent you must also make it easy to

00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:12,540
decline you're making a cross for your

00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:15,270
own back if you don't meet all of these

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,240
then your consent is invalid for duty PR

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:20,400
purposes it's a very very very high bar

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,990
